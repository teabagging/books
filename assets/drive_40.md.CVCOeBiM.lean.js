Every chapter has a review and questions so that the reader is able to verify how much (or indeed how little) they have learned. It's easy to read and quite thorough, and for someone in a science field it's also a great reference to keep on hand for when those basic details begin to slip. I found myself consulting it frequently as I prepared for my MCAT examination, and it still has a place in my science library. As for the CD-Rom, I'm sure it's lovely, but I've never even put it in the computer. Overall a worthwhile purchase if you need a chem text."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"This text is widely used and has helped many students to understand chemistry. The sequence of topics presented is traditional. It has a good chapter on modern materials. The dual-column format of examples clearly shows problem solving strategies.This, and all other similar textbooks, are written for studnents who have appropriate background in high school sciences and reasonable reading comprehension. It is not fair to compare this book with a teacher whom you can talk face to face. Considering the poor reading skills of today's college students, most of whom have hard time with any materals written at 8th grade readability level and do have no idea on how to read and use a textbook, it is impossible for any textbook to do the magic of enlightening them.The companion website of this text has thousands of problems available for practice, much more than most other similar textbook websites. Learning chemistry is like learning how to play tennis. You can't expect to learn how to play tennis by watching tennis matches on TV. Similarly, you can't expect to learn chemistry by simply reading the textbook or watching your professors solve problems in class. You have to practice. If this is the text you are using, take advantage of this good resource. Students using other texts are not as lucky as you are.For a slightly more engaging text, see the one by Moore, Stanitski and Jurs."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I found this book to be very easy to read and follow. There are lots of pictures, diagrams, graphs, and tables which aide in understandin the text. There are review sections and questions at the end of every chapter so it is easy to tell if you have learned the material or not, plus you get plenty of practice. It covers all the basic advanced highschool chemistry and is a great book to go through before freshmen level chemistry in college. Overall this book is an excellent learning tool weather you are using it in a class or just using it for a reference for upper level chemistry classes."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I am a teacher using this book for an AP Chem class. I have found the book very difficult to use. Topics are rather disconnected and most of my students had trouble following the logic of more difficult subjects. The early chapters are particularly difficult. I have also found numerous mistakes with the materials available to teachers. The number of errors on the power point presentations are ridiculous. I also questions some of the answers with regards to the use of significant fiqures.The Web Site is excellent even though I only use the standard version and not the electronic chapters. The solution manual is so-so. Sometimes shortcuts are used without explanation which is dangerous for AP students.I would not recommend this book for use in the high school classroom from the point of view of both the teacher using the books and materials and the student attempting to learn from the book."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I took a first year Chemistry course through an online school. That means I had little interaction with a prof and none with fellow students. To supplement my work there I bought this text.The text is readable, yet technically sound and thorough. It puts a knowledge carrot in front of your nose and never fails to let you grab it as you strive from one point of fascination to the next. Examples are clear and problems range from easy to quite challenging. Using this text as my main source I managed 95% for my first year course.Bar none - the best Chemistry text I have ever seen."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"This book gives a great overview of freshman chemistry.

What a deal!"},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I am taking this book for college and it is truly very good. It covers every content for inorganic chemistry. Moreover, the fancy pictures, explanations, examples, essays ease the learning experienfce that you may entail with this book.The supplementary website and CD-ROM are pretty helpful as well. Specially the website, I like it very much because it had 3-D pictures of experiments and bonds, which help you to imagine the reaction menchanism of inorganic compounds.The exercise section is extensive 80 question for each section. The same type of exercises repeat often, yet they really help if someone wants to practice more and more for a test.For someone who has taken stoichometry, inorganic naming, gas laws, bonding and basic concepts of inorganic chemistry (like me) in High School, then teh first sections might be useless. However, the last sections which covers thermochemistry, electrochemistry are quite intriguing and interesting.Overall, I think this is a great book as I mentioned. Although I think that I would buy one edition earlier since the contents do not vary very much (but the price does!)"},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I definitely love to learn, but it's always a pain when the book is poorly written, this is not the case with The Central Science by Theodore Brown.

It explains the topics in good detail, but sticks to the point and doesn't start talking about some other topic. The explanations are really thorough and they have some really good 3-D images that help you visualize molecules better (this is useful especially for molecular bonding). Another great feature of this book is the summary they give at the end of each chapter and the numerous sample problems with FULL EXPLANATIONS for each step you take. Unlike other chemistry books that are vague and confusing, this textbook is able to thoroughly explain subjects without all the confusing terms that you'll find in other chemistry books."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I am quite satisfied with this text.

Not like &quot;So here's the deal, if you look at those electrons... ,&quot; blah blah.. the author is talking to a child.. basically.....I found Raymond Chang's 6th Edition of CHemistry to be more straight forward. I don't like the &quot;JARGON&quot; in textbooks. That should be left to professors and university itself. Although, people who skip classes would like this textbook, I wouldn't keep it for reference (too much jargon, hard to get and find the point)."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"i think being on it's 9th edition has made it almost errorless.... i couldn't find any errors at all... and as refined the pedagology of the material....excellent book"},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I'm shocked why nobody write review for it.It's a great book, and i used it for AP chemistry course.I got 5 for that exam.The book is clear, easy to read, and most importantly it covers all the topics for AP chemistry, although the collegeboard didn't add it to their text list, but I highly recommand it.This book also has a CD, it helped me a lot visualizing mant complex reactions which can not made clear on paper.IT IS A GREAT BUY!"},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"This book is simply great. i've seen one or two other books during my two years of study in chemistry (AP and college), and this book was the best.

The book was very easy to read compared to others and the examples were straight forward and easy to follow. The authors also attempted to include scientific/medical relevance to some of the issues covered. The most difficult chapter in the book to read is quantum theory; however, this topic is typically difficult for anyone to understand at first.This book will be going to medical school with me this fall for sure."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I bought the book to review General Chemistry that I took many years ago because I am taking Organic Chemistry this Fall. The book covers General Chemistry quite well. It is highly readable and develops ideas progressively. The reader is never faced with a term or concept that has not already been explained. The back references interspersed throughout will save the reader many hours of looking into the index to find a topic that was covered earlier in the book. I also purchased the solutions manual and was generally pleased. Apart from the occasional error , the manual provides solutions to EVERY problem which is an enormous help. The book does have a weakness which is relatively unimportant to most readers including this one. Chapters 24 and 25 are devoted to Coordination Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. In these chapters, it almost seems as if the text was written ( or edited ) by a person or group other than those who produced the first 23 chapters. The book no longer serves the reader and you will be forced ( without too much consternation ) to purchase a proper Organic Chemistry text. The authors might have done better to lighten the load in every undergraduate's backpack and simply delete Chapters 24 and 25."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I used this textbook for my AP (high school but college-level) Chemistry course, and found it to be delightfully clear and simple reading. Everything is explained to be perfectly understandable, and after simply reading the book through and doing the exercise problems (as assigned by my teacher), I found the actual AP exam to be literally one of the easiest tests I have ever taken in my life.Actually, in fact, I barely paid any attention in class; I simply read this book and paid half-attention in class, and simply by reading this book throughly, I was one of the best students in the class.It is clear why my teacher said she selected this book as the best she had seen."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"This is a thorough, well-writen, and edifying introductory chemistry book.

Robbie Davis-Floyd has studied these rituals of birth; why taking the ride to L&amp;D in the wheelchair sets up an invalid mindset in the laboring woman, and how the lithotomy position robs the woman of her birthing power, forcing her to rely on the medical professions to deliver her baby for her.It is powerful stuff and difficult to accept, but truth sometimes is."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"If you really want to know what to expect when you're expecting, read this book and Henci Goer's Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth. If you'd really like to remove yourself from the technobirth machine, read Ina May Gaskin's Ina May's Guide to Childbirth and Spiritual Midwifery. If you've always thought you might want a natural birth, read Peggy O'Mara's Having a Baby, Naturally. And remember this one thing: If you really (really) want a natural, unmedicated birth, don't give birth in a hospital."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"If you are a woman looking for a thoughtful review of our modern birthing culture this is a wonderful book. I have read a lot about birth options, perspectives of the birth experience, and midwifery history and philosophy but went away wanting for more. My desire to really explore an informed text about our birthing culture was finally satiated by this book. I am not an anthropologist by training and yet found the book accessible, educational, and challenging. I really suggest this book be read by everyone interested in the birth experience, partners, attendants, birthing woman, or children of technocracy."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"This was a paradigm blowing must read for any woman. A fluid read and with intense narratives. The most educational book I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"Ok, I'm feeling a little self-conscious being the first male reviewer of this book on Amazon, but here it is. Everyone should read this book, male or female, American or not, whatever. This book will change the way you look not only at childbirth but at the medical profession and society as a whole. It's a fascinating read. Most of the book is applicable throughout most of the world.Pregnant women of course will get out of this a social critique regarding the approaches to childbirth in hospitals, how these support and ensure the continuation of patriarchy in our society, etc. Women who are not pregnant will gain from it a different sense of modern medicine and society as a whole. Men are likely to be confronted with a great deal of information about the nature of culture and things we take for granted all the time.In the end, this is a solid piece of anthropology, and moreover it does well what women's studies are supposed to do: provide a new angle over well-trodden ground which explores the cultural contradictions regarding gender roles in modern society. This is not a book full of laments of lost prestige (as stereotypes might lead one to presume), but rather a careful, reasoned critique of how our culture operates and how this is intensified during the childbirth process. It further explores why so many women accept and embrace patriarchy in childbirth.More to the point, this book will challenge how you look at health care more generally and its relationship to societal values. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"This book offers really great insight into what happens when technology and pregnancy meet in American culture as well as to the responses to the American technocratic approach to childbirth. I really liked that she included doctor's perspectives, giving the reader a look at both sides of the coin. She explored not only women who felt victimized by their experiences in hospitals, but also women who felt empowered by the same experiences. To her shock, she found that more women actually feel safer and more comfortable with a highly technocratic birth and she examines why this might be.The book was very insightful but I found some slow chapters in the middle of the book that seemed to result from saying the same things over and over. I also constantly found myself amazed at some of the experiences of women in hospitals and asking myself if this information is still relevant today considering this book was written in 1992 and a lot of her research was dated in the late 80s. Never the less, it is a great recent history of childbirth in American hospitals. The attitudes of the doctors and women interviewed for this work surely continue to reflect, in many ways, the attitudes still held today considering it wasn't THAT long ago.I recommend this book to women who plan to have their baby in a hospital because I think that it will serve to inform and as a result empower. If you seek to stay in control of your body and the birth of your child, this book would offer much insight. For women who do not want to have their children in the hospital, well, this book will only confirm why you feel that way."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"this is a very important book. it may be a little heavy on the (anthropological) jargon for some people but it is worth it. it's an eye-opening study of the medicalization of birth in our culture and it's really interesting, upsetting, and informative. she includes many interviews with women who have birthed in hospitals and obstetricians describing their socialization/training/beliefs. i do believe that any woman giving birth owes it to herself to explore this issue. it is actually statistically less safe for low-risk women to deliver in a hospital than at home with a competent midwife (in terms of maternal & fetal infections and deaths). whether you already know that you want an epidural or if you are hoping for a natural birth, you should become aware of the practices that are commonplace in hospitals so that you can make informed decisions about what is right for you and your baby. it is possible (though very challenging) to have a \\"natural\\" birth in a hospital but it is a constant uphill battle to avoid the numerous dangerous interventions the medically-oriented practitioners try to push on women without evidence that they help (indeed, with research that shows that they hinder the progress of labor or make recovery more difficult for the woman)."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"I thought I was going to die trying to get through the first 40 pages, but soon after, it improved dramatically. I think what made it difficult to read was the thesis format. Much of the information is very interesting, and this book would most likely be best suited for OBGYNs, midwives, childbirth educators, doulas, or the mother that just loves to read anything pregnancy, birth, or parenting related (which is the category I fall into). I do not regret reading it in the least and it gave me a new perspective for what OBGYNs have to go through to become doctors, so I have more sympathy and understanding for them. But it doesn't excuse the ridiculous rites of passage they put women through, it just explains where they came from. But, just as I would suspect, the book concludes that most women go into a hospital birth fully expecting and welcoming those rituals...which is their business to choose."},{"Title":"Birth as an American Rite of Passage: Second Edition, With a New Preface","review":"Robbie Davis-Floyd has a unique voice as a cultural anthropologist, midwife, educator, author and mother. Birth as an American Rite of Passage highlights the trends that continue: pregnant women are often considered patients and medical interventions in prenatal and maternity care is pervasive. Frequently obstetricians are trained with technocratic and not humanistic models. Many of us have witnessed this first hand, particularly if we were of Advanced Maternal Age, the sisterhood of women age 35 or better. We were labeled high risk following our pregnancy test and before understanding our complete personal health histories. (I write about my experience with this on our website.) For women of all ages, Ms. Davis-Floyd's examples of electronic fetal monitoring in labor and laboring in a supine position, which are the hospital standards across much of the world, are truly impediments for the best birth for many women. She reminds us that caregivers' attitudes and ideologies about childbirth have a direct outcome on the women they work with. Ms. Davis-Floyd adds important perspectives on how women are cared for in other countries, including throughout Latin America and Europe and the practice of midwives. Her book is compelling and should be required reading for caregivers and the women who seek to become mothers with their support."},{"Title":"Dust from Old Bones","review":"I read this book and thought it was wonderful literature.

I hope this review appears objective in order to help possible purchasers. The criticisms:1. The CD program does not follow any apparent sequence/order, nor does the instructor provide any headings for each new section (I am generous with the word section here). I think this is important since one is relying completely on the instructor without the benefit of the book (compare Penton's Learn in Your Car series - short lessons, in a logical sequence, which are always introduced by the speakers - a far better organized course) With the Behind the Wheel program you will have no idea where you are (or why), or where you are going;2. A great deal of the program is repetitive, although Frobose advises that repetition and review are important to the foreign language acquisition process. Admittedly, repetition and review are important - but why waste valuable time repeating &quot;It's 5:30&quot; 50 times when more time could be devoted to providing additional material? (I think numbers were repeated approx. 10 times - perhaps more) Repetition, it seems, is something better accomplished on subsequent listens;3. Although more of a personal matter, I found Frobose to sound somewhat condescending. The &quot;native&quot; speaker is almost comical in the way he over-pronounces each word. Certainly, the words are expressed clearly, but if you pronounce the words in the same way as the native speaker, I am sure you will get some raised eyebrows; and,4. Some reviewers suggest the interesting phrases/idioms are helpful for sounding &quot;native.&quot; Honestly, the isolated phrases presented throughout the course have no context - they just come &quot;out of the blue.&quot; Further, the phrases are not broken down for an understanding of the words/phrase (for a true &quot;building block&quot; system see Michel Thomas' Spanish with Michel Thomas. With MT you will build from an understanding of one word, then two, then three, etc. until you can formulate a sentence)I would not suggest any one purchase this course. If you are looking for a solid foundation, start with Michel Thomas to gain an understanding of the structure of the language. I would follow MT with Learn in Your Car (3 volume) for additional structure and vocabulary (which MT lacks).Hope this helps in the foreign language quest."},{"Title":"Behind The Wheel Spanish For Your Car / 8 One Hour Audiocassette Tapes / Complete Learning Guide and Tape Script (Cassette) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I am delighted with the excellent results I am getting from Behind the Wheel Spanish.

I thought the sound quality was poor and the methodology was equally poor. There is little repetition and though the speaker requests that the listener repeat phrases, little time is given to repeat the phrases.

After several failed attempts to learn Spanish in a classroom setting I finally decided to make use of the many hours I spend in my car during the week. My car \\"trips\\" are relatively short (10-20 minutes), but several trips each day add up! I just keep the tape going... even when I feel distracted. When I'm actively engaged in the tape I stop it frequently to guess answers, or repeat Spanish sentences so that I can reinforce the new information and practice pronunciation. When I'm thinking about what I need to do tomorrow I just let the lesson go in one ear and out the other. I started learning how to make USEFUL conversation with tape one, and felt an IMMEDIATE sense of accomplishment. I haven't rushed this. I listen to each tape several times, trying to memorize as much as I can before moving on to the next tape. I'm now on Tape 3, side 2. The tapes repeat the nuts and bolts of prior lessons while adding new words and verb tenses. So, there is plenty of opportunity for review. The tapes are delivering EVERYTHING I had hoped for. I keep the accompanying book beside my bed - which has a transcript of each tape as well as lists of important words. I occasionally review what I have listened to that day. I find it helpful to actually \\"see\\" the words/spelling, but it is certainly not necessary. I am really appreciating the learning method utilized... I highly recommend Behind the Wheel Spanish!!

This one was disappointing. It did not seem to follow a particular lesson plan and struck me as disorganized. I felt like I simply had to memorize phrases - the reasons for specific word order, usages, etc. were not expressed. At times, it seemed to repeat endlessly, so that on several CDs it repeats how you say the time of day (unnessary in a CD where you can rewind).Good language CDs allow you to understand what you're saying *and* why it is said that way. If it is instead intended as an immersion program (this one is not), it is organized in a progressive manner so that you are constantly reaching a little further with each lesson and expanding your knowledge. And in either case, although review is important, each review adds something to your understanding. This CD set did not meet those criteria.However, there were some interesting phrases included. Having used other CD sets, I understood the language enough that this CD set enhanced my learning despite that it did not include explanations and is not progressive. The pronunciation seemed clear. It seems like a fairly good program if you want to learn phrases to memorize for travel. And the book is quite good despite all of its errors/typos.I would recommend this CD set if you already have a background in Spanish language and want to reacquaint yourself with it. If you are fairly new, this is not a good way to introduce yourself to the language. I preferred Michel Thomas for actually learning how to construct sentences (I used the 8-CD set), although his definitely is not travel-oriented. I liked Pimsleur for pronunciation, although it did not progress very quickly."},{"Title":"Behind The Wheel Spanish For Your Car / 8 One Hour Audiocassette Tapes / Complete Learning Guide and Tape Script (Cassette) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Very disappointing.

It includes a short biography of Ayn Rand but the bulk of the book is spent on detailed going over of Ayn Rand's plot, theme, and characters. It is fascinating to read an intelligent analysis of the characters I love. The gems of the book are the two critical essays; The Literary Integration of the Fountainhead and Ayn Rands Writing Style. This book is written by an Objectivist author and is definately worth buying."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Rand's The Fountainhead","review":"Bernstein clears up many misunderstandings or deliberate distortions by unsympathetic critics. Rand's style of writing may be jarring to those who prefer Naturalism. It is worth reading or re-reading Rand with a guide and/or commentary. However, don't deprive yourself of the experience of entering and immersing yourself in Rand's world, which requires reading the novel. Use the guide sparingly as clarification is needed. Unfortunately, Bernstein sometimes refers to future events in chapters not yet read - be forewarned."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Rand's The Fountainhead","review":"Bernstein provides a penetrating insight to this brilliant novel of ideas. Included are: a brief synopsis, a list of characters, a character map, critical commentaries on each of the four parts (with glossaries of important terms), detailed analyses of the major and minor characters, and an essay on Ayn Rand's writing style. There are even review questions, essay questions, and practice projects. The only complaint I have is that Bernstein doesn't describe the differences between the novel and the movie script--and there are differences. In some respects, Objectivist philosophy is an outgrowth of (and considerable improvement over) Nietzsche's philosophy. Bernstein points out on p. 59 that Rand kept a quote from Nietzsch at the head of her manuscript which says that there is \\"some fundamental certainty that a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps also, is not to be lost.\\""},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Rand's The Fountainhead","review":"This book really helps a reader see &quot;the big picture&quot;.

Reading CliffsNotes on TheFountainhead is like sitting down for coffee with a better-educated friend with a high IQ and great insight who had a better night's sleep than you did. The Fountainhead went from 2D to 3D for me with the help of CN's comments.Before CN: So what's the big whup. There's producers and there's the rest of us. Nothing new about that.After CN: Those who implement the Big Ideas of the producers are &#34;second handers,&#34; really parasites on the productivity and brilliance of the Thinkers of Great Thoughts. They are banal moochers and got no reason to live.Ayn Rand's elitist ideas would destroy an America that stands for equal opportunity for all and values the contribution of the hundreds and even thousands who make the dreamer's dreams come true and keep this country afloat. We second handers are the little people --the only ones who pay taxes, according to Leona Helmsley. We don't keep out money in the Caymen Islands to avoid contributing to the infrastructure of the country that made us rich.CliffNotes doesn't say what I just did--that's just my opinion. What I like best about CN is that it lays it all out for you as to what the big ideas are that make a book a classic and why it remains so. What could be more germaine today than Ayn Rand? Paul Ryan mentioned objectivism (the name she gave to her philosophy of money to the producers and to hell with everyone else).Howard Rourke blew up the hotel that was not designed per his specifications and part of Rand's message was that the world was not worthy of Rourke's &#34;purity.&#34;I have one criticism of this book. It would have been helpful to me if CN had connected &#34;The Fountainhead&#34; with Rand's movement of objectivism and mentioned that later in her life she lived on Social Security. Also, another important historical connection is the nihilism present in this book and her next, &#34;Atlas Shrugged.&#34; In this one, the perfect man protagonist blows up the building. In the next, he leaves town for a capitalist Shangri-La in Colorado and secretly lures away all the producers he can to join him there, thus shaking the world.Now I have to buy the CN for the books I've already read so I can make sure I didn't miss any Deep Thoughts....."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Rand's The Fountainhead","review":"This has everything you need to pass a test or write a paper on this arduously long novel.

This is truly one of history's great stories and well worth the effort. If you are well versed in the topic, you won't find much new here.Perhaps the best account of \\"The Bunker\\" is actually a film made in Germany a few years ago based on the memoirs of Gertraud Junge. She was one of the secretaries who stayed to the very end with the \\"Fuhrer\\". If you are not intimidated by sub titles it is a riveting experience."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Fest's haunting description of the last days of the Third Reich is a magnificent accomplishment. Despite its brevity, Fest manages to weave larger historical issues into a narrative full of surreal, compelling details about the Nazis' end. There are the evocative stories of Berlin in turmoil: SS patrols summarily hanging whoever they felt was a shirker, citizens struggling to survive in the shelled-out ruin of a city, the Soviet encirclement growing ever closer. Meanwhile, inside the Hitler's bunker, the story of delusion and denial grew ever more fantastical -- Hitler commanding generals to counterattack the Russians with army units existing in his imagination, and growing more and more furious with their \\"betrayals\\" as the Russian advance still came on.The story arrives ultimately at the Russian approach to the bunker and the suicides of Hitler, Eva Braun, and the inner circle. Their grimly nihilistic end, burned in a trashheap, paralleled their desire for the same fate for Germany. Hitler wanted Germany to go down with him. That so many in Berlin actually did follow him in suicide, or fighting the Russians to the end against suicidal odds, seems now almost too bewildering to believe. Fest's book is bleak, but in a straightforward journalistic style argues why the end in the bunker was the culmination of Hitler's theatrical, nihilistic vision."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"During his last days, a stooped Adolf Hitler shuffled through the corridors of his underground bunker in Berlin. Sometimes he had to stop and lean against the concrete walls, because he had trouble keeping his balance. Hitler appeared to be at the point of complete physical collapse, but that appearance was deceptive. He still had a ferocious will to destroy, and he would keep that will to the very end. \\"Inside Hitler's Bunker\\" tells the story of that end. This is a short book, but there is much depth of understanding within it. There is understanding about Hitler's motivation and real purpose, and the total destruction of the world that he created in Germany between 1933 and 1945. The final wave of nightmarish events that took place in Hitler's bunker are vividly described in this book. From these pages it is clear that Hitler's only legacy to Germany and the world was one of utter devastation and ruin."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Given Fest's reputation as a -- or even the -- leading German historian of the Nazi period, I found the book somewhat disappointing. Its sketchy narrative really adds nothing new to our understanding of the bunker period. It is best seen as a very brief introduction to the terminal period of the Third Reich and some of its more significant figures, but that is about the extent of its contribution. As others have noted, there are many far superior books available for those with an interest in this topic."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"I found Joachim Fest's book to be a fascinating documentary of Hitler's final days. It clearly describes Hitler's state of mind during the fall of Berlin and Germany.Hitler was a delusional fanatic, and history bears this out. This book takes us inside the actual bunker where Hitler plans his own wedding, and his suicide, as an entire country descends into chaos and ruin around him.If you are a World War II history buff like me, then this book is a must read.

But it also reveals the anguish and desperation of a dictator during his last days on earth.Mitch Paioff, Author, Getting Started as an Independent Computer ConsultantGetting Started as an Independent Computer Consultant"},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"I'm always fascinated by this final phase. So much of the killing went on the last few months that, even though you know the ending, you read these narratives urging the Allies to hurry up. When they took Anne Frank they could hear the sound of the British guns in Amsterdam. Mysteries remain. I found no fresh revelations that were not in Trevor-Roper's \\"Last Days of Hitler.\\" Trevor-Roper actually spoke to many of those who were there and was given full access by the Allied authorities. (I haven't read Gertaud Junge's book yet.) This has the interest of being written by a German, born in 1926, but gives no inkling of what his personal feelings were as a 19 year old German at that time. It was written for German audience. The translation by Dembo is seamless and having been from from the German translated sensations find we not. The last pages contain sentences like \\"Instead what dominated the entire sequence of events and cost countless lives was an undeterred will, locked in its own mad, delusional world on the one hand, and a deeply calculated obsequiousness on the other.\\" I think that's the fault of the author's style not Dembo. An American would have said \\"these people were crazy.\\"I'm haunted by the thought of Frau Goebbels killing her six children. A poignant detail here is the evidence that the 12 year old struggled for her life. Even more thought-provoking is the Russian soldier coming upon the children's bodies and not able to bear to look.(Those details aren't in Trevor-Roper).Compared with Trevor-Roper this gives more detail about what went on after Hitler's death, but you might turn to the other WWII histories for that.

In \\"Inside Hitler's Bunker,\\" he focuses on the last days of the Third Reich, beginning his narrative on April 16, 1945 as the Soviets open their final offensive against Berlin. The book explores the surreal and miserable world of the \\"Fuhrer Bunker\\" under the Reich Chancellery, the fanatical resistance and eventual collapse of the German armies defending Berlin, Hitler's delusional attempts to command armies that had been wiped out, and the astonishing willingness of soldiers and civilians to obey his orders until the very end.This is a highly readable and very powerful book, and the translator (Margot Bettauer Dembo) deserves high marks for the result. I read the book avidly, and as soon as I was done my wife picked it up and did the same.\\"Inside Hitler's Bunker\\" may be somewhat disappointing for those who have read a great deal about the Battle of Berlin or Hitler's last days (the book does not appear to break a great deal of new ground), but it will prove to be a gripping narrative for those who are new to the horrors of Berlin in 1945. Part of the continuing fascination of this dark time is the challenge of trying to understand the incomprehensible: how could a madman like Hitler stay in control of Germany in the last weeks of April 1945, and why did so many Germans follow him as he dragged them into the final catastrophe?The answer to those questions may lie in the 12 years of indoctrination that preceded those fateful days in 1945. For a brief and readable perspective on this period (which has been thoroughly explored in numerous more massive tomes), you may want to try \\"Inside Hitler's Germany: Life Under the Third Reich\\" by Matthew Hughes and Chris Mann."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"We have our own evils to contemplate in the twenty-first century, but the demon Hitler will forever occupy those who study the evils of the twentieth. It may be that we need reassurance that he is really and permanently dead, because the story of his end has been told many times. There was room, however, for a comprehensive summary of Hitler's last days, and we now have one, told by a German who is a historian of the Third Reich and a reporter. Joachim Fest, in _Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), has pulled together evidence and drawn a dramatic picture of those final days, and the immediate aftermath. It won't be the last volume to examine this extraordinary subject, but it should be the current reference for anyone interested in it.Hitler had known that the war was lost; he said as much four years before the Russians started to close upon Berlin. After the Ardennes offensive failed, Hitler had returned to Berlin, where the air raids drove him for refuge into the bunker he had prepared for himself and his cronies. It was more than thirty feet below the ground, about twenty reinforced rooms with few furnishings, even in Hitler's private rooms. Each room had a naked lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. The water system was untrustworthy, ventilation was bad, and diesel exhaust often pervaded the inside. It was grim, and even Goebbels avoided the rooms as much as possible because they caused a \\"desolate mood.\\" The night before his death, Hitler married Eva Braun. Retiring to his room with her, he used a pistol and cyanide to bring their ends about. In the bunker's canteen, the inmates sought relief from all the weeks of tension and danced to boisterous music over the loudspeakers. An orderly had been sent up to ask for quiet, since the Fuhrer was about to die, but no one paid any attention. The drinking and dancing only continued.There were famous reports that Hitler had survived, reports that the tabloid press made much of during the next decades; there were plenty of conspiracy theories. The Russians found a body that looked like Hitler, and insisted that they had his corpse. It was just the sort of end he had not wanted, however, and he had taken precautions to make sure it did not occur. A ration of gasoline was obtained, and the two bodies were cremated near the exit of the bunker. What happened to the remaining dust can only be guessed at; artillery shelling and flamethrowers turned the area even more chaotic. Some of Hitler's henchmen followed him in suicide, some fled. Fest's book gives a rough description of the subsequent battle for Berlin, but this is mostly a ghastly story of awful gloom within a grotesquely unnatural cave. It is a short book, in a readable translation, accompanied by vivid and shocking pictures, unrelieved by any light anecdotes or instances of individual heroism. Fest's explanation of Hitler's motivation (\\"like a gang leader, he pursued a course that never went beyond the idea of killing and looting\\") is satisfactory, but perhaps no one can explain how with no coherent version of where he was leading Germany he could have been so staunchly supported for so long. When Fest writes that Hitler's ashes wound up tamped into bombardment-plowed ground, \\"among chunks of blasted concrete and heaps of garbage,\\" it is clear that he has satisfaction that Hitler got the end he deserved."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"A recent paperback release of this little book (less than 200 pages) ties it to the movie \\"Downfall\\" (\\"Der Untergang\\") by a disc of text on the cover that reads: \\"Now the major motion picture The Downfall From Newmarket Films\\". Though the book and the movie cover the same general subject and share the same German title, the tie-in is slightly misleading. The 2004 film includes more of the perspective of one of Hitler's secretaries, Traudl Junge, while the 2002 book (translated into English in 2004) takes a more macro view of the goings on in Berlin, and Traudl Junge barely receives mention by name. Nonetheless, both provide great insights and introductions to the last days of the Third Reich (roughly April 16 - when the Soviet offensive against Berlin began - to May 8, 1945 - when what remained of the Third Reich in Berlin surrendered). Exploration of one will likely inspire exploration of the other.This book explores the true horror that unfolded during the battle for Berlin in early 1945. As Fest himself puts it in the foreward: \\"No catastrophe in recent history is comparable to the collapse of Germany in 1945.\\" Newcomers to the subject will learn much about the Third Reich, the end of World War II, and Hitler's twisted ideology of destruction. Those well versed in World War II might not gain more than a good quick read.Fest delineates the catastrophe in clear terms. The civilian population suffered tremendously under the \\"no surrender\\", \\"Clausewitz\\", and \\"scorched earth\\" policies of Hitler. Berlin was systematically dismantled while the Reich called for the unconditional support of the people of Berlin. Young children and the elderly were spontaneously shipped to the front lines. Even when those at the top of the Reich's command knew the battle could not be won against the largely superior Soviet force, they kept up the fight. This doubtlessly caused many needless deaths.Fest also includes chapters for \\"reflection\\" that explore questions arising from the war narrative. Chapter two discusses Hitler's place in German history. Was he an anamoly or the result of a cultural and political progression? Fest juxtaposes Hitler with Bismarck and Frederick the Great, and points out important differences. But the book's most disturbing chapter, \\"The Will to Destroy\\", outlines Hitler's stance on destruction, and argues that one of Hitler's underlying motives all along was base destruction. Fest uses this discussion to elucidate the seemingly bizarre and inexplicable orders Hitler gave from the bunker under the Reich Chancellery up until the end. Did Hitler see himself as a failure before he shot himself? Or did he see himself as a romantic hero &aacute; la Richard Wagner's \\"Reinzi\\"?This book will also dispell any rumors that Hitler survived the Soviet invasion of Berlin. Fest briefly details the legends that arose from the Soviets themselves around alleged Hitler corpses and Rube Goldberg-esque escape plots. The Nazis themselves, for more obvious reasons, hid Hitler's suicide from the German population of Berlin. Fest also gives probable reasons why Hitler and Eva Braun's remains were not found. He also points out areas where information remains sketchy, controversial, or nebulous.This is not a light read. It details suffering, collapse, and the miseries that inevitably arise from a war on the scale of World War II. The only bright side is that it outlines the final hours of the European war, and the end of Nazi rule in Germany. Hopefully the world will never see destruction on that scale again. Some sixty years later (almost to the day of the beginning of the battle for Berlin on April 16, 1945) we still have plenty to learn from what hopefully will remain the last World War."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"I'm an avid WWII reader, so it was with great anticipation that I began reading this book. The mystery surrounding Hitler's last days in the bunker, is such an unknown. Any book that attempts to shed light on this period in history becomes an instant best-seller.As the title of my review indicates, I am very disapointed in Joachim Fest's book. It is entirely too short and just doesn't begin to scratch the surface.There are many other works out there such as the work narrated by one of Hitler's secretarys Traudl Junge, that goes much deeper than this book.I read Fest's book in three hours and set it on the shelf feeling like I was cheated. The book is incomplete at best!"},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"I wish that I had read the negative reviews of this book and avoided it. This is a very poorly done account of Hitler's final days in the bunker. The book is poorly written, lacks linear progression, and provides an erratic treatment of the subject. The text itself is cobbled together in piecemeal fashion from other books on the subject - there seems little original here. Quotes about Hitler are often made without attribution leaving the reader to wonder whose opinion was being posited. Fest writes pages and pages of filler material consisting of his own amateur psychoanalysis of Hitler which adds nothing to the record and further sidetracks this work.If you wish to read an engaging and informative account of Hitler's final days, skip Fest's book and read instead the book written by Hitler's secretary Traudle Junge's or Ian Sayer and Douglas Botting's book The Women Who Knew Hitler which chronicles Hitler's last days extremely well."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Fest, who is the author of one of the most authoritative biographies on Hitler, focuses on the final few days of the Third Reich in his new book. This is a really riveting book, and once you get past the first 15 or so pages, you won't want to put it down. Fest does a great job at describing the general disorganization and confusion of those final days, and showing just have bad Berlin had been destroyed by the Russian and American assault upon it. I think Fest does raise some good questions about Hitler and his importance in history. Also, the speculation that Hitler's aims and goals for the Third Reich were not for the betterment of civilization, but for the eventual destruction and enslavement of it, is an apt assessment. Also, Dembo's translation is much better than the translators for some of Fest's other works, and I think this also had a lot to do with why the book was so good. The reson why I gave it only 4 stars as opposed to 5 is that it does seem a little sketchy at times in its treatment of the Bunker, but then again, much is speculation anyway. Another reason for the 4 stars is that Fest really gives no dramatically new information here, but he makes other excellent observations and such that you just can't stop reading. A good companion to this tome would be UNTIL THE FINAL HOUR by Traudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary in the Bunker, so that one can get a historical, as well as personal, perspective on the events surrounding the fall of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"This work by Joachim Fest is far less readable, informative, comprehensive, authoritative, and riveting than \\"The Bunker\\" by James P. O'Donnell, written some 24 years before. In fact, Fest does not even credit O'Donnell's 1978 book in his extensive bibliography -- perhaps a tacit attempt to keep readers from discovering a superior work. One example of the careless scholarship in Fest's book is his reference to Wilhelm Mohnke as SS Gruppenfuhrer (Major General) on page 45, and as SS Brigadefuhrer (Brigadier General)on page 66. Mohnke was indeed a Brigadefuhrer."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Mr. Fest is a competent writer, but his account here is dry, brief and for those with prior knowledge of the facts, this book is very disappointing.For a period with such plots and subplots this book is surprisingly colorless.For an excellent book on a decisive turning point in Third Reich history, I most warmly recommended \`Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943'By Antony Beevor."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"If you've just see the stunning, timeless and (frighteningly) timely film Downfall, and are looking for a companion volume or perhaps some follow- up reading to learn more about the bewildering menagerie of characters the film introduces, this is NOT it. Though an excellent book in its own right, Inside Hitler's Bunker actually provides only the briefest of glimpses inside the bunker, and even less information about the backgrounds and fates of the people in and around it during the final days of the Third Reich. Instead this short book focuses on exactly what it's original German title says it does: Hitler and the end of the Third Reich. Fest, one of the worlds leading experts on Hitler, here summarizes some of the major themes of Hitler's philosophy (if it can be called that) as it reaches its end, against the back drop of the collapse of his r&eacute;gime. The bunker and its inhabitants are visited only when necessary to aid his tour through Hitler's mind."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Personally, I like this author and I have a few of his books. This one was an average read because in a brief 200 pages, Fest describes the last days of Hitler. Trevor Roper's book even though ancient gives a better picture of the last days of Hitler than Fest's book. In Fest's book, one gets glimpses of Hitler in his last days of life. Gone are the great expectations of German Empire, and one can get a glimpse of the crazy man who led Germany for 12 years. Fest gives only glimpses of Hitler and life in the bunker. One cannot get a definitive account of all the activities of that period. One can get a better image with Trever Roper's book.I enjoyed some of the information in this book, but definitive it is not. There are better books out there than this, so if one wants a summary, this is a nice book. However if one wants a more through book, they should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Joachim Fest's Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich is a comparatively short work (179 pages) documenting the last few weeks of the Third Reich, with the general focus on the final fight for Berlin that began on 16 April and ended with the Soviet occupation of the Reich Chancellery on 2 May, 1945, and with particular focus on the doings of the Nazi leadership in the bunker complex that lay deep beneath the Chancellery.The book is at its best when Fest is describing the details of what life in the bunkers was like and on what was happening in and around Berlin in those final days. A good example of what can be found is in passages like these:\\"In each of the rooms, naked lightbulbs hung from the ceiling, casting cold light on the faces of those who were there and adding to the impression that they were all moving about in a ghost world. In the final days, the water supply occasionally failed and an almost unbearable stench spread from the Vorbunker -- exhaust fumes from the constantly humming diesel engines, mixed with the pungent smell of urine and human perspiration. Oily puddles collected in some of the corridors leading to the deep bunker, and for a time drinking water had to be rationed. Several witnesses have described the oppressive effect the cramped quarters, concrete, and artificial light had on people's spirits. In his diaries Goebbels wrote that he avoided these rooms as much as possible, so as not to fall prey to the 'desolate mood.' It's easy to understand how this remote netherworld setting contributed to the unreal decrees promulgated from there, decrees in which ghost divisions were assembled for offensive operations that never took place, and outflanking maneuvers were launched that existed only in Hitler's fantasy.--Hitler himself seems to have been most visibly ravaged by this hellish cave existence thirty-three feet below the surface. For years his skin had had a pasty look, but of late his facial features had become puffy, bloated. The heavy, dark pouches under his eyes became more and more noticable. Markedly stooped, he walked with a peculiar gait, lurching from side to side, moving along close to the bunker walls as though looking for support. Some perceptive observers had the impression that he was accentuating his frailty for dramatic effect. For the first time Hitler also showed signs of slovenliness. His clothes, which had always been painfully correct, were splattered with food stains; cake crumbs stuck to the corners of his mouth, and whenever he held his eyeglasses in his left hand during a situation conference report, they would clatter softly against the tabletop....--'He knew the game was up,' a general staff officer noted, 'and he no longer had the strength to conceal it. He was in terrible physical shape, dragging himself along slowly and laboriously from his living quarters to the bunker conference room, throwing his upper body forward and pulling his legs along. His snese of balance was impaired; if he stopped to talk to someone on this short sixty-to-ninety-foot walk, he would have to sit down on one of the benches that had been place for that purpose along both walls or hold on to whoever he was talking to.... His eyes were bloodshot, and even though all written material intended for him was typed in letters three times normal size on special 'Fuhrer typewriters,' he could only make out the writing by using eyeglasses with strong lenses. Saliva often trickled from the corners of his mouth....'\\"\\"Every day more factories, workshops, and utility companies discontinued operations. Frequently there was no running water or power for hours at a time. The use of electricity for cooking was forbidden; violators were punished with death. An unbearable stench hung over everything -- a combination of burnt flesh and the garbage and rubbled piled up on the softened asphalt. In the city center, people stayed for days on end in cellars and U-Bahn tunnels. Those few who risked coming out wrapped their faces in damp cloths to protect themselves against the acrid fumes from burning fires and phosphorus. The challenges of day-to-day survival seemed endless. The last issues of the newspapers and billboards combined strident victory rhetoric with threats, often next to bizarre advice about how to confront the great perils of everyday life. To 'improve your protein intake,' one of these recommendations read, go and catch frogs in the city's rivers and lakes. The best way to catch them was by 'dragging colorful rags along the shallows near the shore.'\\"The book also contains a number of photographs and maps, including a floorplan of the bunker complex which is particularly enlightening as to how limited the individual spaces were.The limitations of the book are largely due to its rather short length. The level of detail is good for what is there, but a longer treatment would have allowed for more, particularly of the personalities and backgrounds of the other historical figures involved, many of whom appear here with only the briefest mentions or sketches. Another problem is when Fest engages in speculations as to Hitler's motivations for the things he did - a worthy subject but one that should've been handled in a seperate book. Here they are a digression and due to the short length Fest can't devote enough pages to them to convincingly make his case.All in all however, Inside Hitler's Bunker is a decent book and recommended for anyone who wants a general overview of what happened in those final days."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Inside Hitler's Bunker is a good introduction to the final days of the Second World War from the Nazi perspective - a horrific denoument to a great crisis in world history as Hitler and his cohorts, realising defeat was inveitable, still pursued a grand Wagnerian ending until the last. Berlin was in ruins, thousands were dying by the day, the Red Army were marauding in from the East. And Hitler, a 'cake gobbling wreck', shattered by events, bloodily ended it all along with his wife.This is a short, journalistic history, mainly from secondary sources, with a good deal of speculative rumination. It is not a deep scholarly book. It will appeal as an introduction to the topic, interspersed with some interesting pictures of the war ravaged Berlin, and inside the Bunker itself."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"This book is indeed a brief, highly readable rendering of an oft recounted story, the period from April 16, 1945, the opening of the Soviet offensive against Berlin, to May 2, the call by General Helmuth Weidling for Berlin's defenders to capitulate to the Soviets (with a brief nod to the general surrender on May 8).The book's brevity is apparently the reason why quite a few readers don't like it. That's somewhat understandable (and it may be true, as some reviewers complain, that the point of this book was to exploit Hitler mania and make a \\"quick buck\\"?). Nevertheless, it was an excellent read. This was not because it is a history of the Battle for Berlin (such as Antony Beevor's excellent book on that subject). Likewise, it was not because this book is meant to be an exhaustive treatment or comprehensive recreation of the last ten days or so of Hitler's life. The fact is, there really are not that many new historical facts to be gleaned on this topic anymore and it would be presumptuous to tout a book as some \\"new definitive\\" history of the F&uuml;hrerbunker. Indeed, as Fest himself mentions, one of THE best books on this topic, if not THE best, remains Hugh Trevor-Roper's \\"The Last Days of Hitler,\\" written way back in 1947 (which, incidentally, is also a very brief book). Having said that, Fest does offer some new material here, which did inspire the movie \\"Downfall\\", but less in the sense of major elements of story and more in the sense of brief, evocative vignettes (e.g., the grisly suicide of Ernst Grawitz, vice president of the German Red Cross, who detonated two hand grenades under the dinner table around which his wife and children had assembled).What made the book interesting was precisely what some reviewers found irritating: Fest's apparent digressions from the immediate plot of the \\"downfall story\\" to ponder bigger issues looming in the background. These interpolations are the fascinating parts of this book. For example, Fest muses about this question: when Hitler put the pistol to his head in his final personal act, did he consider himself and his life a \\"failure\\"? At first glance, this seems an odd question to ask about a political leader who had raised his country from defeat, disgrace, and debilitation to become conqueror of Europe and now found himself, only a few years later, huddling 35 feet below the surface of an earth that had been transformed into a barren landscape of rubble and destruction (and not just by his enemies, but by his own orders as well). As Germany's most distinguished historian of Hitler and the Third Reich, Fest has some interesting things to say in answer to this ostensibly quirky question. Another example (and apparent digression) is one Fest first tackled (in English) in his landmark 1974 biography of Hitler: does the phenomenon of Hitler represent \\"consistency\\" in German history, or divergent catastrophe? This is relevant because, depending upon one's perspective on this issue, the cataclysm culminating in April 1945 was (or was not) an inevitable, perhaps even foreseeable event in German history. Again, Fest's lifetime spent studying the Third Reich, his German background, his age (he was 18 when the events in this book transpired), his professional connection with some of the protagonists (e.g., Albert Speer) all make his thoughts on this question, on German history, culture, and national character of singular interest. I do not agree with everything he says (for example, I think he seriously misses the point when he says of Germans at the time of Hitler's rise to power in 1933 that no one \\"could have imagined how far things would go\\"). Nevertheless, his answers are thoughtful, and therefore worth reading and thinking about.True, at the end of this brief book, one might be left \\"wishing for more\\", but in a sense the book can thus be viewed as a pr&eacute;cis of a particular position on the relationship of Hitler to Germans and Germany. In that sense, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Basic facts and figures about the Third Reich are good data, but nothing can really help you understand the Hitler/Nazi phenomenon so well as reading his own words, and the words of the people who made his regime possible - in the volatile environment of Hitler's bunker in April, 1945.Though the book is short, there is a lot to digest in it. I personally didn't feel that it was overly dry, or boring (at all!), particularly in comparison to your average history, but I was a little disappointed in the lack of bibliographical notes.All in all, it's a good place to start, a good book to point you in the direction of the right questions to ask, to lead you to more in-depth information."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Joachim Fest's book is a pregnant reconstruction of Hitler's last days and the end of the Third Reich based on the latest testimonies of the people who were with him in the Berlin bunker.Fest sketches summarily the historical background (the Versailles Treaty, the Weimar Republic), but gives a sharp analysis of Hitler's character: his racism and cynical enforcement of the law of the strongest. The vanquished had to be annihilated or enslaved: 'Apes trample to death all those who don't belong to their community'.Until the end Hitler believed in an alliance change (that Great Britain and the US would turn with him against the bolsheviks).When he saw that the war was lost, he ordered the annihilation of the whole of Germany and its population.Even on the ruins of the Third Reich his lieutenants continued to fight for his succession.This is a short but impressive tale about the madness of power.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"As World War II was coming to an end and the Russian armies were marching towards Berlin, Hitler and some of his most die-hard supporters hid themselves in a secret bunker deep underground. This excellent book lays out the events that were happening inside the bunker and also in the streets outside as the dream of a maniac was coming to an end.As you read you see a Hitler who still has dreams of the Americans and Russians turning against each other and Hitler coming in as the cavalry to aid the US. The bunker was a fertile playground for pipedreams of still being able to win the war even as the cement was falling from the ceilings as bombs struck overhead. It made me think of the Iraqi press officer in the recent war as Americans were invading the country saying that all the Americans had been kicked out and defeated.The portrait of Hitler that emerges is the mentality of a gang leader. He wasn't a visionary. He wanted to kill, loot, and pillage. The world was nothing more than a theater of death to him. He refused to almost the end to surrender, instead bringing needless destruction and death to his people. It seemed that he resented the German people in a way simply because they were gullible enough to do everything he said. My god, where was a voice of reason in the Germany of that era? To me, it seems as though it was a terrorist state.Another disturbing aspect of it was the devotion of his followers and the idealism of the Nazi way of life. For example, Magda Goebbels, on realizing the end of the war, became so depressed that she killed all her children and then committed suicide along with her husband. These people really thought they were mideval knights, holding up some code of chivalry and social codes while they were killing millions of Jews, Russians, and Americans. It almost felt good to read about the end of this horrible state and the absurdity as the people around Hitler struggled amongst themselves to be his successor like there was a future for the Nazi party."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"This book will never make you feel the sensation of impending doom that you testify while watching the recent German movie based in this book. The book is very short, it's has no intention of going deep into every character's psyche. It's not a bad book at all, but it's uninteresting."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Joachim Fest is the author of one of the best books about Hitler that I have read, so I was quite interested in obtaining this new work when its publication was announced. Granted, it's quite short (only 170-some pages), but it does pack great detail, a lot of it new to me. The happenings in the Fuehrerbunker are, in general, fairly well known, but this book, despite its shortness, fleshes them out, and gives great life to all of the characters within the last hiding place of the Reich. As with any good book on a historical subject, the reader will learn something new, and that is my main criteria when I read a history book. This one satisfies on that score, and intersperced with the main story are other chapters discussing Hitler's psyche and theories on war and occupying other countries. There is a sort of conclusion concerning his impact on the world, but I think we all know what that impact is, given that most of us have lived through the subsequent post-war years. All in all, this is a book well work reading, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Well researched and written. The author does a good job of bringing together facts and details from a huge list of resources and includes citing and discussing contradictory information. But it seemed short and I found myself referring to the bibliography for more information. However, I would definitely recommend it, especially if this is the first book about the bunker or the \\"last days\\" you've read."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"The author explains how difficult it is to find a single volume that dispels the many myths surrounding Hitler's (and the Third Reich's) final days in April/May 1945 and how, frankly, his book is one of the first to separate fact from fiction as best as possible. Fest compiles the book nicely, adding a chapter of personal viewpoints and sociological-styled interpretation for every chapter of cold, hard facts and day-to-day status updates on where the Soviets were, where the Wehrmacht was, and when and how they fought. But while his book is a great overview of the subject matter, I would recommend that the reader have a basic understanding of the timeline of the end of the war in Europe. If you're reading those elements for the first time, coupled with the more in-depth reporting by the author, it may prove to be too much for some to digest. For those who can read a book that isn't intended for a less intelligent mass audience, this one gives particular insight as to how the greatest war the world has ever known, and more specifically the scorched-earth policy of a man intent on world domination, impacted the German population in ways Westerners didn't understand for decades."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"James O'Donnell's \\"Bunker\\" is the authoritative history of the Fuhrerbunker. Even Mr. Fest acknowledges that in his Bibliography notes. \\"Inside Hitler's Bunker\\" is cursory, superficial and unoriginal and it escapes me that there can be any reason this book was written except to make a quick buck off of unwary readers. It's a joke. Avoid it at all costs."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"I found this very brief book to be extremely disappointing. I had bought it because the movie \\"DOWNFALL\\" is supposably based on it but after reading the book I find this hard to believe. Much is it is spent discussing the exploits of the Red Army, moralizing about the Nazis, or psychoanalyzing Hitler rather than discussing the subject at hand - a history of the bunker and its participants, none of whom you learn much about in this tiny, often contradictory book. With most of the original participants now dead and not available for interview, the author relies on previously published accounts of the bunker but, strangely, completely ignores the definitive work on Hitler's bunker, James P. O'Donnell's \\"THE BUNKER\\", a vastly superior book I highly recommend.Strangely, photos in this book in this book are mostly of Soviets (!) rather than bunker survivors. The book has no footnotes and many of the author's accounts are contradictory and confusing, which he himself admits, apparently because he was unable to do any first hand research (as James P. O'Donnell had done thirty years ago when he interviewed all the bunker survivors). Many issues Fest found confusing or unexplainable actually had been resolved by O'Donnell (who had gone through the trouble of doing his own research) thirty years ago and Fest could have enlightened his readers if he had read a copy of \\"THE BUNKER\\" before writing his own tiny essay on the subject.The bottom line is to forget this book and find a copy of James P. O'Donnell's \\"THE BUNKER\\" if you want to learn about what went on in Hitler's bunker. The book isn't perfect, but is the best so far on the subject and the author did his homework - unlike Fest."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"While not as thorough as Anton Joachimstahler's or James P. O'Donnell's works on Hitler's last days, Fest provides a good introduction to the last month of Hitler and Nazi Germany's lives. The book somewhat bounces around between Hitler, the Soviet onslaught, and conditions in Berlin, but Fest does a pretty good job of balancing these and writing a readable book. Again, not the most detailed of accounts, but a good intro."},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Despite perhaps being \\"old hat\\" history for those long familiar with the events which took place in Hitler's bunker as WWII drew to a close, Joachim Fest's \\"Inside Hitler's Bunker\\", is, for those of us new to this subject, an excellent introduction to the claustrophobia, paranoia and rampant stupidity which pervaded Hitler's final residence. It is, additionally, the book upon which the recent Oscar-nominated (Best Foreign Film) \\"Downfall\\" with Bruno Ganz (as Hitler) was based.Mr. Fest's narrative races along like a well-tuned Aston Martin - indeed, the book almost reads like a page-turning best-selling novel - and sweeps the reader up in heartbreaking and senseless death and madness. I've since gone on to read other works by Mr. Fest and have been well-pleased. I highly recommend this one, no matter WHAT you know about Adolf Hitler's final days and hours. -"},{"Title":"Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich","review":"Please do not waste your time nor your money on this book. There are far better ones available if you wish to learn about Hitler's last days in the bunker. There is no new information here. And it is rather \\"skimpy\\" at that. Check out James P.

This one being a compilation of the last days in the Berlin F&uuml;hrerbunker. It is not as detailed as several other books on this subject. For example, he covers the breakout from the Bunker in only two pages worth of writing.The author, Fest, does not include a \\"notes\\" chapter, nor footnotes for page sources. The author states it is \\"...because of the hopeless confusion...\\" of the statements witnesses have given over the years. I believe he has only added to the problem by neither going into more detail as to overall events, nor noting his sources at the time events are discussed (or views expressed). The author engages in too much surmise of \\"fringe theories\\" as to Hitler's death. Further, the chapter, \\"The Will to Destroy\\", has too much personal political commentary by the author.Mr. Fest does not mention as sources the Russian material that began to come to light in the mid-1990's, starting with \\"The Death of Hitler\\" by Petrova and Watson who gained access to \\"Operation Myth\\" files (but not the final dossier). It was followed by the book \\"Hitler's Death: Russia's Last Great Secret from the Files of the KGB\\" which is a biased compilation of the incomplete early SMERSH (Military Counter-Espionage Dept.) investigation as to Hitler's death. It came out in 2005, right before \\"The Hitler Book\\" (with its own bias Soviet viewpoints) which was put together from the dossier from the subsequent secret investigation (Operation Myth) by the Soviet NKVD (later known as the MVD, the forerunner of the KGB). The compiled, completed dossier put together for Stalin (started in February 1946 and received by Stalin on December 30, 1949).In the end, I recommend \\"The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, the Evidence, the Truth\\" by Anton Joachimsthaler for a more objective, detailed compilation on the subject of Hitler's last days. The book offers a careful re-examination of the evidence, myths and inaccuracies. It includes testimony given at West German Federal Court that lasted from 1952 to 1956 as to Hitler's death. It further has detailed footnotes for page sources. I also recommend, \\"Soldiers of the Leibstandarte\\" by Thomas Fischer (J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc., 2008) for an objective biography on Mohnke and details of his last days in the Bunker and Berlin."},{"Title":"The Prophet Jonah","review":"I have found the commentary helpful.

Throw in locations in San Francisco, Amsterdam, Paris and Africa, and you get globe-trotting action with plot twists that keep you guessing until the end.I enjoyed &quot;Diamond Lies&quot; and found the map legend to be an interesting device in the role it played with John Erickson's quest to find his one true love. The novel was fast-paced and well-written, and the characters were multi-dimensional, even the villains Barzan and Moto. The subplots were effective as well, involving the lives of the elder Erickson's, and the environmental message that gave multiple sides of the issue.There was some temporal weirdness with the prologue, which bothered me. Also, the Teri Clark character came across as insecure and high maintenance, and somewhat irritating. I would have liked more physical description of the characters. I also wanted more sensual atmosphere of the various locations, especially in the Africa section.There were a number of sequences that were stunning, including a key action scene involving a river, wildebeests, and range rovers.

Johann Sorenson paints a vivid picture inside a strong plot worth reading by the Romancing the Stone crowd.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Diamond Lies","review":"This is a great story and adventure. Mr. Sorenson does a fine job of keeping you guessing and on the edge of your seat. His characters are real, all too real in the case of the bad guy Barzan. The landscapes are vivid and easy to visualize. The story is timely and the adventure timeless. An easy read that will take you on the journey as it unfolds."},{"Title":"Diamond Lies","review":"WOW! this is an GREAT book! When I started to read it I didn't want to put it down... I even came into work after I had started it and told my boss I wanted to stay home to finish it because I wanted to know what was going to happen next...

I would recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Diamond Lies","review":"The thrill of watching a new romance take shape tingles the spine with the way the author walks you through those romantic emotions that give you euphoria.The sights and sounds of San Francisco, are so real you can taste the foggy nights on your tounge. The descriptions of the San Frnaciso Bay and the sights described are so perfect, you feel you are in the setting itself. If I ever get to the Serengeti, I will know what to look for.There is here, besides a love story, a Treasure Map, that leads the reader across continents. There are dangerous animals, and more dangerous people, to be wary and afraid of. The action scenes are quick and vicious. It makes the hair on your arms stand straight up.The book is so real in it's feeling and narrative of the characters, that one feels the joy and pain and misgivings of each character portrayed.Johann Sorenson, the Author, has a real skill with humor, and you find yourself laughing out loud at the pundits, jokes, wittisims, and self mocking remarks. It works quite well on paper. One has to remind one's self that &quot;it is a work of fiction&quot;.I loved this book and recommend it highly. I can hardly wait for the Author's next release."},{"Title":"Diamond Lies","review":"This book kept me intrigued from cover to cover! It's got a little bit of everything, from adventure to romance.

She said reading it gave her peace of mind while she felt closer to God. The prayers are beautifully written. I highly highly recommend this book to anyone who is facing major changes in life, death, divorce, health crisis, middle age crisis or job loss. I was a big fan of the \\"Artist's Way\\" by Julia before, but now I am eternally grateful to her book for comforting my dear friend in a way I couldn't do myself. The best money I ever spent on a book!!!"},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"This book was one of the top selling religious books in 2004.Why is it called \\"Answered Prayer\\"? Let us say that you are dealing with any of a number of personal challenges, and in the middle of them, you are hoping to hear some word from the Lord. Perhaps you are worried about diminished income, or you are wondering if you are a loveable person. You may have concerns about life being dull and humorless. You are weary. You are afraid to reach out to someone in friendship. You are afraid to take the risk of trusting another. Cameron addresses these and many more concerns, in her book.The book is like a journal of prayer, but most prayer journals record the voice of the one who prays. Not this book. Instead of prayers that are addressed to God, these prayers are presented as responses to the one who prays, in other words, as if one is hearing back, from God. It sounds like this: \\"I am the peace that passes understanding.\\" Or, \\"Open the door just a foothold. I can work with you as you are. You are not the first disillusioned one I have encountered.\\" (Page 149).Every chapter is a prayer. Every prayer is deeply steeped in Scripture. You will find these prayers to be in accord with God's many promises we find there. These \\"love letters from the Divine\\" allow us to hear what God longs to say to us, when we find ourselves in deep and troubled waters."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"I just love this book. It's for anyone who practices no particular \\"religion\\". The prayers are simple, in every day language, easily understood like God is speaking right to me. I find it inspiring every day and look forward to reading one prayer per day. None are more than a few paragraphs and all speak straight to the heart."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"My husband and I lost our daughter to stillbirth recently. I didn't feel anger towards God but I felt like I lost a trust with Him that I'd had before. I found this book and as I read it I cried and it changed my life. It bridged the gap and restored the trust that I had in God. I believe God gave Julia Cameron the words that He knew I'd need following this tragedy. I have since tried to put a copy of this book in the hands of everyone that I love to help them through any hard times they might face in life. It has been such a blessing to me."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"This book is simple, yet meaningful and worthy of contemplation or meditation. I have given this book as a gift to about 20 people and every person has called me to tell me how much they love the book and the thoughtfulness to give something that is a little different than flowers or chocolate to someone going through another phase in their life.There is also something I think about when I hit a spiritual roadblock."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"In an age where religions and people debate endlessly on which religion is right, who's in God's grace, etc, its comforting to find a book like this, which does not take sides. Rather, it speaks to everyone, no matter who you are, what your faith, or where you live.The book is made up of lots of small little conversations, where God reassures you about issues of fear, lonliness, loss, etc. In a way, you could call this book \\"God for dummies\\", because it shows you in simple, everyday language, what God is. It simply is about a God who loves and cares about you, who wants to comfort and reassure you.The writting style is simple and beautiful. I do believe, in my own personal opinion, that God was working through Mrs. Cameron, speaking words of comfort and reassurance.The overall message of this book is, \\"I love and care about you. Let me into your life, and I can help you make it great. I will always be there for you, no matter how hard things get, for I am love, and that is all I have for you.\\" I don't see how anyone can miss the message here. God is love. God loves you for who you are, no matter what you believe.Perhaps this quote can say it better. \\"For me, you are never seperate, never small. I made this world as my gift to you. It is my joy when you enjoy it, when you feel safe and secure. This is my intention for you always. Take comfort in me as your creator and your protector. you are my own.\\" (Pg 46).I highly recommend this book to everyone. It can cure any bad feelings i'm feeling when I'm reading it, and it always makes me feel better, because in my heart, I know that it's messages are true."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"This is an incredible book. I don't buy the whole \\"religion\\" thing myself, but do try to connect with something bigger on a semi-frequent basis. There's no mention of any particular denomination, faith, or creed, just God, or Higher Power, or Great Spirit, talking in ways you wish would explain stuff. It's very loving, and understanding, and patient, and comforting. I'm still wary of anything smacking of dogma or moralism, but this was anything but. Perfect for stuck people, depressed people, and people who claim not to need the big \\"G\\", but still want some reassurance alone at night. Some of the \\"shepherd\\" refrences could have been dropped, though."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"When I ordered this book I thought it was a catalog of \\"I prayed for this and was answered like that,\\" but it is not. It is written as if God is talking to you, the reader, and expressing His thoughts, concerns, feelings, and love about you, and describing Himself in the process. If you were raised in the kind of church that depicted God as an angry, impossible, pyromaniac, this book just might heal those corrupt files in your heart, head and soul. It is exquisitely beautiful. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Answered Prayers","review":"Beautiful, lyrical, and light dancing on the heart.

The project was about the Philosophies found in Shakespeare's Sonnets. Edmondson's book was very helpful. Every sonnet is diagrammed through a chart so you know which theme applies to each sonnet. This was extremely important because I was studying the \\"young patron\\" and \\"dark lady\\" sonnets. There are even charts which map the sonnets that are addressed to male and female companions. The language Edmondson uses is easy to read and follow and very quotable. I was glad to have this book as a reference during my project on the sonnets. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has studied or wants a companion to Shakespeare's sonnets."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Oxford Shakespeare Topics)","review":"An impressively wide-ranging and rounded survey of Shakespeare's sonnets, this guide doesn't confine itself to purely academic routines. Its last two sections, for example, are on writing that has been inspired by the poems and on CD and video recordings of them. (And as Simon Callow might tell you, the authors don't pull any punches when they find something amiss - his recording gives 'the overall effect of an elocutionary exercise'. Ouch!) Edmonson and Wells are refreshingly up-to-date on all things sonnet-related: about American appropriations of the poems in modern theatre, for instance, and about the difference made by experiencing the sonnets on CD as opposed to audio cassette, with the former, they suggest, more likely to encourage hopping around within the sequence (or 'collection', their preferred term).But for me - as probably for most potential readers, including students - the main value of the book lies in its core, in which the sonnets' form, artistry, themes and theatricality are dealt with. It explores the poems' variety of structures and effects, provides exemplars of close reading, analyses links between sonnets, and provides an illuminating series of parallels with Shakespearean drama. Further sections evaluate the work of critics and editors (chiefly Kerrigan, Duncan-Jones and Burrow). But although the poems' homoeroticism has recently been explored in considerable detail, the name of Joseph Pequigney is conspicuously absent, as indeed is that of Bruce Smith, and those sections of the book that deal with the sexuality of poems and poet would have been strengthened by a wider discussion that included their views.This is a book, however, that is thorough and elegantly written. It is one that also tries to do justice to the sonnets' complexity and to the infinite plurality of response to them, and it might be worth quoting its closing sentence in full: 'If we think we have exhausted their inexhaustibility, it is we ourselves who are exhausted; if we think we have finished reading them, then it is time we turned to other writers to unfinish them for us.' Turning to Edmonson and Wells in the first instance, however, would be an informed choice."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Oxford Shakespeare Topics)","review":"The CONTENTS of the book following the Preface:PART I1.

The Critical Reputation of the Sonnets11. The Sonnets and Later Writers12. The Sonnets in PerformanceThe editors affirm that the Sonnets are a collection rather than a sequence -- they do not tell a story. Part of their wonder is their mystique: we do not know if they express attitudes or episodes from the poet's personal history, we do not understand the dedication or to whom it is addressed or indeed who devised it. We do not understand if their order is that of the poet who wished to see them published, or if their author wished them published at all. We will never know these things, nor do they matter. The Sonnets are a wonder of the world because of their art and their dramatics. As poems, as theatre, they are unique. This excellent book examines all aspects of the sonnets and their story, their history, their artistry. It is a book I shall return to again and again, for information, for pleasure."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Oxford Shakespeare Topics)","review":"You might be fooled by the title. This is an interesting scholarly look at Shakespeare's sonnets, as the title makes clear. I found this book while reading an article that cited it. What led me to the text was a claim that some sonnet passages were in some plays, and I wanted to find out where these passages were. Unfortunately, that bit was pretty speculative and not well supported. There were a lot of \\"this reads the way passage X in Romeo and Juliet reads\\" and that sort of thing. I expected verbatim, or near verbatim passages. Guess I showed my ignorance on that on, but that's the only gripe.

The choice fell on SOAP. Since our system is Java-based, we need to use Java SOAP.The interesting point is that it took us just 2 weeks to come up with a Python prototype program which we continuously use to measure up the Java SOAP implementation which ends up taking us months to complete.This shows just how up-to-date the Python community is in keeping up with new technologies (those that have potentials).So why Python is not included in the selection of the language in this book is beyond me.NOTE: For readers who ask &quot;Python-what??&quot;: Python is a typeless language that is more readable than Visual Basic but as versatile as Perl."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"I was so keen to learn from this book, but no matter how hard I tried it had too much nonsense to be readable or usable."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"This book was a disappointment. I got thrown into an XML/SOAP project and had to get up to speed in short order. After struggling on my own for a while I bought this book hoping it would have lots of meat on actually using SOAP::Lite, but it had pretty thin coverage.I did like the big-picture overview of the various technologies, but it was not very helpful in writing an actual SOAP client to talk to a third party's SOAP server. Considering that the author of SOAP::Lite also wrote this book, it seems to me that there could have been a whole chapter on SOAP::Lite from the client view.This will stay on my shelf as a reference, but for getting up to speed rapidly on actually writing a SOAP client, it was a bust."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"I usually give preference to O'Reilly's books when looking to purchase a book on a certain programming technology. O'Reilly is generally ahead of the pack in terms of writing style, author's reputation, and knowledge of the subject. Unfortunately, I have little to no confidence in the knowledge of the authors in this book just from reading and trying out the introductory examples on SOAP::Lite in PERL. It starts off with the trivial &quot;Hello World&quot; example of writing a SOAP server and a client. The authors didn't even get this one right! Already threre are errata submitted for this example on the oreilly.com site. I couldn't believe it!

Unfortunately it shows how hard is to get functionality of a SOAP app fromthree differnt languages. It is a messy affair. One gets excited at the begining to see simple Perl implementations but then it starts with the Java mess and that other language... There are too many XML snippets thrown around without a careful presentation of the big picture. People who write on SOAP get all excited about the XML representation of the protol and forget completely that it is the programing API that counts: XML is not for human consumtion unless it is less than 10 lines long!!!!The UDDI and WSDL stuff, forget it. It is easier to go and fetch examples from the web.I hope the authors reconsider their approach and produce a reallyreally revised second edition including better overview the protocol (less on long XML listings) and sections on when does it make sense to use SOAP.

I was hoping that the O'Reilly version of programming with SOAP would be usable, but unfortunately, it's not.There is only 174 pages of real information, and a lot is code. There is 70 pages of appendices, which is roughly 1/4 of the book. Any topics are so vaguely described that you still don't understand anything about programming with SOAP.I got this book because it deals with Apache SOAP, something that I'm personally interested in, however a lot of the published stuff is almost taken straight from the documentation. Reading Apache's sparse documentation and going through their examples is probably a much better value that trying to go through this book.The book also tries to deal with Perl, SOAP, and .NET programming. So for every example, he reiterates the same sample in 3 different forms, which is a waste of space. Because he splits his efforts amongst these three languages, his information is spread extremely thin.There's not a lot of information that is given in this book, and I would avoid is entirely. Basically, it's [not worth it]."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"Hi I'm the one who wants to learn how to build cool apps with SOAP. To be honest, this book is not that practical. It certainly explains the overview, but in terms of developing a real application, I don't think this is useful.It should have focused on only 1.) what is SOAP, 2.) how it works 3.) how to write code.It tries to cover more broad, vague topic Web Services, which is more or less overview, as it is not ready for prime time.How to use SOAP API should be not that difficult to understand, but what each SOAP envelope's xml tag syntax means are most important to me. It's so complex and this book doesn't explain clearly, which makes this book less valuable.Looking forward to next improved edition."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"What can I say, not worth of buying.Too short samples that were written in too many languages.Architectual overview for Web Services was too short too.Waiting for better book."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"If your pretty new at SOAP, and if you need an overview, then this is the book you want.If you don't care about interoperability, and you just want a book on SOAP within a particular environment (say Java), then this is not the book you want.If you need a reference guide, then you don't need this book."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","review":"This book is a nice introduction to SOAP.

Nowhere is this sentiment perhaps more true than in the world of drugs and crime. Often the real criminals in many areas of crime are protected while their victims are hunted. This prevails not only in the west but also in the east. For instance, looking through glossy travel magazines about exotic destinations in S.E. Asia, one can see the ostentatious red line on the pages (comparable with the government health warning that accompanies a cigarette adveryisement). These read 'The traficking in drugs carries the death penaty'. It seems that the main purpose of such an ad for these countries (who do not print similar warnings against other crimes from which they make money such as child pornography etc.) is just to ingratiate themselves with western governments, especailly if they manage to make an 'example' of the odd user (not dealer).I am a linguist and folklorist and I have no contacts whatsoever with anyone taking drugs. So why did I buy this book? There are two main reasons: the first is that I feel human compassion for the victims of this scourge and the second reason is that I love learning new words and phrases, as I shall explain below in my review.For a start, it must be clarified that this book is NOT intended for the drug pushers or dealers (they will already be familiar with most of these terms). As the author explains in the blurb, the purpose of this book is to provide help for parents of drug users and for police officers. These are two heroic categories of people who in thier different ways try to help the addict and it is of paramount importance that they are both well-informed about drugs in order to carry out thios help effectively. I can also think of other cateories of readers who could benefit from reading this book. Firstly ,a counsellor such as the sensitive person who wrote the previous review. The main person , however, to whom this book should be given is the potential victim. These days, just going to an innocent party, one without wanting to, could end up a victim (e.g. if some unscrupulous person laces their drink etc.). It is therefore handy to know, when offered a drink, for instance, to understand what some creep means if they smile in a 'friendly' way when pouring a drink and ask the vulnerable guest if they want some 'Uncle Elmer' in it (i.e. ecstasy) or 'Uncle Sid' (LSD). Or perhaps someone is waiting to be served a drink while she hears the host talking in his lingo about him preparing this drink to 'babysit' (i.e guide someone through their first drug experience). Now, thanks to this dictionary, the drug talk is no loinger a hidden form of slang to which the uninitiated are excluded (similar to the way in which the Cockney 'spivs' used the rhyming slang if they did not want to be understood). I am also impressed by the fact that 10% of the proceeds from this book help towards the environment ( for reforestation) and for children's education).As I have previoulsy mentioned, my main reason for purchasing this title was to acquire another tool for my research as a linguist and folklorist. Talking of folk customs, it is interesting that several of the entries shoul use expressions borrowed from rites of passage. In a very subtle way the use of drugs is thus parallelled with a relationship/getting married. First there is the so-called 'honeymoon' period (pleasant as the name must suggest when the user feels in control and actually seems to enjoy his/her initial acquaintance with the drug - that was invariably given free as a treat). Indeed, one entry referes to the addiction as a 'love affair' and there is even a similar entry on 'wedding bells'. Yet, as with an unripe persimon (which leaves a hateful taste in the mouth and sting s the tongue), these phaese are followed by the 'bag bride' (prostitute - showing how the victim has to reach the lowest level in order to pay for the next fix).Whaty is so dangerous is that such deadly substances are given such pleasant names. For instance, we have the euphemisms like 'red cross' (marijuana) and 'white cross' (methamphetamine). Moreover, on the subject of folklore, there are also apparently harmless names like 'pixies' (amphetamine), 'troll' (LSD and ecstasy), 'ghost' (LSD) and 'zombie' (PCP). There are also countless drugs that contain the word 'dragon' (LSD- also called 'Chinese Dragons'), etc.Another pleasant aspect of the nomenclature is that occasionally drugs are given the names of pop songs (or perhaps vice versa). Hence we have 'Lucy in the Sky of Diamonds' said to represent LSD (as do the terms 'Strawberry fields' and 'Mellow yellow') whereas the 'yellow submarine' referes to marijuana.This dictionary contains 3,000 entries ranging from 'A'( LSD) to 'Zulu' (bogus crack). Indeed, many entries pertain to mixed drugs - something that is most dangerous. From what I have heard, an addict must be weaned off by taking reduced doses of the pure drug form (or a milder substiutute) to which he/she is addicted and not given cheaper forms that are adulterated with all kinds of harmful substances - just so the dealer can make his drug go round more and make more money. The dictionary is also useful , then, in that it gives information about such deadly compounds which the addict should beware of and avoid. One such mixture is 'dragon rock' (heroin and crack). Another term to beware of is a 'bad bundle' (inferior quality heroin - no doubt inferior as it has been tampered with). Moreover, a 'drank' is a cigarette or marijuana laced with PCP. On the subject of mixed drugs, there are also new portmanteau terms coined in the last couple of decades . e.g. 'dopium' (dope+ opium) and 'secstasy' (viagra + ecstasy).Many terms pertain to mesurements or slang expressions for money. For example, 'HO' is half an ounce of marijuana, a 'dime' is ten dollars of crack, a 'deuce' is two dollars of any drug and a 'brick' is a kilo of marijuana. Some entries feature colours : 'black pearl' (heroin), 'orange haze' (LSD), 'Yellow bullets' (depressants), 'red rock' (heroin), 'blue mist'(LSD), 'green magic' (marijuana) and 'brown sugar' (heroin). Other entries are taken by analogy with animals. For instance, 'teddy bears' refers to LSD and so is 'hawk' while 'red eagle' is heroin and so is 'tiger'.Several entries are eponymous. For instance, a 'Jeffereson airplane' is a used match to hold a marijuana joint and a 'Munro' (no doubt by the tragic allusion to the 1950's actress) means narcotics. Many entries are toponymous or racial/racist. The poor Mexicans have their share with phrases like\\"'fly Mexican airways' (smoke marijuana), 'Acupulco gold' (marijuana) as is 'Zacateca's purple' whereas 'Mexican horse' is heroin. Other ethnic phrases include 'Afghan black' and 'Angola' (both meaning marijuana), 'black Russian' (hashish), 'Bolivian marching powder' (cocaine) and 'Apache' (fentanyl).At the beginning of the dictionary there is an informative description of the main drugs. The terms in the book are taken from a wide variety of American slang forms such as black slang and Spanish words used by Hispanics, yet British slang terms are not represented. There are even new portmanteau terms like 'dopium' (dope + opium) and 'secstasy' (viagra + ecstasy). Indeed what is significant about this book is that it reflects the MODERN slang of today. Hence there are even terms like 'Twin towers' and 'WTC' for heroin (terms obviously coined after the tragedy of 11th September). In the case of the latter entry , the author does not explain that the abbreviation stands for the World Trade Center (a point not necessarily obvious to non-Americans). Indeed, one slight weakness (but for most readers probably an advantage) is that while the entries are all clear and concise they are not etymlogical. Another instance is the term 'thirteen' which means marijuana. The reason for this is that 'M' is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet. However, the author's simple and succinct style may well be more effective than a ddictionary with longer entries.In order to be able to deal with any problem one must first try to understand that problem. This book certainly succeeds in imparting a very thorough understanding of this subject and thus it is an important tool that can be used to help many people.P.S. After going unnoticed for several months without any readers'endoresment or disagreement, this review has suddenly received no less than 16 negative acknowledgements. This form of marking system seems highly dubious in the extreme and I very much doubt whether this response is from 16 (or even two) persons. Wealthy customers could easily have more than one Amazon account. It is also possible that the priveleged and affluent tend to judge the victims of the evil scourge of drugs rather than the scourge itself. People whose life is in ruins through drug abuse need help not condemnation. This is the most christian attitude."},{"Title":"The Complete Drug Slang Dictionary","review":"I have to say that this is by far one of the best books I have read on drug paraphenilia slang, its incredible how this person has comprised the book from begginning to end and whats more amazing is the amount of research that took in order to comprise this masterful book.

The real purpose for these introductory tapes is determining whether the Pimsleur method is going to work for you -- before dropping a couple hundred dollars on the Comprehensive volumes. Certainly, over the course of the four tapes you'll get some basic vocabulary, the ability to construct a few simple sentences, and good practice on pronunciation.I give these tapes five stars because 1) I had fun going through them, 2) I love the fact and the challenge that the course is purely audio, 3) I got to jump start my mainly book-learned and non-conversational Chinese, 4) and they confirmed that the Pimsler method works for me.If you already know that you like the Pimsleur method, then go ahead and get the Comprehensive I set -- which contains these four tapes."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin)","review":"This would be great for someone just going on a short trip to china; a few key phrases that should get you around fairly well.

I would recommend the Pimsleur method for anyone going abroad with only a little time to learn the language."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin)","review":"This is not a language course but it is an easy and pleasant way to become acquainted with the language.

You don't get any written material but just listen to the recording. It is easy but thorough. It gives you enough to get started. I wanted a little Chinese as I will be working in China and Singapore next year and it has given me a start. If I decide I want to learn the language seriously I will probably buy a different program.This program has done exactly what I wanted."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin)","review":"Basically I do not believe in learning to speak a language without learning to read it at the same time. You will acquire knowledge of the principles of Mandarin pronunciation and some syntax. The course is very repetitive and the amount of vocabulary you will learn is very limited. The repetition is part of the Pimsleur method of memory training, absorption and immersion. Having completed the course, I now feel somewhat familiar with Mandarin pronunciation and at ease with it. But you will only acquire about two or three dozen sentences of polite conversation between an American Gentleman and a Chinese woman he meets."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin)","review":"This abridged version of the full Pimsler series has been a wonderful introduction to Madarin for me. I find that the repetition and the emphasis on sound and tone of the tapes to be especially helpful.However, at least in this abridged version, there is no accompanying text that presents the words and sentences you are learning through the tapes. Such a text, even with a romanized version of the words, would be helpful. To compensate, I have been relying heavily on the introductory section of: Reading and Writing Chinese : A Guide to the Chinese Writing System by William McNaughton and Li Ying, which goes into pronunciation in extensive detail.

(Eight Audio Lessons on 4 Cassettes). Simon &amp; Schuster Audio, 2001. ISBN 07435-0771-1.Every country in the world is agreed that a knowledge of foreign languages is important. Every year the world devotes an enormous amount of time, energy, and money to trying to teach its young people to understand and speak some foreign language or other.In the West, millions of high school and college students are busy desperately trying to learn French, German, and Spanish; in China and Japan they are undergoing the torture of English courses. But despite the intense effort and enormous resources that are devoted to these studies, the results, as everyone knows, are pitiful.After years of study, students might be able to read simple passages in a foreign language, but usually won't be able to say much beyond such things as - &quot;Good morning. How are you?&quot; - and they will be completely baffled when hearing foreigners speak.I've often wondered why no-one ever seems to ask why the teaching of foreign languages is such a catastrophic failure. Why does it produce so few who become fluent? I've wondered because the answer is painfully obvious, and can be stated very simply :WE LEARN LANGUAGE THROUGH THE EAR, NOT THE EYE; LANGUAGE CANNOT BE LEARNED THROUGH THE EYE.No child ever learned its own language by studying a book and working out exercises. We learn our own language through the ear, first by listening to others and then by participating. That's why we learn it so effortlessly and so well. Reading is a secondary skill that comes much later.If PIMSLEUR is an anagram for SIMPLER U it makes sense, because not only is the PIMSLEUR method SIMPLER for YOU, its also the ONLY method that has any hope of real success. Language is primarly an AURAL-ORAL phenomenon, a matter of listening and speaking. Using these tapes gives you lots of practise in both. Repeated use will bring a basic fluency that will give you the confidence to start interacting with native speakers of Chinese or French or whatever language you are studying. And if you have enough opportunities for that you'll soon be on your way to real fluency.These tapes require application but they do work, and after finishing them you'll almost certainly want to get the Comprehensive Program, because it's not only work but fun. But what a wonderful idea the PIMSLEUR method is! I wonder why no one ever seems to have thought of it before? After all, if you do think about it, it's the only method that makes sense."},{"Title":"Code of the Lifemaker","review":"James Hogan's usually blends solid scientific ideas with action paced stories and &quot;Code of the Lifemaker&quot; is one of his most succesfull achievements. The central character, Karl Zambedorf is highly ingenious and likely to be liked by readers. Around him and his travel to Titan, Hogan builds an attractive plot, using ideas from the evolution theory which he seems to address on a basis of strong conviction. Paradoxically enough, in more recent articles, Hogan has revised his ideas on the topic, revealing a reflective man capable of going back some steps and reconsidering his positions.Of course, there are some things that are less convincing in the novel. The trilled (and recurrent in Hogan's work) theme of a confrontation between science and religion is handled quite superficially and some characters in the \\"wrong\\" side are defintively cartoonish.All in all, an entertaining ride well worth reading. Watch out for the superb prologue and yes...there is a sequel (&quot;The Inmortality Option&quot;).Rating=3.5"},{"Title":"Code of the Lifemaker","review":"I'm surprised at the number of good reviews for this book. The premise is VERY intriguing: humans making contact with a &quot;race&quot; of evolved robots. The intro gives an interesting (if somewhat overwhelming) account of how the robots came to be, but from there on, the book gets pretty flat. It's crammed with cardboard characters, both human and robot. I really looked forward to reading this, but it sure didn't pay off."},{"Title":"Code of the Lifemaker","review":"As stated in other comments, the Prologue is great, it sets the basis for this alien machine life form. Hogan excels at what's considered \`hard core' science fiction, the problem is that he strays from that in this book. The idea of machine life occurring via natural selection through software genomes was written very believably. In the book though, this lifeform becomes in almost every way the machine equivalent to humans and thus strains the credibility of the story. Hogan does this purposely though because the story is obviously a political allegory. The machines are in the midst's of their own Renaissance, but the big bad humans oligarchs are there to exploit them. It's ironic, in the book Hogan complains, in what sounds personally, about young engineers who have opinions on how they can change the world for the better in one swoop, yet Hogan does that himself in the novel. That's what drives this book from a great idea with potential to a somewhat preachy, so-so political commentary. I'd give it 2-1/2 stars. However Hogan's Inherit The Stars is a superb book which I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Code of the Lifemaker","review":"This book was not even worth the paper it was written on.

I found it very good. I liked the robot dialogue. I found myself enjoying the robot characters, and the primitive culture they had. The feelings of robots evolving over millions of years is neat, as is the origin of the robots on Titan. There seemed to be a lot of negative reviews of this book, with the beginning being all they liked. I liked the very beginning too, but most of the rest of the book did not let me down.

Knowing that I'd previously enjoyed Hogan's Sci-Fi (more than many other authors in the genre), I kept going and going. Eventually, after perhaps a third of the way in, it became hard to put down. From that point on the book becaume a quick and enjoyable read.There's a few theme's of the book. One is that a self replicating and administered alien machine infrastructure could, over time, develop in a biological fashion, and eventually acquire life like properties and even sentience. Another is that there would likely be an attempt by humanity to exploit a local sentient race and technologies if discovered, repeating once again the historical story of our conqueror culture. Both themes were played out in a typical Hogan-like believable way that was a pleasure to read. There is a lot one could potentially reflect on from this story, the science and cultural aspects of the story, and what the nature of life and sentience is.The book ends very optimistically, with everything working out just perfectly in the end. An ending with a few more loose ends hanging around, ragged and still in need of repair, would probably have made the story more believable and realistic. But, hey, it is fiction after all."},{"Title":"A Poverty of Reason: Sustainable Development and Economic Growth","review":"Though it is unorthodox to do so, I believe I need to respond to Mr. Balfour's review because he appears to misunderstand the purpose of Prof. Beckerman's book as well as the substance of the environmental idea that Beckerman is challenging.Beckerman is criticizing the notion of &quot;sustainability&quot; -- that the planet's development rate cannot be sustained in the future because resources will not be extractable at a rate that would keep up with future demand. Hence, sustainability isn't an aesthetic argument, but an economic one. Balfour's criticism that Beckerman does not consider the aesthetic arguments for environmentalism is misplaced because that is not Beckerman's project. Balfour's comments thus are akin to criticizing a military history book on Napoleonic tactics for not discussing the romance between Napoleon and Josephine.For people intrigued with the arguments concerning sustainability, Beckerman's book is a must-read. It offers short but very thoughtful examinations of several apparently problematic assumptions that lie at the heart of the sustainability philosophy. The sustainability notion emerged about two decades ago when environmentalists were forced to retreat from their &quot;finite resources&quot; argument (i.e., the world will run out of resource X) because, as highlighted by the famous Julian Simon-Paul Weyrich bet, the idea that the planet would simply &quot;run out&quot; became too untenable for all but the most radical environmentalists to hold. The more thoughtful environmentalists shifted to the Malthusian/Ricardoian notion that extraction rates will one day be unable to keep pace with consumption -- in part because resource extractors in the future will constrict supply to further drive up prices.Unlike the finite resources argument, the sustainability has good thought behind it. But does that theory hold up? Beckerman offers some pretty good arguments that it does not, and he also points out some very worrisome side-effects of the sustainability philosophy -- side-effects that could produce serious near-future ecological and human disasters.Balfour is correct that we must give serious thought to future generations when we set current resource policies. Unfortunately, he does not appear to realize that his philosophy puts those children at risk, nor does he seem to appreciate that the environmental catastrophes that he laments -- overpopulation, subsistence farming -- occur in the Third World whose ecological ethic he cherishes instead of the First World whose ethic he derides. Fortunately, Beckerman -- as well as his future challengers and their respondents -- will promote a better world for the generations to come."},{"Title":"A Poverty of Reason: Sustainable Development and Economic Growth","review":"Will economic growth deplete the natural resources on which it depends? Are we in danger of running out of energy sources? Will global warming bring widespread devastation on the planet? Does unbridled economic growth threaten the balance of nature?Looking at the evidence on these questions, Oxford University economist Wildred Beckerman finds that many of these fears are unfounded. While billions of people around the world suffer under appalling environmental conditions, such as a lack of clean water and sanitation, these problems are primarily caused by poverty, not unsustainable development.Despite the fact that so many are touting the wisdom of \\"sustainable development\\" as though its meaning and desirability were an established fact, there is no widespread agreement over its meaning, and its desirability is too often not subjected to scientific, economic, and philosophical scrutiny.The author points out in his introduction to the book that support for sustainable development is based on a confusion about its ethical implications and on a flagrant disregard of the relevant factual evidence.The popularity of sustainable development is founded on two indefensible propositions, according to the author:Economic growth will soon come up against the limits of resource availability.Sustainable development represents the moral high ground.It is argued that action is required in order to reduce to \\"sustainable\\" levels the rate at which resources are used, which, Beckerman argues, is an impossible task unless we were to stop using some resources completely. Also, he asserts, the risk to the human race from climate change is greatly exaggerated.Sustainable development's place in the moral high ground is questioned, as there are few coherent reasons to believe that sustainable development is an ethically superior goal.Chapter one focuses on two questions:What exactly does sustainable development mean?What is so good about it?The World Commission on Environment and Development defines the term as \\"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\\" Beckerman contends that this criterios is not very helpful, and for a number of reasons.First, since not every need of the current generation is being met, why should future generations be any different? Furthermore, he reasons that people at different points in time or at different income levels or with different cultural or national backgrounds differ about the importance they attach to different needs.Also, this injunction leaves no room for trade-offs. If it is true that future generations will face serious environmental problems, how many of the needs and wants of the current generation are to be sacrificed in order to help future generations meet their needs? Do we eve know what these needs might be?Another concept of sustainable development relates to the conservation of plant and animal species. What price must we pay to conserve all plant and animal species for posterity? Is this even the natural order of things? Given that approximately 98% of all the species that have ever existed are believed to have become extinct already, how many of us can truly say that we have suffered as a result?As for the moral high ground, the idea that we have a responsibility to maintain the environment exactly as it is today is morally repugnant. Given the large numbers of people who are living in poverty and environmental degradation, we cannot ignore these real human needs in order to save every single one of the several million species of beetle that exist.Chapter two concentrates on finite resources and the prospects for economic growth. Resources are either finite or they are not. If they are, then the only way to ensure that they last forever is to stop using them. But of course, even the most fanatical proponents of sustainability don't go that far, and would reasonably have to admit that the human race will eventually find ways of coping with the changes that take place in he balance between demand and supply of resources.In other words, you can't have it both ways. Either resources are finite in some relevant sense, in which case even zero growth will fail to save us in the long run, or resources are not really finite in any relevant sense, in which case the argument for slowing growth collapses.Actually, the author contends, not only are resources not finite in any relevant sense, but the evidence of all past history, including even the recent past, shows that there have been no trends toward the exhaustion of any resources that matter. History is littered with predictions of imminent resources scarcity that have subsequently been proven false.In 1929, a study concluded that the world's resources of lead cannot meet the anticipated demand. Yet for the rest of the twentieth century, no one worried about a lead shortage. In fact, people have been more worried that there is too much of it around.The same 1929 study concluded that the known resources of tin do not satisfy the increasing demand of the industrial nations, predicting that the supply of tin would be exhausted within ten years. More than forty years later, a 1972 report stated that tin reserves would last us for only another fifteen years. Yet here we are in 2004, still using up that ten year supply that we were believed to have back in 1929.There are two chief reasons why predictions of imminent exhaustion of resources have proven false. First, they are invariably based on comparisons between existing known reserves and the rate at which they are being used up. Second, they ignore the economic mechanisms that are set in motion when any resource becomes scarce.Even in the postwar world, with unprecedented rates of economic growth, resources have more than increased to meet demand. In 1945, estimated known copper reserves were 100 million metric tons. During the following twenty-five years of economic growth, 93 million metric tons were mined, yet the reserves were estimated at more than 300 million metric tons - three times what they were at the outset.Whenever demand for any particular resource begins to run up against supply limitations, a wide variety of forces are set in motion to remedy the situation. These forces begin with a rise in price, which in turn leads to all sorts of secondary favorable feedbacks, including a shift to substitutes, an increase in exploration, and technical progress that brings down the cost of exploration, refining, and processing, as well as the costs of the substitutes.Sustainable development schemes do not account for the probability that, without unnecessary economic intervention, future generations may be much wealthier than is the current generation. That is the trend. Before asking the present generation, including its poorest members, to make sacrifices in the interests of future generations, shouldn't we take account of the strong likelihood that the latter will be far richer than the former? Where is the high ground in taking from the poor to give to the rich?Chapter 3 further explores the fallacy of basing predictions on current demands. Will future generations have the same reliance on oil and fossil fuels that we have today?In addition to the constraints on materials such as food and energy, it is argued that economic growth is leading to mass destruction of biodiversity. This destruction, the proponents of sustainable development allege, has two types of harmful effects:It deprives the human race of an essential input into our welfare, notably a source of future medicinal remedies;We are depriving future generations of the environmental inheritance that is their due.Most of the world's biodiversity is found in tropical or semitropical regions, which happen to be mainly in developing countries. In the past, any loss of biodiversity caused by humans was the result of hunting, but today it is caused almost entirely by the damage done to the habitat of millions of species that live in forests, particularly in tropical and semitropical regions.These are difficult to measure because we don't know how many species are becoming extinct each year, or even how many there are to begin with. The recorded fact that 641 species have been certified as having become extinct since the year 1600 does not exclude the possibility that many others have become extinct without anyone knowing it, particularly given that the vast majority of all species, including plants and animals, are insects, and about 40% of these are beetles.Beckerman argues that the most alarming features of the whole debate is the unscientific attitude of some distinguished biologists. There is no empirical basis for the fear that continued economic growth is unsustainable, he says. Even with respect to food or energy supplies, two types of resources that have been most frequently the subject of pessimistic predictions, there is no cause for alarm. The destruction of biodiversity also appears to be exaggerated, although the author concedes that there are some real problems in some countries.Yet, he argues, slower growth is more likely to perpetuate market failures than to promote their elimination, as faster economic growth makes it easier to compensate those who may lose out from an elimination of market imperfections.In Chapter 4, Beckerman takes on climate change. While environmental groups claim that unchecked climate change will lead to catastrophic declines in world income, requiring drastic international action to reduce carbon emissions, particularly by the advanced nations, who are regarded as morally responsible for the high carbon concentrations in the atmosphere.However, the author contends, three key points need to be established in order to justify international action to reduce carbon emissions on the grounds of overall benefit to the global community:Predictions of significant climate change are reasonably reliable;The damage climate change might impose on the world as a whole will exceed the costs of limiting or preventing it; andThe distribution of the costs and benefits among countries of actions to drastically cut carbon emissions is accepted as reasonably equitable.Only the first link in the chain of argument gets any attention in the media, perhaps because it is the only link that has any strength at all.Even the predictions of significant climate change are probably exaggerated by the vast scientific and bureaucratic establishment that is heavily invested in advancing the threat of global warming.Even assuming that the global consensus is correct and that man-made emissions of carbon dioxide will result in an rise in average global temperatures over the course of this century, Beckerman asserts that there is no foundation for the second and third points concerning the likely impact of climate change and the way it is distributed between countries and generations.For the world as a whole, the author argues, the beneficial effects of moderate global warming in the range predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will outweigh its harmful effects chiefly because global warming will increase food production in what are now temperate or cold regions of the world.With moderate global warming, some regions will be opened up for agriculture, while growing seasons will be extended in large areas, such as the northern portions of the United States, Canada, Russia, and China. Higher carbon concentrations in the atmosphere will raise crop yields.For the world as a whole, global warming will mean more rain (or snow), and increasing cloud cover means that many parts of the world will be cooler during the day and warmer at night, leading to increased soil moisture.Given that climate change can have favorable as well as unfavorable effects, particularly in light of the enormous obstacles to accurate predictions of climate change for individual regions, it isn't surprising that most experts cannot foresee the likely net damage for the world as a whole that might result from climate change.It is true, Beckerman admits, that the impact of climate change on developing countries, where average temperatures are higher, soils are poorer, and technology and infrastructures are less developed, is likely to be harmful, yet he argues that faster economic development in these countries will help them to adapt to the change.A major flaw in the more gloomy predictions is that they assume that farmers are stupid and incapable of any adaptation to climate variations.Chapter 5 discusses the precautionary principle established as one of the basic principles of sustainable development.The idea that there can be full scientific certainty about the consequences of any change in the environment is absurd, and if it had ever been taken seriously, we'd still be living in the Stone Age. Even changes that the environmentalists favor, such as replacement of fossil fuels with other sources of energy, will have environmental effects, and it is impossible to prove that they would not have undesirable consequences of their own.It cannot be proven that there can never be harmful consequences to greater exploitation of solar energy, a longtime goal of the green movement.Only about forty years ago, there was a widespread alarm that the world was entering a new ice age. Had policies been put into place to prevent this, the results may have been, as we now know, catastrophic.Had we taken seriously past predictions of the imminent exhaustion of fossil fuels, not only would many developments that rely on inexpensive energy have been stifled in the interests of energy conservation, but many technological developments that permitted a vastly expanded disovery, exploitation, and use of sources of energy would have not have occurred. The world would be a poorer place, without many of the innovations we now depend upon, such as vaccines and antibiotics.The author suggests, as an alternative to the precautionary principles of sustainable development, waiting until we have a better idea of what we may be dealing with. Large scale action, as suggested by the proponents of sustainable development, could be catastrophic.In Chapter 6, Beckerman discusses the plan for bureaucratic regulation and protectionism.At the 1992 UNCED, the United Nations adopted a document of several hundred pages, known as Agenda 21, which set out, among other things, the agreed intentions of the countries to take account of environmental objectives in their domestic policies, to monitor their own developments from the point of view of their sustainability, and to report on these developments to the newly established Commission on Sustainable Development.In addition to the UN commission, countless other institutes, government departments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), all for the purpose of promoting sustainable development, have been established all over the world. In the United States, even while our Legislature has refused to ratify Agenda 21, its policies have been adopted by our governmental agencies and departments.One of the worst consequences of excessive bureaucratic intervention in daily life is the bureaucratic preference for regulation over market mechanisms to deal with social and economic problems. Clearly this is the case in environmental protection.The author argues that it is immoral to use public funds for the purpose of helping plants rather than people, while reducing the future income growth prospects of the poorest nations by promoting the growth-reducing program of sustainable development.Also, there is no reason why the taxpayers of wealthier nations should contribute to an action that is in the interests of a minority who happen to attach a high existence value to certain environmental assets. Taxpayers in rich countries may have higher priorities. Nothing prevents people who have a strong private preference for preserving rain forests or their indigenous species from organizing voluntary contributions to help such preservation in the same way that many charitable organizations exist so that people can make donations to help starving children overseas. Coercion to impose the environmental values of some groups of people in the developed world on the people of other nations is morally indefensible.If other countries are to be punished in some way for failing to respect universal basic values, Beckerman asserts that we should take into consideration that many of them indulge in far worse crimes against humanity than cutting down their trees. Yet these violations of basic and universally accepted human rights do not seem to arouse the same indignation among the environmental protectionists that they feel toward the failure of governments to attach an overriding importance to the protection of the environment.In the same way that for some people an excessive love of animals is the counterpart of hatred of human beings, in some people an excessive concern with future generations is the counterpart of indifference to the suffering of people alive today.Chapter 7, the last of the book, discusses the ethics of sustainable development.Beckerman points out that sustainable development is an excuse for a new form of imperialism. Regardless of the accuracy of the claims that are made, sustainable development is used as a means of controlling markets for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many. Sustainable development has practical implications that would be morally unacceptable even if its ethical foundations were valid in theory, which they are not.Even accepting the arguments of the proponents of sustainable development, which the author does not, he suggests that the projected wants and needs of future generations do not ethically trump those of the current generation. The interests that they will have must take their place in the balance together with the interests of people alive today, many of whom live in dire poverty.Still, he agrees that the interests of future generations shouldn't be ignored. He surmises that future generations are on a whole likely to enjoy much higher living standards than those prevailing today, unless growth is successfully curtailed. A rise in living standards will not ensure that all environmental problems will disappear, nor that poverty will be eradicated everywhere.The moral policy suggested by Beckerman is to weigh the interests of different generations. The safest predication that can be made is that people will always want life, security, self-respect, and freedom from tyranny, oppression, and humiliation. Unfortunately, one can also safely predict that there will always be forces in society that will threaten these basic human wants.In contrast with the problems of widespread poverty or acute environmental problems, one concern will never be eradicated: the ever-present threat to basic human rights.Sustainable development represents one such threat."},{"Title":"A Poverty of Reason: Sustainable Development and Economic Growth","review":"A laughable excuse for a scholarly book - beyond offensive misuse of research to support a shamelessly neoliberal approach to 'understanding' sustainability."},{"Title":"A Poverty of Reason: Sustainable Development and Economic Growth","review":"An excellent read, well researched and written. I recommend it to all my friends who are passionate about the environment (especially to the ones who naive). A permanent fixture in my library."},{"Title":"A Poverty of Reason: Sustainable Development and Economic Growth","review":"\\"A Poverty of Reason\\" should rightly be called \\"An Attack on the Concept of Sustainable Development\\". Beckerman's title implies that opinions other than his own are impoverished, regardless of their qualifications. The central tenant of the book, that sustainable development is inherently confusing, undesirable, and possibly immoral reminds me of a petulant conversation between an adolescent and a parent. On observing the teenager leaving the house the parent might say \\"Be safe!\\" to which Beckerman, if he were the teenager would reply \\"How safe?\\", \\"What does safe mean?\\", \\"What things are considered safe?\\", \\"How do I know when I've achieved safeness?\\". The frustrated parent knows that his child understands what he means by \\"safe\\" and although there are instances in which they might disagree on safe behavior, there are more cases in which they would agree.It is much the same with the term \\"Sustainable Development.\\" Beckerman understands full well what it means despite his lawyerly attacks on other writer's attempts to define it. God help us if Beckerman had been participating when the countries founders declared \\"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness\\" to be rights of man. Had he been alive, he would have attributed all of the ills of society in his day to ambiguity of the word \\"Happiness\\".The fact there is disagreement about a concept's meaning does not make the concept any less valuable. Beckerman should choose the join the debate rather than attacking the debate itself. I found his ideas on climate change to be one of the more reasonable chapters, not because I agree with his conclusion, but because he actually offered an opinion of his own and suggested a policy to fit it.I would recommend that Beckerman read \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" by Nassim Taleb particularly as it relates to predicting \\"Black Swan\\" events. Beckerman claims that predictions of long-term shortages of resources are wrong because some predictions have been wrong in the past. It is like saying \\"All swans are white\\" because you've never seen a black one. Observing only white swans, no matter how many you see, does not mean they are all white, while observing a single black swan does prove they are not all white. Historically, we have had numerous \\"black swan\\" events relating to resource shortage. We know they exist and that more will occur over time regardless of the accuracy of predicting them.Beckerman attempts the same philosophical drubbing of the \\"Precautionary Principal\\" that he gave \\"Sustainable Development.\\" He wants more clear definitions of the words \\"serious\\", \\"damage\\", and \\"threat\\" as if these are mystical phrases. He uses as an example of the destructive power of the Precautionary Principal the regulation of the bio-tech industry. This is an industry that has yet to articulate it safety to my father, a PhD in biology, let alone the public as a whole. His claim that developing nations are suffering as a result of the slowdown in bio-tech is a contradiction of earlier claims that there are no real food shortages, only political upheaval that distort food distribution (I happen to agree with him in this case). Clearly more rapid advances in biotech would not solve issues of political inequity.Although Beckerman has little patience with the moral aspect of environmentalism, he has little problem moralizing in general. His particular platform is the responsibility of developed nations to the developing world. To Beckerman, someone dumping toxic waste into a river is not immoral (simply violating property rights), but insisting that imported goods be held to the same environmental standards as domestic products is not only immoral, but imperialist. What rubbish! Using a tariff to raise the price of an imported good manufactured using a less-costly and more polluting method than we allow domestically is simply placing an economic value on that aspect of the environment, something that Beckerman should understand and appreciate.Beckerman seems to claim that pollution is an inevitable part of development and that is should be allowed to take its course. He believes that developed countries are less polluted today (true for some resources, not true for others) so we can expect developing countries to see improvements in their environments as they grow. But there is no reason to believe that pollution and the wholesale destruction of natural areas is a requirement for development and it should not be our standard.I do like some of Beckerman's notions (not original) of placing a market value and assigning property rights to all resources. I should have rights to the air over my home and in public areas and those that dump in it should have to pay a fee that creates a real incentive for them for reduction. The same is true of the pollution caused by mining, waste management and energy exploration to name a few. How this is accomplished without the central planning and tariffs that Beckerman abhors is a mystery to me. Surely he does not believe that these industries will offer up a pollution bounty on their own?A noted Stanford professor, speaking on global warming, said that perhaps the greatest enemy of environmentalism is the far left of the Green movement, not because their goals aren't worthy, but because their alarmist rhetoric lacks reason causing the entire movement lose credibility. Had Beckerman's book dealt with only the fringes of environmentalism I might have had some sympathy for his arguments. Attacking the goals of \\"Sustainable Development\\" as inherently immoral and imperialist is, at best, unreasonable and, at worst, silly."},{"Title":"A Poverty of Reason: Sustainable Development and Economic Growth","review":"This book is written by the type who speaks from the head - an intellectual rather than a humanist. The central theme to the book is that restraining industrial and corporate predation in the name of planetary stewardship is causing and/or excaberating social inequalities which the author would like us to see as single issue problems. This is, of course, a naive and dis-ingenuous way to present highly complex issues such as over-population and the decline of subsistence agriculture in marginal lands. I have only two conclusions from reading this book, and they are both founded on the motive of it's author. These conclusions are: either Wilfred Beckerman is a hopelessly indoctrinated special interests lobbyist, or he is too academically rational to see the spiritual side of the arguements against unrestrained capitalist expansion. And I'm a fully paid-up member of the Capitalist Pigs, so I'm not unsympathetic to the stance he tries to promote. I have, however, a firm belief, not shared by Mr Beckerman, that some of the most important aspects of humans and their psycological needs are not dollar-quantifiable so cannot be factored into a system of economics.By the end of this book, I was impressed only by the selective and incredibly mechanistic supporting arguments. I was sadly unable to either on-lend my copy or recommend anyone else to read this because it says only what we have already heard from pro-development apeasers - the assumption that the spread of Western values and attitudes is 'religiously' correct in all cultures, and that to refute the proposed development potential of third world cultures is a selfish and patronising vision of 'unqualified idealists'. There is much to dislike in the attitude of the author, not least his contention that critics of development are either 'unqualified' or 'uninformed' (how's that for patronising?) but my main review point here is that he has not addressed the crucial pivot-point of the debate - we are knowingly gambling with huge risk to our ecosystems and our diversity of cultures and all for the real benefit of profit-hungry corporations and political power bases. The real losers in the fight to preserve diversity and beauty (two concepts that the author places no dollar value on) should be these mindless and remorseless entities.The alternative scenario, boosted by the author using selective and disturbingly simple 'facts' will see the powerless of the third world move into a different and more unpleasant bondage, to a system that is even less interested in self-monitoring or spiritual values than the one they are being 'saved' from. Read this book only to see the dry and brittle hand of the older generation, still sure that it's money and military cancers are helping people live a better life. One wonders what the author does when confronted by wilderness, or wet earth after rain, or any one of a huge number of reminders to most of us that we hold a precious and vital responsibility to act at all times as if we were borrowing this planet from our grandchildren, not inheriting it from our parents."},{"Title":"Applying to College: A Planning Guide (Lifeworks Guide)","review":"After leaving the armed services, I did not plan on attending college. In fact, I never intended to go to college. The process seemed daunting. And, after what I had seen in my life through various tours in the Marines, I could not fathom how book-learning and course-work could be relevant to my life.Truth be told . . . I was scared. Applying to college required organizational skills I simply did not have. So, rather than pursuing this challenge, I preferred to think of it as a non-option, a waste of time. Nonetheless, I found myself coaxing my friends to send away for brochures and applications. I experienced college vicariously through the smiles and comaraderie depicted in the pages of Beaver College, State University of Alabama, and Boomerton College. It was exciting and I got hooked.Hooked with no where to go. No plan for how to tackle the task of a college application. No plan for how to make my dream a reality.That's where Ms. Watts' book stepped in. A clerk at the local bookshop pointed me in the direction of books geared towards helping people like myself tackle the application process. He offered no recommendations, but Casey Watts' book caught my eye. A quick skim revealed this book to be a treasure trove of knowledge, a compendium of wisdom. Casey Watts is to the planning and organization industry what Martha Stewart is to home decorations and gourmet cooking . . . though, from what I know, Casey has never been, and hopefully never will be, incarcerated.If the doors to opportunity ever seemed closed to you in your life, turn to Ms. Watts.

His columns had been supposedly written by archy, one letter at a time. archy would climb to the top of Marquis's typewriter, then throw himself head first at the key he wanted to hit.

It is about Archie, a poet and philosopher in a former life, transmigrated into the body of a cockroach. At night he takes over the typewriter of a human writer who is kind enough to always leave an empty sheet of paper in it before retiring. Archie pounds out stories about himself, his views and feelings, working with all his might. The other character is Archie's friend Mehitibel, a very precocious alley cat, transmigrated into her present form but having once been Cleopatra. Mehitabel exhibits a special savoir-faire. She has many adventures which Archie types out so the world will know how Mehitabel survives on the streets, her philosophy and off-handed views of life. It also shows her acceptance of life as it is and her philosophical turnings. Their adventures are a delight for those who enjoy the whimsical, have a vivid imagination, and are fun-loving in spirit."},{"Title":"Archy and Mehitabel","review":"I have an old hard cover copy that at belonged to my dad.

I highly recommend it, especially as a gift to stuffed shirts, preachers, and high society."},{"Title":"Archy and Mehitabel","review":"\\"Archy and Mehitabel\\" is a strange, funny little book. Drawing from the conversational poetry found in books like Edgar Lee Masters \\"Spoon River Anthology,\\" Marquis uses a colloquial style which not only suits his characters, but works in a poem. Lots of laughs, some decent writing, and a tasty way to spend a Saturday afternoon.Talking animals are easy to find in literature. Good ones, like a cat and a cockroach of this caliber, are not. Marquis brings humanity by allowing his animals to stay animals. Spiders still are poisonous, rats are still threatening, and cockroaches have never been able to type the capital letters on a typewriter. Marquis pushes reality, keeping his characters grounded in truth (OK, he fudges with truth a lot, but don't let that stop you).While filled with humorous tales, moments are sad, like in the ninth poem, \\"freddy the rat perishes.\\" Dear Freddy has a run in with a spider who is up to no good. In a valiant struggle, a tough South American spider (\\"raised on red pepper and blood\\" and \\"nursed on tabasco sauce\\") Freddy is killed while saving his friends. Freddy ate some poisoned cheese the night before and let the spider bite him, knowing he had nothing to lose. After it was over, Archy and Mehitabel dropped Freddy \\"off the fire escape into the alley with/military honors\\". Despite the whole premise being ridiculous, a tear might well up.Children will love being read the stories, and younger teens may find poetry readable (before you send them on to Keats and Byron!). Great, funny pictures, completely in the context of each poem-tale.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Archy and Mehitabel","review":"metthinksthe vers libre ofarchy literate cockroachand mehitabel krazy kat s kouzinare amazing and amuzinggood thing amazon.com has mostof the cocroaches volume via marquisherriman s drawings capturesmarquises tone and surrrealityand hyperreality perfectlylike a cross between a gloriouspost apocalypse a goofy satmorning cartoon and an unkept roadsidechuck wagon i believe weall should keepcockroach farmsjust incase just incaseygsgs"},{"Title":"Archy and Mehitabel","review":"archy (or is it don marquis)is a greater poetthan the critics admitthink of e.e. cummingsdid he suffer so by divingheadfirst on to the typewriter keysbut he probably knew archyfrom some greenwich villagecoffeehouseamazing to think these poemswere newspaper columnswhen a column meant a columnstraight down the inky newsprintarchy's words staining fingersthe newspaper column had a golden agealas it is gone poor archyand now i too have a headache"},{"Title":"Archy and Mehitabel","review":"Archy and Mehitabel came into my college mailbox over and over again back in the early 40s.

He describes this difficult and complex subject concisely and meticulously. To be sure, he wrote this text as an argument for a specific policy objective (keeping flexibility in the sovereign debt workout process), and does not shy away from hammering his point home multiple times. However, his agenda in no way diminishes the accuracy of his history or his factual descriptions of the entities that shaped it. The first four chapters are an excellent primer on the subject, and could stand alone. The later chapters provide a wealth of detail, perfect for those who need it, albeit a bit tedious for anyone not directly involved in sovereign lending.

The impact and fear of losing one's life in a heroic act - the ultimate sacrifice one could make - is almost nil in modern comic books. Characters die and return from the grave almost constantly, an unfortunate cliche that has hurt the mainstream's view of comics-as-art and rendered death as nothing more than a temporary setback for superheroes.Aside from the very concept itself, Jason's return is also poorly executed. The new Black Mask, who is woefully out of character, is still present. The Joker is sacrificed to Jason Todd's credibility. And how does Jason come back, you ask? What's the cool creative explanation that isn't a tired IC-related explantion that doesn't fit the Batman universe motif? *Spoilers*: Superboy-Prime punching the walls of a paradise in another dimension is the explanation. Jason wakes up in his coffin and digs his highly battered young body out of his coffin and 6ft of dirt using only his belt buckle. The coffin had sensors that could detect people getting in, but amazingly could not detect people getting out. What kind of crazy silly sensors are those? A new coffin is reburied, and the greatest, I repeat greatest, detective in the world, who forensically examines the coffin in all its minutia, neither notices the reburial or the new coffin. I couldn't make this junk up. A must not read for batfans, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Make no mistake that Outsiders and Green Arrow scribe Judd Winick is a talented writer, although for some his run on Batman would be a cause for some to think otherwise. For well over a decade now the character of Jason Todd, AKA the Robin that was voted dead by readers, has been dead and remained so; a feat that is impressive for a comic book character. Now, enter this TPB, where the long dead Jason Todd has returned from the dead, and if you're looking for a reason why (other than maybe Winick ran out of ideas) you won't find it here. The storyline picks up with Black Mask as the undisputed crime lord of Gotham City, until the mysterious Red Hood enters the game and causes problems for both Batman and Black Mask. Eventually it's revealed that it's Jason Todd \\"under the hood\\" (heh, heh) and back from the dead to oppose the Dark Knight, and also in the jumbled story is Mr. Freeze and a couple hundred pounds of Kryptonite. Besides Todd being resurrected, the story itself is lacking, and the dialogue and action are some of the worst Winick has scripted. The art does it's job for the most part, but it doesn't save the story. It's a shame that characters that have been dead in comics for so long, like Todd and recently Bucky in Marvel's Captain America, are being brought back from the dead all of the sudden after a few years of a sort of comic renaissance, but we all knew that one day this would be bound to happen. Give it a look if you're a Batfan, but other than that leave this on the shelf."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Another example of the often overused device of bringing super characters back from the dead.

Those approaches can be great, but sometimes it's fun to simply enjoy a solid story built on the elements we've come to know and love about a character and his or her world. And that's what you get with this first volume presenting the recent \\"Under the Hood\\" storyline from Batman's regular comic book title.\\"Batman: Under the Hood, Volume 1\\" collects six issues of mystery and adventure, as a strange new figure, the Red Hood, begins to disrupt Gotham City's underworld, using tactics much more savage and brutal than Batman's own none-to-gentle techniques. Reacting most dramatically to the Red Hood's new war on crime is the creepy, deadly crime boss known as the Black Mask, and the Batman himself. The former justs wants the Red Hood out of the way, and the latter doesn't like the merciless approach of the Red Hood, especially when clues point to the Red Hood possibly being someone who was close to Batman in the not-too-distant past.As said, this isn't a storyline like \\"Identity Crisis\\", which combined unconventional story-telling with unprecedented revelations, or \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", which presented an out-of-continuity original take on a superhero character (the Batman himself, in that case). No, the \\"Under the Hood\\" storyline simply delivers a solid story (by Judd Winick) and terrific art (by Doug Mahnke and Tom Nguyen) that throws lots of fun and drama our way, the kind of stuff that's familiar but never dull when it's done right. You get crime bosses, superhero guest appearances, a handful of super-villains, dark alleys, moves and counter moves, some big revelations, and lots of action. It's all great. An added nice touch is the inclusion of Matt Wagner's stylish and moody covers from the original issues, interspersed throughout this collection.For the money, you can't beat this collection, which will provide several hours of immersive entertainment. Just be warned: the story continues in \\"Batman: Under the Hood, Volume 2\\", which I just purchased. By the way, I'm diving into these \\"Under the Hood\\" collections because DC is adapting this storyline into an upcoming direct-to-DVD animated film, to be entitled \\"Batman: Under the Red Hood\\", and I wanted to experience the original storyline first. I'm betting the movie will be decent, as it will have a lot of good stuff to draw from, but I'm glad that I'm experiencing the original epic first, before it's inevitably pared down to fit into a 75-minute movie.Anyway, if you still have a soft spot for good, old-fashioned superhero action and melodrama, you can't go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"This book was great, and I think underrated.

The story includes appearances by Nightwing, Superman, and Green Arrow.In this, you really see Batman doubting himself and becoming obsesive. Its really good. HOWEVER i would recomend buying both volumes because once you finish Volume 1, you will want to read on."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"It's a shame that some people cannot allow themselves to view this story with an open mind, mostly due to the return of Jason Todd, and for some, a strong disliking for writer Judd Winick. Since I had no previous exposure to either and thus no bias pro or con, I was able to judge this story strictly on its' own merits, and they are many. Among them are witty dialogue, action packed scenes not just included to pad pages, and numerous quality guest stars, hero and villain alike, who actually enhance the story and not appear to fill a quota. In Todd, you have the prototype antihero who is willing to cross the line Batman won't. In Black Mask, you have a great villain who is both a total bad guy yet humorous also, somewhat like the Joker is supposed to be but rarely is. And with Batman, we see a man experiencing pain and anguish that has haunted him for years and his current confusion over an apparent resurrection of a ghost. If used properly, Todd could fill a void in the DCU for his type of character, even as the person you love to hate, and be an interesting foil for Batman to confront in the years to come. Hopefully DC will find a niche for him within the Bat family and take advantage of future story possibilities that his inclusion would provide."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Notwithstanding the theatrics and grumbling fans, this piece is a good one for any Batman fan. Because the thumbs came down in 1988 to kill off Jason Todd (Robin II), his recent return as the Red Hood has lead readers to groan and moan in disdain. Weep not, for Jud Winick delivers the goods sufficiently.What \\"Under the Hood\\" does NOT do is explain *how* Jason is back, but instead, offers the reason *why* he is doing what he does. No longer confined to the rules and demands of a purely righteous \\"good guy\\", Jason has become a ruthless one-sided anti-hero as well as a challenging adversary to both Batman and the crime lord Black Mask. He is determined to purge Gotham of its evils by killing anyone who stands in his way. Too dangerous to be a hero but not exactly a villain, it can only be left to the readers as to how (or if) Batman can stop Jason.Perhaps one of the psychological reasons why fans found Jason an insufferable Robin was because his streetwise aggressive nature clashed with Batman's rigid ethics and values. (He once pushed a rapist off a building to his death). As the new Red Hood, Jason is free of Batman's grip and the restrained role of Robin. He has unleashed his inner demon and his mentor cannot control him this time. Winick introduces a new Jason who has a cool collected manner, cunning ruthlessness, a modified look with a menacing kris dagger, and a smart mouth that orders around the thugs of Gotham and taunts Batman for his failure.Fans that do want to know the $25,000 dollar question of how Jason's resurrection came about can pick it up in Batman Annual #25. Again, the rewards are highly demanding as readers discover that Jason's return was not a cheap shot simply done with just a Lazarus Pit (as we all assumed from the beginning) but seamlessly woven into the epic \\"Infinite Crisis\\" story that swept us off our feet and redefined the DC world.Even the most jaded Batfan should give this story a second chance. Winick's storytelling is more than adequate (certainly better than Miller's \\"All Star Batman and Robin\\") and the artwork is crisp and clean. The fans said they wanted Jason dead and they got it. But nobody said he had to STAY dead..."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"this book tells the missing lick of the death of jason and the red hood. every page fills you with a ooh, and ah,"},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"I was out of comics for a while, and picked this Graphic Novel, great way to catch up!"},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"You know...

His work on Outsiders has always seemed rather lacking to me and while I have enjoyed his Green Arrow work it never struck me as brilliant. Under the Hood is really very good, leaps and bounds ahead of his other work.His handling of Batman is great, he is driven and obsessed but more likeable than I have seen him be in a while. The subtle ways in which he deals with the trust issues left by Identity Crisis are also quite good. Winnick handles the conflict between Batman and the Red Hood quite well, building suspense and excitement. Black Mask also comes across as a great character ruthless but quite funny at times.Overall its a good package.Now if only Winnick could write Nightwing this well in the Outsiders."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Okay, do NOT read this review if you don't want any spoilers. It's impossible for me to write a review about this book without a spoiler. Okay now that, that's out of the way, here's the review...Batman Under the Hood collects Batman #635-641 and is written by Judd Winick (Green Arrow) and illustrated by the ex-art team of JLA, Doug Mahnke and Tom Nguyen. The story starts of with a mysterious vigilante/criminal coming into Gotham City on the heels of War Games and challenges the current mob-boss Black Mask. The Red Hood is soon shown to be ruthless as he kills and maims anyone who gets in his way. The Red Hood even steals 100 lbs of Kryptonie and activates an Amazo (with the combines power of the JLA) to take on Batman and Nightwing. Red Hood comes off as a very formidable for for Batman But through out his escapades there is a hint of familiatrity. Now, the Red Hood seems like any other Batman villain but his true identity is what's shocking....it's the resurrected Jason Todd. Yes, the same Jason Todd who died at the hands of the Joker and has stayed dead for the better part of a decade and a half. He's back and apparently like everyone in Comics, he didn't stay dead either.Now, I was really torn over this story. I hate seeing characters brought back because it cheapens the entire death scenerio. And someone like Jason, whom the readers voted (via the 900 number) to kill off, it's a real thorne on my side. But I have to admit that Winick brought him back in a very stylish manner and if I had to bring him back, I couldn't imagine any better way of doing this. The dialogues are sharp and sometimes has a sardonic humor to it. The last scene where Red Hood's idenity is revealed is very bittersweet. It's like finding a long lost friend but then you realize that he is not the same friend you knew.This event ties in with the current monthly Infinite Crisis event happening at DC and the mystery is far from over so do not expect any closures of any sort in this book. The entire book is the revelation of Red Hood's idenitity and leaves you with more questions then answers which I eagerly look forward to being answered in future volumes.Recommendation --- pretty cheap price tag, excellent story, stylish art, definitely pick it up."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Gotham's criminal underworld is ruled by Black Mask. But someone is trying to undermine his operations...and it's not Batman. His face is one well known among comic fans...The face of Jason Todd. Now Batman has to face his worst fears: His former protege has returned from death to battle evil on his own, lethal terms.This is an excellent story, Judd Winick is an incredible writer who knows how to spin a tale that entertains readers. I love his use of dialogue, \\"Do you prefer I call you Black Mask...Mr. Mask...Blackie?\\" He is able to make the characters real and Batman is excellent in this story. I highly reccomend that you buy it."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Few writers have the ability to truly capture Batman's essence. But Judd Winick pulls it off with little effort.The art work here is nothing short of great, but it's not quite as good as Jim Lee's work in \\"Hush.\\" Still, if you're looking for some great art and one of the best interpretations of The Joker, this is a book you shouldn't miss.The story picks up shortly after War Games and Identity Crisis and leads directly into Infinite Crisis, if you read both volumes.This first volume really concentrates on where Batman is as a hero and as a person.During War Games Stephanie Brown, The Spoiler and Robin IV, is killed. For those who didn't know, Tim Drake quit soon after Identity Crisis due to the death of his father. It was very tragic, I suggest you read it before reading this. War Games lacks as a story but it's important to understand the events of this story.Here we get the re-introduction of a character known as The Red Hood. He's out to take over the crime in Gotham City and sees both Black Mask and Batman as problems. However, his efforts are more concentrated on taking out Black Mask.For those who remember, The Red Hood was the original identity used by The Joker before his chemical bath. This is a clue to Red Hood's actual identity, which most people figured out long before it was revealed in volume two.Winick deserves a lot of credit for getting inside each of the characters he chose to focus on. Here he demonstrates a deep love and understanding of what makes Batman who he is.The only person who probably understands Batman better than Winick is Jeph Loeb. However, given where this story eventually winds up, even Loeb might not have been able to pull this piece off with as much grace and style as Winick.The problems with this book are few but they are there.Some people will complain that this story undoes years of history and that it violates the character of Jason Todd and Batman and that Infinite Crisis was used as a cheap way of bringing Jason Todd back to life.Maybe, but Jason Todd has played an intricate role in Batman's life ever since his death and it stands to reason that he would eventually make another appearance. Especially given that his death was caused by a 1-900 number instead of an editorial decision. His death was a clear example of why fans should not be allowed to determine the outcome of a story arc.Given the choice between killing someone and letting them live, fans always seem to want death. Probably because they didn't actually believe DC would go that far.Jason Todd really has made for a great villain and, in the hands of such good writers and artists, he's really making the most of his new lease on life.Another thing Winick does better than most other writers is working humor into his stories. The dialogue Black Mask has with Mr. Freeze and The Red Hood is simply hilarious. I never knew just how funny his character could be until this story.This story ends with a nice cliffhanger so you'll have to get the second volume to find out what happens. I suggest you do so and ignore the unjustifiable criticism, judge it for yourself."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"This is an interesting and very well written series. The dialogue is sharp, quick-witted, and fun to read. I enjoyed the beautiful artwork and the story line was un-muddled and easy to follow. Bats comes in contact with a few old cronies as well with satisfying results. I won't give away the ending, but it makes me wish for more."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Black Mask is now the nearly undisputed crime lord of Gotham. Hiring Mr. Freeze as an enforcer, he wants to continue exerting force to perpetuate his strangle hold of power. However, a new threat emerges that is reminiscent of a different era of the Batman mythos: the Red Hood.Red Hood acts as a spoil to Black Mask, undermining every criminal enterprise. Red Hood, however, is a vicious killer whose efficiency rivals, if not surpasses, even the League of Assassins. His movements, methods, and personality all bother Batman; it is as though a ghost has come back to haunt him.Who is \\"Under the Hood?\\" It is a well-drawn and written comic. What I really like is the flippant nature of the Red Hood. I don't know if this makes sense, but all the other villains are deeply invested in their gimmicks and perceived psychoses. Red Hood just gets the job done. He doesn't have the potential weaknesses that other villains like Joker and Riddler have.The new Red Hood does something that few others in Gotham achieves. He seems to disrupt the stoic confidence that Batman brings to battle. An unease exists in the mind and heart of Bruce Wayne; he must confront what everything he stands for contradicts, he must acknowledge that he too, has a heart. This is a good graphic novel.However, the novel ends once Batman sees who is under the hood. I wanted more of an explanation as to how the ending came about, the sort of wrap up in a Detective Story like in Columbo or Sherlock Holmes. Despite a lack of sufficiency in bringing full closure to the plot, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"I loved \\"A Death in the Family\\". The Joker's massacre of Jason Todd is still a haunting moment in Batman history. When I heard Todd had been revived and was back as the Red Hood, I thought it was a ridiculous idea. Picking up the volume I was welcomely suprised by just how good it was. The artwork is superb, the dialogue engaging, and the entire atmosphere addictive. The build-up to the Red Hood's unmasking was well paced, even if I allready knew the climax. Black Mask, as always in these recent titles, is a joy to read and a fantastic villain, now in control of the Gotham underworld. He is a ruthless, sadistic buisnessman with some very memorable, often hillarious lines. I was also happy to see a villainous gem like Mr. Freeze included. Very well executed."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"Collected here are the seven issues (Batman #535-641) that introduce the new Red Hood character, ending with the big reveal of his identity. While I won't spoil that reveal here, I will say that if you've read internet comic news sites or message boards, most likely you, like I, already know the Red Hood's identity. Going into this knowing that did not ruin the story for me, and in some ways, may have improved it.First things first, I'm not a huge fan of Judd Winick's writing. I found his Green Lantern to be too steeped in trying to be \\"hip,\\" not to mention Judd's penchant for weaving controversial social themes into his stories (something this collection is without). Neither were noticeable in this story and, in fact, this storyline has done much to convince me that Judd Winick is the decent writer others have claimed he is. He won me over with this issue.The story starts off in the present, as Batman chases a hooded assailant across the rooftops, while his internal dialogue points out that this unknown adversary is very skilled and very good at what he does. The climax comes as Batman is unmasked and the Red Hood tells Batman it's time to even things out and removes his hood, to Batman's shock (though we are not privy to who is under the hood).The story then starts five weeks earlier and progresses until the last chapter, when we see who the Red Hood is, and the final few pages deal with Batman's reaction to the unmasking.Overall, the story structure is similar to Jeph Loeb's \\"Hush,\\" as a masked adversary with ties to Batman's past works behind the scenes and Batman works to unravel the mystery, while meeting various people from the Bat mythos and the DCU proper along the way. Of course, except for a key piece of the reveal referencing \\"Hush,\\" that is where the similarities end.Not being a big fan of the Batman comics, and therefore not being up on current events in Gotham, this collection did a good job of giving me the details I needed, without making me feel like I was missing a lot by not reading those issues. Though reading on-line about the \\"War Games\\" crossover might help flesh out a little of the back story.There are a lot of fun \\"surprises\\" in this collection, including an old Batman foe, an old Justice League foe, another old Batman foe gets what's coming to them, and of course, the big surprise of who the Red Hood is at the end. Each one made for an interesting part of the story, adding the right amount of suspense to this tale.Perhaps the best part of the book though is the view into Batman's place in the DCU. We see the effects of the recent \\"War Games\\" crossover, as well as the sale of Kord Industries (mentioned in \\"DC's Countdown to Infinite Crisis\\"). We also see Batman interact with a few key players in the DCU going into Infinite Crisis and how he handles each meeting is very telling. Batman has alienated a lot of people, and we've seen that in the past, but we get a good glimpse of how others have alienated Batman as well.I took a shot on this collection, knowing that Judd Winick was not one of my favorite writers. I came out pleasantly surprised and eager to get the second collection of this storyline (\\"Under the Hood,\\" Vol. 2 for those keeping track). I'd recommend this collection to anyone interested in reading recent tales of Batman, even those unfamiliar with Batman's recent history, as well as anyone who has a love of the characters and the DCU in general."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"good book. very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly.."},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","review":"The criminal underworld is active in Gotham City and as usual the gangs tend to fight each other as much as they do the forces of law enforcement. Enter the new super criminal Black Mask, a psychotic killer that suffered horrific burns to his face in a battle with Batman. His plan is to take control of all the criminal activity in Gotham City and he is bringing in the goods and hiring the muscle to carry out his plan.However, there is a force besides Batman that stands in the way of the Black Mask. It is a mysterious figure that wears a red mask, is very capable yet not super powered and does not hesitate to kill in order to get their way. The Red Mask does have some moral scruples as he is careful to kill only the bad guys but his methods are repugnant to Batman. When Batman sees the face of the Red Mask he is appalled and then embarks on a quest to question some of his fellow heroes that have come back from the dead.To the Red Mask, it all appears as if it is a game. He foils the Black Mask over and over again yet never seems interested in anything other than infuriating him. The battles rage back and forth in a three-way truel between the Black Mask, the Red Mask and his allies and Batman with his allies. Sometimes Batman and group are fighting the forces of the Black Mask and other times Batman is up against the Red Mask.The story moves very quickly and has enough twists and gyrations to keep you largely clueless as to what is going to happen next. It is very exciting and dramatic, so much so that once I completed this book I had to immediately buy the sequel."},{"Title":"Kundun Pb","review":"The Dalai Lama is leading the greatest David and Goliath struggle in world history and he doesn't even own a sling shot. His weapons of choice against China, the most brutal government on the planet, are words and truth. This book is worth a read as is Tears of Blood by Mary Craig.

This book and Tears of Blood are stories of trying to save the human soul...And the human spirit and neither have a religion."},{"Title":"Kundun Pb","review":"I've read 5 books on Tibet recently, and this one was perhaps the best. It is full of factual history of life before, during and after the Chinese occupation of Tibet, but it also includes personal recollections of the Dalai Lama and his family members, and anecdotes from other key individuals. The story itself is fascinating. If you're interested in finding out what happened to the Tibetan people, you will be well-informed by reading &quot;Kundun.&quot; By the way, it is not the same as the movie &quot;Kundun,&quot; which was based very closely on the Dalai Lama's autobiography. Very enjoyable to read. Thanks, Mary!"},{"Title":"Kundun Pb","review":"Mary Craig has done a wonderful job in depicting the family struggles of the present Dalai Lama. How DOES a peasant family resolve the situation of having an enlightened being born into their simple abode? In any culture this would be a great honor, but in Tibet this was honor beyond belief - a pressure which the family do not appear to have fared well from.While Mary Craig depicts the already known information in an efficient and succinct manner, she does avoid the controversial issues surrounding the Dalai Lama's brothers and their present artificially 'elevated' positions. Craig would have done well to read the wonderful and recently published &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; by Richard G. Patton. In this, she would have seen how another great writer deals with a parallel situation, yet instead of avoiding the controversies, Patton meets the bull head on and delivers! If only you had gone that extra mile Mary? It is great to see how Hollywood has finally woken up to the people's need for material beyond mere bubble-gum for the eyes. I hope all those writers keep these exceptional books coming. In the meantime, I'm off to see how they work out on screen!"},{"Title":"Trap for Cinderella (An Inner sanctum mystery)","review":"A Trap for Cinderella is a masterpiece of fiction. It is the story of a young woman who has lost her identity and continues to lose it as she finds herself deeper and deeper in a morass of passion, greed, bitterness, and sexuality. Each way she turns, she finds a new persona for herself, and new victims. Each shadowy profile she sees of herself is obliterated: she is beautiful, but hated; she is loved, and despised; she is rich, but poor. And she is a gentle human being who may also be a murderer.In the end, the relief comes not from finding out who is murdered and who has committed the crime, but from the simple act of knowing the truth, however shocking and ugly it may be.This is a short book, but spare and beautiful. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Trap for Cinderella (An Inner sanctum mystery)","review":"It's an excellent novel that transgresses the limitations of the detective genre. Unfortunately, the translation is not very good.

There aren't just plot twists, reading one of his stories is like taking a roller coaster ride with hairpin bends. You're never really sure what the answer is, and yet if you pay attention, maybe you are. When you think you've found an answer, it opens up more questions, revealing levels of complexity most writers never approach. What I particularly like is, he doesnt use exotic and high-flying settings like english manor houses, international espionage, the world of high finance, etc. Like that American genius Rod Serling, Japrisot's plots happen to ordinary people, a salesperson, a bank teller, a truck driver, a farmer. If his books dont hold your attention nothing will. Also the translations have been dynamite and lose nothing. When I run out of his books that have been put into English, I already am stacking up the ones only available in French. Everyone of the four I have read have been masterpieces."},{"Title":"Trap for Cinderella (An Inner sanctum mystery)","review":"read this years ago and am thrilled to find it again. i remember that the translation from the french was horribly mangled, but the story was so good, it overcame. would make an excellent movie.

Though I had no intention of buying anything, Trap's premise was so clever that I could not bear to leave the book behind. I am glad that I purchased the book, because it is an intelligent mystery that entertains the reader while also causing him or her to think.Trap's plot centers on a young woman who is found badly burned and suffering from amnesia after a fire. (If I had to be criticial of Trap, I would note that amnesia has appeared in too many mystery stories). Since another woman died in the same fire, no one can be certain of the survivor's identity. As the novel progresses, it becomes apparent that the fire might have been the result of foul play. So, is the survivor the victim or the killer? That clever twist, well-drawn characters, and a vivid French setting all make Trap a winner.If you like mysteries, but find too many mystery novels to be dull and predictable, Trap just might be the book for you."},{"Title":"Trap for Cinderella (An Inner sanctum mystery)","review":"I first read Sebastien Japrisot because Amazon so frequently included his name under &quot;also bought&quot;. This time I was well rewarded. Japriscot's work, like most authors, varies in quality - this book falling close to the middle of his quality. A Trap for Cinderella is interesting because of the intrigue upon intrigue as to the identity of the burn victim. The final answer is neither self-evident nor surprising. Rather the reader is led through a narrowing maze of possibility until finally the final answer is disclosed - an answer that is satisfying because it has been threaded throughout the story as one possible outcome."},{"Title":"Trap for Cinderella (An Inner sanctum mystery)","review":"This is a slender book of tremendous suspense.

I am writing this in the feeble hope that anyone who does read it will make an effort to buy the book on this site, since you have about zero chance of getting it anywhere else.\\"If This Be Glory\\" is a memior of the Eastern Front in WWII, written in the third rather than the first person. The author Hasso G. Stachow, is an Ostfront veteran, but his subject is Herbert Quast, a run-of-the-mill product of Nazi Germany who served on the Leningrad Front from 1942 until the end of the war.There is nothing very special about Quast -- he's skinny, spectacled, and not terribly good-looking -- and that is probably why Stachow chose him as a subject. Instead of the famous general or highly decorated junior officer memiors that abound, we get a view of war from the four-eyed view of a thoroughly ordinary (except for his intelligence) young man, whose experiences mirror millions of others, except for the fact that he lived where many of them died.Quast was a boy when Hitler came to power and went through the mill of Jungvolk, Hitler Youth, and eventually, officer candidate school, where his outspoken criticism of the training agenda gets him sacked and shipped off to the front as a common signaler (equivlent to a Spec-4 in the U.S. Army, probably). He ends up in the forgotten Leningrad front, which remained largely static from the fall of 1941 until late 1944, and more resembled the muddy, trench-ridden, barbed-wire infested no-man's-land of WWI battlefields than any campaign of WWII. As a signaler, Quast is repsonsible for sneaking off into no-man's-land and listening in on Soviet communications' a vital, highly dangerous, and completely thankless job where the a single mistake leads to instant death or mutilation. This is tough enough, but later, as the Soviets go to the offensive and the war goes out of the trenches and enters a mobile phase, he joins an elite \\"assault battalion\\" thrown in by the army high command when all else has failed. The combat sequences here are harrowing -- American units were considered 'devastated' if they lost 10-15% of their fighting strength, but in Quast's outfit casualties often exceeded 80%: in one memorably awful scene, the sole surviving officer of the thousand-man outfit calls roll and gets about fifty responses, and when he gets to the last company is told, \\"No one left, lieutenant.\\"As is usually the case with novels and memiors about war, Quast undergoes a slow, painful transition from naive youngwar enthusiast with delusions of glory and immortality, to an embittered cynic, disgusted with the waste, cruelty, and needless suffering of the front, yet equally hateful towards the hypocrisy of the rear areas. For every kindly officer and NCO, fatherly sergeant, loyal \\"Kamerad\\" and free-loving female nurse or auxillary, there is a barracks-room tyrant, a bullying petty official, an unscrupulous supply sergeant, or a hypocrite in a fancy uniform screaming ridiculous propiganda from a very safe distance. One by one, the glittering ideals of National Socialist egalitarianism, \\"volksgemeinschaft\\" (the theory that war could give the civilian population the same bonds of loyalty and selflessness shared by combat soldiers), and glory fade and crumble in the face of horrible reality. Ultimately, Quast rejects everything except the brotherhood of his fellow front-line soldiers, volunteering to return to duty even after horrible wounds, the deaths of his closest friends, and despite an iron certainty that the war is lost, because there is simply no where else for him to go.Stachow's writing style is superb -- he has masterful powers of description and writes with a wonderful economy. The only real flaw is the terseness of the final chapters, which follow the final months of the war and Quast's ultimate fate in a \\"peace-torn\\" Germany. He easily could have written another 50 pages without slowing the pace, but this is a minor criticism: as is, the book is a wonderful, fast-paced read, and while \\"If This Be Glory\\" is a largely forgotten book, like its subjects, it deserves to be remembered."},{"Title":"If This Be Glory","review":"The author, Hasso G. Stachow, lived the experiences related through the eyes of the novel's main character Herbert Quast, who serves on the northern sector of the Eastern Front during WWII. Stachow, who was wounded several times in the East while fighting as an NCO in an army assault battalion, is on firm ground when he describes the terrain, weather, battle scenes, and how it felt to be on the receiving end of one of the Red Army's tremendous artillery barrages. Quast is a signaler, what we would call a \\"radio operator\\" today. In the novel, he is a volunteer, not a conscript. An idealist, he volunteers to fight for Germany and to acquire his share of martial glory before the war is won. He is a small lad, and wears thick glasses; not your typical Nazi Aryan. By volunteering, he escapes spending a year of drudgery in the Labor Service digging ditches. Because he has graduated from high school, he is selected for officer training. He is also honest and blunt, and runs afoul of his training officer who takes pleasure in ruining Quast's chance to earn a commission. Quast takes this experience in stride. When the young private reaches the front near Leningrad, he is disappointed to find himself assigned to a run of the mill communications company. Bored to tears, he eagerly volunteers to join an \\"intercept detachment.\\" For the uninitiated, intercept detachments laid cables in no mans land used to intercept Russian land line/telephone line communications. Over time, Quast earns the respect of his comrades and that of his divisional commander. Quast's squad leader, the unforgettable Herberle, forces Quast to volunteer for a newly formed army assault battalion in the fall of 1943. You get the sense that Herberle knows it's only a matter of time before the intercept detachment is wiped out, and he wants at least one of them to have a chance to survive. Quast leaves the unit and joins the assault battalion, fighting with it during the bitter retreat from Leningrad through much of the fighting in the Baltic States. He is severely wounded twice and ends up fighting in the west in the final months of the war. Anyway, this is a fantastic read. The intercept detachments, as described in the book, were used by the German Army in Russia. Also, by the fall of 1943, German armies had commenced forming assault battalions (usually one per army) because replacements weren't keeping up with casualties and reserves were few. In essence, an assault battalion was an army commander's personal reserve and was usually committed where the fighting was most desperate to accomplish missions of the highest importance to the commander. As a consequence, casualties in these units were frighteningly high. The author captures the drama and despair; cowardice and heroism. More importantly, through Quast's eyes, one catches a glimmer of the true meaning, and cost, of glory."},{"Title":"If This Be Glory","review":"Don't have much time to leave a review, but this book was so good!

Ummm...that's not right. Whatever. I've got to hurry up and review this book!!! Women's hair health is at stake. On with the show!OK gals. I've really got a lot of good info for you and this book does to. Did you know a woman's hair is supposed to be about down to her mid-back?! Yep, if you've ever seen a healthy newborn baby girl, you'll notice that her hair is this length. And no matter what you do to it, cut it with scissors, burn it with fire, shave it with a razor, as long as the girl is healthy, the hair will almost immediately grow right back! If your daughter is born and she is bald or has very little hair then she is VERY ILL. And needs the doctor's medical attention. Now if you look at most women today, their hair is about shoulder-length. This means they are pretty healthy. They probably just aren't eating right. Also, they could be eating very well and not be getting the vitamins they need due to all the chemicals and crap farmers put in our foods. Go organic and do your hair a favor. Now when a women gets a horrible disease like cancer, it is not uncommon for her to lose her hair completely. This means she will die soon. That's pretty sad.Take a look at America's History of women's hair1910s- very long hair, women were very healthy.1920s-chin length hair, women were very sickly because they spend all their time doing the Charleston1930s-still about chin length. The Great Depression caused women to be sickly1940s-WWII helped strengthen America and American's hair. It was about shoulder length.1950s-fall out from nuclear fission caused some women to be ill. Hair ranged from shoulder length to chin length. Some healthy girls had longer hair of course.1960s-The hippies lived a very organic lifestyle, therefore women finally were very healthy and had hair that was about mid-back as they are supposed to.1970s- Women were still very healthy. The hippie culture had caught on.1980s- Reagan's trickle down economics screwed up a lot of women's health therefore hair can be seen as all different lengths. There were some women who were very unhealthy and had boy length hair.1990s-Very similar to the 80s. Clinton did just as poorly as Reagan so there were a lot of unhealthy women.2000-Women are healthy due to the organic health craze, but due to, as previously stated, all the chemicals and stuff we are still consuming, women are not as healthy as they should be. There is also a strange disease going around that causes their hair to be long and short at the same time! It's like all different lengths, and colours too.So it looks like things are getting better for women's health, but things could get better. Read this book and other important health-food books gals and you will see your hair will become the proper length in no time."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"Most people know Chris Tomlin for the powerful worship music he writes, songs that are sung in thousands of worship services every Sunday Morning. He is renowned for his talent as a songwriter and worship leader, and now he has written a book. I was very much looking forward to reading it, mostly because I had read writings of his before, and they were always wonderful, thoughtful, and above all, praising and in awe of God. This book has a lot of personal stories, lots of scripture, memories of some of the songs he has written, and the verses that brought about those songs, but mostly, this book is about getting you, the reader, focused more on God, and developing a better relationship with him, and becoming who He has made us to be. Chris' desire in writing this book is to help you along your spiritual journey and share his thoughts from his experiences about God, and what God is wanting from us. It is awesome. His writing is easy to read, but without being simplistic; he adds quite a bit of humourous stories and lines in it to keep your attention and connect with you, but honestly, it wasn't needed. It's a hard book to put down. Chris writes as he if he talking with you, sharing a one-on-one conversation, which makes this book even better. My only complaint is that it is not nearly long enough.

He also goes through the creation of some of his popular songs.While I agreed with a lot of what he writes, I didn't agree on a couple of instances. The first was living the \\"unnoticed life\\". Jesus certainly did not live an unnoticed life. We are called to be servants and to be humble, but I do not believe we are called to be unnoticed. I also found the book to not have very good flow from chapter to chapter. He also includes a section on putting together a worship team which I felt was a mistake. Either the book is targeted to the individual or the worship leader, but not both. Not being a worship leader, I liked the rest of the book but I was left wondering why the in the he would include that section for people like me.However the book includes some good insights and gives a good impression of what Chris Tomlin is like.

I pray that he continues to let God work through him and that he continues to be successful, so that he can reach more people for Jesus. This book is a must for Tomlin fans. It gives history and insight into the workings of this brilliant young worship leader. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it once and may read it again."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"\\"What would Jesus do with the whole \`I am famous' thing?\\" asks Chris Tomlin in one of his many interesting discussions in this book. When a book is written by a famous musician, there is a tendency to suspect that it may be no more than a vehicle for cashing in on that fame, a type of merchandise like T-shirts, designed to bolster profits from CD sales. However, this book by Chris Tomlin, one of the most respected Christian songwriters and worship leaders of the current generation, is well written and filled with interesting and challenging insights.Where did the music that's changing our generation come from? What kind of event is so popular that university-aged people form a queue several city blocks long many hours before the event starts? What does \\"worship as a way of life\\" mean? Do we have any idea of what seeing and hearing God first hand would actually be like? What would our lives look like if we set out each day to truly live in wonder of him? The book addresses these questions and many more, drawing on well-told stories from Chris's life and experience.The book is filled with wisdom about how to become more like Jesus: \\"Lord, make me obscure;\\" \\"First to serve, last to eat;\\" \\"Faithful in little things.\\" It talks about clashes in worship styles, and tells a hilarious anecdote about the \\"steward of the human ear.\\" It talks about the role of the worship leader as a servant, and it talks about how to discover the passion or unique ability that has God's signature on it in each person's life. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"This was a fun book to read. The author is funny and at times you laugh out loud at his painful descriptions of his early experiences of being a musician and worship leader. He is honest and encouraging in helping people search and understand that God has very specific plans for our lives. My favorite line is \\"old men eating pancakes\\" - it's a great picture of seemingly nothing going on in your life but in reality God is moving. Good book."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"While Chris Tomlin does go over his story and how he got where he is, that is just the top layer of the book. The deep heart of it is what he learned through those different occassions in his life: discovery of his passion, the desire to pursue it, the times of humility, going to the mountain top and helping others to get there too. While it is some what directed to \\"worship leaders,\\" it can be applied to anyone who wants to seek God's face while they worship. Whether the worship be at a service or concert, pursuing what God created you to do, or how you live out your life day to day. Because we were all created to worship God with everything and by the world standards, that does make for an unusual life, but what an amazing adventure it is too! An adventure that makes me incredibly excited to be on, even if I don't know all of the details right now. But God does and that's all that matters!"},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"I totally agree with Melody Jones. For those of you who know Chris Tomlin, he writes books just like he writes songs...with spirit and in truth. It's definitely a book you will enjoy reading over and over again. Tomlin is, believe it or not, an average guy just like you and me. He's humble enough to tell his down sides and embarrassing part of life. You do not need to be a guitarist to read this book. In short, this book is 'indescribable.' You really have to read it to know what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"Great book. Good encouragement for those involved in worship leading in any aspect. Some pics of Tomlin's life too are included."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"Very, very helpful information as I am a new worship leader. Chris Tomlin is the best!"},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"I do not believe that God's \\"fame\\" is the exact best way to describe our life purpose. Fame is a human attribute and that is because if God were to have \\"fame\\" that is in the context of a public setting therefore making it impossible to have a PERSONAL relationship with Him because God concerned with public attention of being a \\"Hollywood celebrity\\". God is not just some bully who is trying to seek public attention, Hollywood spotlights and such as that. Rather, the Bible and all of history is a story about God's radical love for all humanity and his desire for all of humanity to experience PERSONAL satisfaction in Him (that is what it means to glorify God which we were created to do). So I don't like the way Tomlin and the Passion movement sheepishly reduces God some kind of pop star and heaven to some kind of Hollywood fan club because that is not what it is about. Yes we are created to glorify and worship God. All that means is that we find our everlasting happiness in God, in HIS glory and beauty reflected in creation, and in HIS ways. God's zeal to be glorified is NOT motivated by some idea of making His own life better but my a God centered and other-centered motive (I did NOT say man-centered, theres a difference) to love us by getting us to PERSONALLY enjoy Him. So reducing God to some kind of celebrity seeking to be publicly famous is probably not something I am going to try to do. Otherwise, I love Chris Tomlin and all of His songs because they definitely show just how beautiful God is to the soul. I love the Passion Movement because Lioue has a way of teaching the vast majesty of the holiness of God. Thanks and keep it up. I will see you in heaven and I will even more certainly and personally know the great I AM you preached."},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"I believe Chris describes, through using what God has done in his life, the way we are intended to live-A life that promotes God and His adundant love!"},{"Title":"The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life","review":"Chris Tomlin put many of his own stories in the book, which I learned a lot from.

He had a profound impact upon Desiderius Erasmus' writings, such as the \\"Praise of Folly\\" and the \\"Colloquies.\\" Even St Thomas More was greatly indebted to Lucian, whose works More translated and admired. These works are a collection of short stories in narrative and dialogue form. They are very telling of life in the second century of our era, pointing mostly to the philosophical and religious milieu of the Hellenistic world. He attacks sophists and displays his disdain for the priests of the Mystery Cults through the use fierce rhetorical invective. The dialogues with the gods, also, are entertaining bits of literary genius, which will be useful to anyone seeking knowledge of the personality and background of the traditional gods of the Hellenistic world. The Norton edition of Lucian's satires is authoritative, reliable, and will ultimately be a prize for anyone interested in the literature of classical times"},{"Title":"Selected satires of Lucian (An Aldine library edition)","review":"Lucian lived in the 2nd century A.C. He was a travelling orator. In those days people liked to listen to the witful language skills of those orators. Their speeches served no purpose, it was only meant to show off and to amuse. Besides his work as an orator, Lucian wrote a lot of 'Dialogues' or 'Satires', a kind of conversation in which he mocked several aspects of the society in those days. The most famous are 'Dialogues of the Gods', 'Dialogues of the Dead' and 'Dialogues of the courtesans'.One of my favourite satires is 'The judgement of Paris'(from Dialogues of the Gods). Athena, Hera and Aphrodite want Paris to decide which of them is the most beautiful goddess. In the manners of a real beauty contest, the three goddesses try to sell their merchandise to Paris. Finally he chooses Aphrodite and in return she promises that the most beautiful woman on earth, Helen, will be his.(It will start the Trojan War but that's another matter).If you read this book you will have a good idea of what the people in Antiquity called humour"},{"Title":"Selected satires of Lucian (An Aldine library edition)","review":"If you ever get in a mood where you're suspecting that philosophy rots the brain, take a break and dip into this wonderful book.Others have noted that Lucian influenced Erasmus. I would reply, \\"Not enough!\\" I have never been able to read more than two pages of the supposedly hilarious \\"In Praise of Folly,\\" but I can read anything and everything by Lucian, including his great satire, \\"Philosophies For Sale,\\" where Zeus tries to raise a little cash by auctioning off philosophers, beginning with \\"that long-haired guy over there,\\" Pythagoras. His little dialogue, \\"Timon,\\" has volumes to say about Wealth, and says it all in about fifteen pages.Lucian loves to poke fun at Socrates, as well, openly doubting the \\"purity\\" of Socrates' love for handsome young men.\\"Alexander the Quack Prophet\\" may be Lucian's best piece. It's based upon a real person who lived at the same time as Lucian. I think the most memorable character is one Rutilianus, who is a mature, sensible Roman who has served Rome well in many important functions, but has a serious screw loose when it comes to religious gullibility. The satire is really deadly, especially if you have ever known someone who fits \\"the Rutilianus Profile.\\" :-)It's fun reading, but, like most satire, it's making some serious points during all the fun."},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"First, I like this book. I trust about every line of it. It is itself precise or at least as precise as possible. It summarizes things in a concise and complete way. Required prior knowledge is UML (of course). I'd recommend Fowler's beautiful UML distilled and also even more important a solid understanding of design by contract. I recommend the complete book of Bertrand Meyer &quot;Object Oriented Software Construction&quot;. Yes I know its many month of reading.The problem with this OCL book is the following: It is difficult to understand anything not prior understood. However once one has a grasp of understanding this book is really clarifying. So, it requires in many areas more maturity in the field than most of us including me have. So, I would wish a book, which starts of at a somewhat lower level, in a less dry diction."},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"To manage large computing projects, we need two things. Precise languages and the will to use them. While the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a valuable addition to our tool set, it is limited when used to describe and restrict the behavior of our objects. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) allows for the formal description of constraints on the data to be used. Given the ability to write specific constraints on information, it is then possible to use a design by contract model in the creation of software. The advantages of such a model are obvious, in that so much of our personal and professional lives are based on contracts, albeit most are informal. Professional interactions that take place in the creation of complex software are also contracts. I have participated in many discussions of the form, \\"You construct this function so that it does this and I will use it to do the other thing.\\" However, so much of this is informal, which leads to disagreements over interpretations. It is for this reason that I have long argued that the real increase in productivity from the use of formal languages will be a reduction in the amount of time needed to settle disputes over ambiguities.While some exposure to the principles of formal logic will be helpful, it is not necessary to understand the material of the book. Knowledge of basic Boolean expressions will suffice. As the title suggests, the UML is used as the basis for the OCL. The use of the similar notation and terminology really simplifies the approach, making it very easy to pick up.I was most impressed with the OCL as well as the explanatory style used in the book, although I must confess to having a bias towards formal languages in computing. After reading the book, I came away with an even greater appreciation for the power of formal languages, which given my nearly two decades of exposure to them, is not an easy task.The design by contract model of computing is a very powerful mechanism whereby ambiguity can be removed from the design and implementation process. To do it properly, a formal language such as OCL is needed and this book will teach it to you in the minimal amount of time."},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"The Object Constraint Language is an extension to the latest version of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). It is a formal specifications language that has an easy understandable syntax and semantics.The sample class diagram model that is used through most of the book is semi-complex but understandable if first you have read the Unified Modeling Language Users Guide written by the three amigos: Ivar Jacobson, Brady Booch and James Rumbaugh. You may not completely grasp the sample class diagram from a conceptual or practical point of view but can understand it enough to verify how the stated constraints are valid and well formed. That is you can read the example constraints and verify their correctness by navigating the sample class diagram.Overall I would say that the OCL removes ambiguity from UML models and better states constraints and business rules than visual notations used in UML. I recommend this book and think it can be another notch in an Object-Oriented developers arsenal to offer something more to their software projects and employers."},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"OCL is an attempt to bring a formal method into the &quot;real world&quot; by making the syntax non-mathematical and - in this book - describing and illustrating it in the context of developing a realistic app using UML.The book is short, trustworthy and rewarding - the more you work at it the more you understand, and I only spotted one typo (apart from appendix A.2, which is apparently borrowed from the OMG, and has a few).It makes a compelling case for using OCL to disambiguate the UML, and also supports the (unstated) observation - the paradox of formal methods is that they are highly counter-intuitive to the ordinary application developer, but have the potential to make development much more intuitive by ensuring that software components work as designed, separately and together."},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"This book is a nice introduction, into something with quite some potential.If you've never heard of OCL, and wonder what it's all about, then you definitely need this book.If you have seen OCL before, but you don't have a reference manual, this is also the book you need.If you're looking for a coherent way to use UML and OCL together, then you might want to take a look at 'Object, Components and Frameworks with UML; The Catalysis Approach'."},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"The OCL is a defined, typed grammar for the accurate expression of constraints and rules that will prove very useful in the construction of object-oriented tools and end-user systems.

It seems as if the author did some online research and talked to a couple of people that knew the band.The claim of providing insight into the origination of the songs was almost completely bogus.Even worse was the lack of factual and personal information about Lowell himself. Shoot, if I described the time we spent together and recalled the stories he told me you would have a much better idea as to who he was.I agree with the person that wrote that it is better than nothing, but not by much. Lowell deserves a documentary on film and it is my intent to make one, if it's the last thing I doLastly, I was with Lowell when he wrote \\"Kokomo\\". The song happens to be about me. I never had much of a poker face and Lowell would often laugh at my expressions. He also liked my perfume and knew that I was a friend with many other musicians at the time. Regardless, he knew that he was my best friend and that my loyalty was to him and him alone.He was the best man I've ever known. He had an incredible sense of humor. He was a man of honor and integrity. The wheels were always turning inside his brilliant mind. He read Scientific American Magazine in his spare time and listened to \\"World Music\\" before it was even coined as that.He had an amazing amount of charisma and it was interesting to watch both men and women compete for his attentions. Most anyone that came in contact with him was drawn to him.He was that kind of guy. He was generous and kind, talented and humble. Exuding an absolutely magnetic and magical energy to those around him.It's a real shame that no one realized how sick he was before he went on the road in 1979'. When I saw pictures of him taken a month before he died, I cried. Shaking my head in wonder that those close to him could not see in his face that he was not well. It seemed so obvious, especially when I compared those pictures to ones taken of him 6 months earlier.But sometimes we don't see that which is right in front of us.I promise my documentary will provide considerable more insight, into this amazing and talented individual.I know the band as well and when I contacted them about being involved in his documentary they did not respond. So, sadly they may choose to remain silent. But many of his other friends will be glad to contribute to this project."},{"Title":"Rock and Roll Doctor-Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter, and Founder of Little Feat","review":"I love Lowell Georges music. I love the work that Little Feat did with him at the helm of that great band. I bought this book, like others, because it was about Lowell &amp; his music. It is clear that the author wanted a chance to review every song and every little contribution that Lowell made to them. But I'm not sure that he particularly liked many of the songs. There are a lot of quotes from the Lovin Spoonful alums, and very little from Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, and other names most Feat fans associate with the original Little Feat, and Lowell George. If you are the type of fan that likes to sing along and tap your feat to the great licks, if you have been listening to Little Feat for as long as you can remember, don't buy this book. You'll probably find you favorite song shredded by this complete review of the music you love, by someone who isn't as interested in the sum as he is in the parts. This isn't a biography, it's more like a revisionist history. Lowell should be listened to not picked apart.

Although it's written in what amounts to an academic style, the book is a fairly quick read that touches on important points in George's life. The book should have concentrated as much on George's life as his music giving equal weight to both. His childhood is given the most short shift in the book but this along with the booklet from the Little Feat anthology give fans enough facts to understand something of the conflict going on in the band and to a lesser extent within George himself.What's missing, however, is an examination of what led George to the self destructive behavior that ultimate caused him to meet an untimely death from a heart attack at age 33. Brend uses older interviews with George as well as new ones conducted with those that knew George from his fellow band members in Little Feat to his early collaborators, to try and give us a good portrait of the lead vocalist/slide player/songwriter and his contribution to music. We don't, however, truly get much insight into what motivated George as a person. Also missing is an indepth examination of the often conflicted recording sessions for the major Little Feat albums.We do get a healthy selection of albums that George produced and/or played on by other artists. This often includes albums where George is rumored to have played on them but without any solid proof. Brend's insight as a musician is valuable in understanding what made George's songs so unique and why his vision of Little Feat was so important.Although Little Feat isn't as well remembered as other 70's icons, their music which embraced a variety of styles makes them one of the outstanding bands of the 70's. They might not have hade the audience of The Eagles, Led Zep or The Stones (the latter two bands were huge admirers of George and Little Feat), but their terrific music is well worth tracking down and listening to."},{"Title":"Rock and Roll Doctor-Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter, and Founder of Little Feat","review":"I am a big time Little Feat fan. And I am very happy that Mark Brend took the time to communicate the genius of Lowell George and the talented and badly underatted band known as Little Feat. The details surrounding the music and stylings of each song is incredibly detailed. The bio of Lowell George is fairly interesting as well.However, I would have preferred some more ellaborate quotes from the living band members of Little Feat if not Lowell George himself. I have met the bandmembers and they seem like ery regular guys. I am sure a few ellaborate quotes from Paul Barrere or Billy Payne on what it was like working with Lowell would go a long way to giving this wonderful band some needed publicity as well as showing the world the true legend Lowell George was.In addition, I would have liked to know more about the subject matter and the influences of Lowell's lyrics. What did inspire him to write such gems as Strawberry Flats or Long Distance Love? I will admit Mark Brand gives a good account of the tensions within a rock n roll band that is trying to find its place in the music world. Also, its good that Brand mentions that Little Feat's fan base included such musical heavyweights as the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin.I do thank you very much Mark Brand for putting out a book on Lowell George.

He has written more than thirty non-fiction books.This is a fascinating collection of eight short stories, each featuring his late-nineteenth-century newspaper reporter hero, Harper. They held my interest to the end.Harmon is a skilled writer, and I look forward to reading more of his work. He is a yarn spinner of the old school, reminiscent of Samuel Clemens or Booth Tarkington, who revels in story telling for the sake of story telling. A modern troubador. He lives in Lexington, South Carolina where he is well known not only for his writing, but also for his music making with his small folk music band, according to the book's introduction.There are eight short stories in the book, all of which are quickly read and very entertaining. This is a wonderful book to read for your own pleasure, or to give as a gift. I recommend it highly.Joseph Pierre,author of The Road to Damascus and other books."},{"Title":"The Chalk Train & Others Tales: the Harper Chronicles, Volume One","review":"These days, anthologies tend to either be collections of the year's best something-or-other or compilations of literary short stories intended to elevate and edify. Both have their place in the scheme of things, but I suspect I'm not the only one who misses anthologies that contain just good entertainment.If that's the case, may I offer for your amusement a slim little volume of tales by journalist Daniel Elton Harmon and featuring an historical counterpart of the author's by the name of Harper. Mr. Harper is a reporter for the fictitious Columbia, S.C., CHALLENGE in the almost-civilized era of the 1880's. The first compilation of his adventures, THE CHALK TOWN TRAIN & OTHER TALES, is billed as volume one of The Harper Chronicles, and those of us who like nothing better than a rollicking good yarn will be waiting impatiently for volume two.The title story pits Harper against a notorious sociopath, back before such people actually had a diagnosis. \\"The Chalk Town Train\\" is a story of corporate injustice, unadulterated evil and justice administered with more than a touch of irony. Indeed, the purveyance of justice is a recurring theme in the eight stories that comprising the book, with our man Harper using his skill and insight to ferret out the truth, sometimes when no one else can.Mr. Harmon has a superbly deft hand with the short story, and his characters are sharply drawn with a few adept strokes. From first word to last, each of Harper's adventures proceeds without a stumble, and the reader who can stop after reading just one must have a will of iron. His style is crisp and effortless, setting scenes with an economy of language that likely owes much to the author's own career as a journalist.Indeed, the only real flaw in THE CHALK TOWN TRAIN is that it's over too soon, and before the appetite is satisfied."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"After reading two books (number two and three) I'm really hooked to the series about Trevor Joseph. They resemble in some ways Elizabeth Geroge's books about Lynley, or perhaps even more Peter Robinson's about Alan Banks and are recommended for everyone who is a fan of those authors.The title of this book is appropriate, the murder victim the story starts with is a man that has by all accounts been dead for two years. Identity theft is not unknown in mystery novels, but this is a rather innovative one and it doesn't resemble any other plot I've read.This novel is well written and captivating, the characters and the setting seem very realistic. There are details that aren't completely plausible (for example someone who had undergone the surgical procedure that has taken place in the story would have needed lifelong medication and could not have lived the life described) but, honestly, how many stories in this genre are really plausible?The characters are extremely well developed and there is a lot going on in their lives, therefore it is absolutely recommended to read the books in this series in the right order."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"This is not a \\"cozy mystery\\" for reading on a rainy day.

This is the fourth book in the series, and the central character and detective, Trevor Joseph, is one of the reasons for the appeal of these novels. He doesn't fit in smoothly with the all too often depicted craggy, cynical British detective found in many novels. His character's complexity and inner struggles are conveyed subtly and skilfully by Katherine John. In this novel, he struggles between the consolidation of his relationship with Lyn (who has now moved in with him) and his attraction to one of the women from an earlier novel.It is interesting also to see his offsider Peter display a more mellow side as he too develops a tentative relationship with a fellow police member. The plot has lots of interesting twists and turns, and the ending is full of unpredictable surprises, some truly tragic.I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"John is indeed a true writer of mystery and intrigue.

Great setting, interesting comments on social problems, and relationships.The things that made me not like this book more are the following. 1)The killer is obvious. 2)For me was the clincher. In this case, we are supposed to accept that a prisoner who signed up for a clinical trial of an influenza drug instead is taken in for a total face transplant. Umm, hello? Even if you assume that the doctor is stupid and unethical enough to do such a thing, there is NO WAY the data could be used. It would be a criminal offense, and at the very least, could lead to the doctor's being blacklisted and sued for malpractice. Because of this, I couldn't give the book a higher rating. Still, it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"A Week in the Life of NASCAR: A View From Within","review":"A coffe table style book that introduces you to some of the many people that work behind the drivers.

It belongs on the desk of every preacher And if you don't preach yourself consider sending it to your pastor, anonymously if need be. When Untener was assigned to teach homiletics at Saint John's Seminary near Detroit, he began to ask people what they liked and disliked about the homilies they heard. He collected thousands of comments and boiled these down to the 25 that are the heart of this book. Later, as bishop of Saginaw, he began the Saginaw Program: a series of very small groups where his priests and deacons could critique each other's homilies. All of his clergy eventually took part in one or another group, and he took part in them all. Such are the sources for this book. It is clear, concise, practical, impressive. It is short enough to be read at a sitting and important enough to be reread at least every year.. It is to preaching what Strunk's Elements of Style is to writing."},{"Title":"Preaching Better: Practical Suggestions for Homilists","review":"This book is great for those just beginning to preach, those who have had a few classes in homiletics as well as for seasoned preachers. Bishop Untener, in concise, clear, and pointed terms, offers insights into every basic element of homily writing. Busy parish clergy and ministers will find this a great help for improving their preaching."},{"Title":"Preaching Better: Practical Suggestions for Homilists","review":"Bishop Untener goes straight to the heart of what a preacher should be doing. He makes his readers take account of genuine feedback from 'folk in the pew' and offers practical solutions which respond to their comments but which also encourage the preacher to grow, develop and improve.The material is set out in short punchy chapters which are easy to read but difficult to forget. Above all, the reader will come away sharing the author's deep admiration for the flow of God's Word through a well-prepared preacher in full control of a well-prepared homily.This short book can upturn the bad habits of even the most experienced preacher and can teach the novice preacher some early profound principles. I cannot commend it too highly."},{"Title":"Preaching Better: Practical Suggestions for Homilists","review":"A friend of mine recently shared a quote with me which I believe was said by Jimmy Breslin. According to Breslin, the reason Catholic priests cannot preach is because they have never rebelled. Priests are trained to respect authority, not rebel. Breslin, on the other hand has been somewhat of a rebel, as his writings sometimes show, so he may have a point, but it is also a gross overstatement since there are many wonderful Catholic homilists. That being said, there are also many people who are dissatisfied with the preaching in Catholic churches and it is not due to disagreeing with Catholic teaching. It is due to poor preparation. It would be wonderful if all Catholic homilists read at least some of Kenneth Untener's PREACHING BETTER, a solid book about preaching by a beloved and experienced Catholic leader. If rebelliousness makes for a good writer and preacher, then the person of Kenneth Untener would also prove his point.The late Bishop Kenneth Untener was loved by many because of his less than predictable approach to ministry. While he was criticized by some as being too liberal, his life was that of an effective follower of Christ. Everything he did was geared toward the people he served. He did not live in a bishop's house, preferring instead to live in rectories throughout his diocese. This enabled him to be part of the communities he shepherded and listen to the priests of his diocese. From what we know about Jesus Christ, he also traveled from place to place to be part of the community and always knew the needs of his leaders. Not a bad example to follow.If there is one work that could become part of Bishop Untener's legacy, it is PREACHING BETTER. The book is geared toward the Catholic homilist, whether the homilist is a priest, deacon, catechist, or lay preacher, but I am certain that people of other denominations can appreciate his tips and wisdom. The reason I say it is geared toward Catholic preaching is due to the fact that Untener stresses the importance of the homily to the entire liturgy, and acknowledges that some of the sloppy practices that have developed in some Catholic churches stem from a belief that a good homily is nice, but not essential since many Catholics would attend Mass for the Eucharist anyway. He sees a clear connection between Eucharist and preaching the Word. He also believes that preaching is a means by which the scriptures can still be living and vital today. He gives suggestions for self review but also encourages preachers to have people who will critique homilies. He acknowledges that many people in Catholic ministry can have hectic preaching schedules between Sunday Masses, daily Mass, weddings, funeral, and other occasions that require a homily, but does not believe that so many demands are an excuse for poor preaching.There are a number of wonderful homiletic books available, and many have been penned by experts in preaching and public speaking. For me, Untener's book does not have the expertise of some of the books that are available, but this is not a criticism since this volume has what many of these books lack. Untener's observations and hints seem to be based on his own ministry, his successes and his failures, and his desire to be an effective preacher."},{"Title":"Preaching Better: Practical Suggestions for Homilists","review":"This book is a quick and easy read, filled with countless useful suggestions and tips.

To the military specialist or enthusiast, however, this book is awesome for its rarefied intellectual standard.This book traces the development of total war beginning with Machiavelli (1469- 1527). A battery of the greatest minds and ruthless men follows, such as Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Clausewitz, Adam Smith, Engels and Marx, General Foch, Lenin, Stalin, Mahan and ends with Hitler. Bibliographical notes for every chapter show each author's deep learning. The constellations must have been aligned right in 1943 that 20 brilliant scholars should write as one. Although an updated edition in 1986 has only reprinted 3 of the original chapters, this original classic on total war will continue to be valued for generations. You will cherish it, get it while you can."},{"Title":"Makers of Modern Strategy: Military Thought from Machiavelli to Hitler","review":"Although written soon after the Second World War and therefore a little dated and superceded by a revised edition by Peter Paret, the subject areas covered still have value and interest for the military historian in tracing the development of military thought beyond Jomini and Clausewitz.

Mrs. Durr talks about how she began to question the ideas of white supremacy and Southern Traditions that she was brought up with. She mentions her brother in law Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black and other Washington politicos such as Harold Ickes, and Eleanor Roosevelt that she met over the years.She tells of how redbaiting damaged the fight for civil rights and how the red scare which started under Truman and helped to create McCarthy paralyzed America.Although Mrs. Durr was happy about the abolition of segregation, she knew that integration didn't solve all of America's problems and that America is still divided by race and class."},{"Title":"Outside the Magic Circle: The Autobiography of Virginia Foster Durr","review":"The \\"magic circle\\" in the title refers to the innate social advantage that a person receives simply by not being born as a person of color.

And stepping outside the circle meant not only losing white privilege, but also incurring the considerable familial, social, and economic stigma attached to violating \\"the Southern way of life.\\"Durr (1903-1999) moved comfortably among the big names and small fry, white and black, of the civil rights movement. On a more mundane level, somehow she managed room, board, and laundry services for a husband, five children, and a hoard of Freedom Riders and other protesters coming south to participate in the movement. Her most public moment occurred in 1954 when she was subpoenaed to appear before the Eastland subversive-activities subcommittee. She made the front pages of newspapers nationwide by sarcastically powdering her nose in front of the befuddled Eastland, instead of testifying.This is an in-the-trenches, behind-the-scenes look at not only the civil rights movement but also the last most overt ramifications of the Peculiar Institution."},{"Title":"Portugus Contemporneo II (Portugues Contemporaneo 2) (Portuguese Edition)","review":"This books is great for beginners.

I would hope that Thomas Rabbitt one day wins this award as well. Since 1975, Rabbitt has published some of the best poetry in America. He is not a networker, nor a political activist; he just writes very, very good poems. The difficulty ranges from very accessible to the allusive and occasionally obscure. The poems are usually in a controlled, quiet voice, but with a fierce passion for his subject underlying the poems. And he has a fierce allegiance to the truth, wherever that leads him in a poem. What is often MISSING in hastily written and hastily published poems by writers who spend a great deal of time networking, is MEMORABLE language. Not so with these poems. Poetry should be at least as good as good prose (fiction and nonfiction). His poems meet that test always. The subjects range from everyday experience to historical personae and art. They take place in Boston, Alabama, Iowa, and most recently Ireland. Like a number of other good poets, such as R. T. Smith, some of his best work has occurred during years lived in Ireland. Aspiring poets should also take note of this book for another reason. Much of his best work was written in his forties and fifties -- contrary to common thought, or perhaps to much experience by others, the Muse does not leave us forlorn after age 30. While he is not of any particular school, he has written many fine poems in the sonnet form. He is a worthy heir to his early influences, and in some cases teachers, such as Randall Jarrell, Richard Hugo, and Robert Lowell. While not a networker, he contributed much to the world of poetry in the U.S. by founding and directing the MFA program at the University of Alabama, from which he is now retired. A number of these reviews are quite long, so maybe Amazon will allow me to quote one poem in its entirety, as the best advertisement of this fine book. At a 30% discount for a HARDBACK book, this book is also quite a bargain. I have had poems of my own published in the Antioch Review, the North American Review, and elsewhere, so I feel qualified to recommend this book to you without reservation. Here is one of the poems:WATERSKIING THROUGH MIDDLE AGEMy boat surging away pulls you out and up.In the cove behind us your lovely daughter Mary,Tan, blonde and supple as a perfect lung, shouts.She's sliding the long waterfall down to the beach.Who knows what visitations we have missed?You lift your left foot, drop that ski, balanceEverything.

One of those \\"I should read this but will get to it one day\\" books. When I knew the movie was coming out, I picked up and read ... and read ... and read. I now understand why Tolkien is considered a master of the English language. He has a unique nack of creating this world and bringing you in to it like you were there. I would put Tolkien down as one of my favorite authors now along with Dostovesky and Jane Austen. In a way that Dostevesky takes a reader into the psyche of his characters and Miss Austen into the manners of her day, Tolkien takes the reader into a world that you don't want to leave."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have to admit hesitating when person after person told me to read The Lord of the Rings. Finally, I bought the book and just read it, and there are few books as written as well as this.I had to, however, not give it the 5 stars it surely deserves because it can be a tough read. It's an old book, so the prose is &quot;dated.&quot; It can also be very historical at times, delving into pasts far from the present, and never to be spoken of again.But THAT'S what makes this such an engrossing tale...the histories. Everything from Bilbo's songs to the story of Strider's sword add to each beings personality and give them a life that few modern writers can achieve.And the images Tolkien can conjure span many generations and are as individual as the person reading it. He gives enough information of the Shire and Rivendale and Bree and everywhere else to form an idea, but not so much so that he corners you into seeing what the next person sees. The many interpretations of Frodo himself are testement to this.If you want something to read in two days, grab a Brooks novel, if you want something you can read again and again and get something new from it each time, I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the best book in the trilogy. It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.(...) Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.This is the best book Tolkien has ever written.This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am young and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece.

It was my second time and I think it is my favorite part of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Some of my favorite incidents happen here from, &quot;An Unexpected Party,&quot; where many a Hobbit gather for Bilbo's farewell party to, &quot;At the Sign of The Prancing Pony,&quot; a visit to a busy inn in the Hobbit town of Bree. Also, the chapters, \\"Many Meetings,\\" and, \\"The Council of Elrond,\\" are rare times of joy and rest where many different races meet for the Council of Elrond. Then, of course, there are the climatic chapters, \\"A Journey in the Dark,\\" and, \\"The Bridge of Kazad-dum.\\" and, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\"What I like about the novel is this is where one learns the background of the tale; where did the Ring come from, what does it do and where has it been all these centuries? Tolkien creates a feeling that FOTR stands in a long tradition; the world of the novel is already thousands of years old by the time we visit it. After one finishes the entirety of the Lord of the Rings, \\"The Silmarillion,\\" provides the creation myth and the ancient history of the Elves and the other races of Middle-Earth; Tolkien worked on it his whole life.There is also a great feeling of ambience; from the way Tolkien describes geography to the description of buildings and the physical description of characters. On a deeper level, one has the feeling that the current age is about to set and another age is about to rise. The mysterious, powerful, joyous Elves of old are about to fade away and leave Middle-Earth (where Tolkien set his story) forever and Men will takeover and so begin the Fourth Age.The story is suspenseful, as the small company of Hobbits sets out from their sheltered homeland called the Shire to far off Rivendell, just west of the Misty Mountains. All along the way, they are followed by the Black Riders who seek to recover the Ring from Frodo (the Hobbit who carries it) and return it to its evil Master. At times, Frodo is tempted to use the power of the Ring even though he knows that it is evil. At Bree, the company meets with Strider; who wears&quot;[a] travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a good that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.&quot;They all journey to Rivendell, where the many tales of old are told and the Council of Elrond is called to decide the fate of the Ring. The decision is made and a Fellowship made to guide Frodo; Merry, Sam, Pippin (his original Hobbit companions), Legolas (an Elf of Mirkwood), Gimli (a Dwarf of the Lonely Mountain), Boromir (Man of Gondor), Strider, and Gandalf the Grey (a wizard) set out with Frodo. They set out to cross the Misty Mountains, but defeated by snow and weather, decide to turn back and enter the Mountain. The Mountain used to be a grand palace of Dwarves and is sung of in their songs.I can only encourage you to read this book before the movie comes out. While the movie does look quite good, novel-film conversion is never perfect and the book is better than the film nearly every time, so read the book first. I set a goal to re-read the entire epic before the films arrive."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I agree that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I will not say that I disagree with so-and-so's review on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing. And I am looking forward to the movie, it really does look amazing!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's novel titled, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; is the first book of the, &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; trilogy. The trilogy picks up where Tolkien's novel, &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; left off. Tolkein has a great imagination that is evident in his writing. He creates the fictional land called Middle Earth. The land is filled with dwarves, elves, humans, and hobbits. Hobbits are hairy creatures about half the size of humans. Hobbits enjoy simple lives but are capable of great feats and courage if they are pushed to it. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; tells the story of some extraordinary hobbits.Frodo is hobbit that lives in Hobbiton. Gandalf, an important and powerful wizard, gives Frodo the responsibility of caring for a special ring. The ring makes the wearer invisible, but it seems to have an evil affect on people. After many years, Gandalf discovers the true power of the ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that the ring is called the, &quot;One Ring.&quot; The ring was created long ago and holds much power. Gandalf has also learned of an evil force trying to retrieve the ring. Sauron, the Dark Lord, is searching for the ring. If Sauron reaches the ring, he will control the Middle Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that the the ring must be destroyed, and it can only be destroyed at the Mountain of Fire. Frodo decides to make the lengthy journey along with three other hobbit friends to destroy the ring.Along the journey, the hobbits come across many different people and dangers. Middle Earth is filled with many different types of creatures. Some are good, and some are evil. It is clear that Tolkien spent much time thinking about the land called Middle Earth. The characters are well developed and are easy to relate with. It is interesting to read about all the cities, creatures, and people in Middle Land. I am a slow reader, and I usually get aggrivated with books over 400 pages. However, I really enjoyed this book, and I plan to finish the trilogy when I get the time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Hobbits are funny little fat people with hair on their feet. They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves. They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance. These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo. Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.Frodo exits his homeland pursued by Furies: Nine undead kings mounted upon great black stallions. These Dark Riders have supernatural power and homicidal intent: they will find and destroy Frodo and restore the ring to its &quot;rightful&quot; owner, Sauron the Dark Lord.Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers: Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.The company meets exotic friends, confronts implacable foes, and surmounts daunting obstacles to move Frodo closer to accomplishing his important mission. This first volume of the trilogy ends with the quest seemingly in shambles, but remember there are two more volumes to come.Many have imitated, but none have equaled Tolkien's fairy tale for adults. I wish, however, that he'd left out most of those songs and poems. The best poems were merely mediocre, while the worst were awful. Early on I started skipping the poetry whenever I came to it. It didn't detract at all from my ability to follow the story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I first read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Science class when I was twelve years old. Perhaps this explains why I do not like science (or its evil twin sister...math) and why I have never stopped reading. Recently, I have started rereading the trilogy. It is amazing how much seems new to me after all these years.The beginning of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings,&quot; is an enticing feast to begin with. It picks up years after the ending of Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The story begins with the coming again of Gandalf to, and the departure of Bilbo from the Shire. It then moves forward into telling about Bilbo's nephew Frodo and the magic ring Bilbo leaves him.As events are set in motion, Frodo flees his peaceful home in the Shire. He and a fellowship of others are commissioned with destroying the magical ring...which they are informed is the most powerful tool of evil ever created...the One Ring. The great problem they face is trying to figure out how they will march straight into the heart of the enemy's power to the only place it can be destroyed.I am amazed at the eloquent power of Tolkien's writing. As a child, I was only concerned by the action of the plot (and there is plenty of action and suspense here). Now that I am a little bit older, I am blown away by the depth of these books. Tolkien's creation--the world of Middle Earth is a masterpiece. These stories are filled with poetry and legends from the past ages of middle earth. This depth makes the tale of the Ring breathe with life and wonder.The characters are even more fascinating than the journeys they go on. Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn are my favorites so far; although I really like the developing friendship between Gimli and Legolas.I can't wait to read the rest of the stories. I highly recommend &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I'll be the first to admit that the pace of the novel meanders a bit, and the action is spread far between the chapters, but regardless I found myself completely at the mercy of Tolkien's magic.

There you'll be introduced to Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who finds the ring that is the catalyst for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also the great wizard Gandalf who figures prominently in &quot;...Fellowship.&quot; It's seems so obvious now that modern masters of the fantasy genre such as Robert Jordan got so much of their inspiration from Tolkein. The edition I read also included a map so it was easy to chart the journey of Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo as he headed towards his dark destination. The story is simple, at the heart being the struggle to destroy a ring forged by a powerful evil that in the hands of it's maker would spell doom for everyone.I know some people felt it slow moving, and I don't totally disagree, but I loved it all the same. Can't wait to read the next two, and see the movie this December."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"If you like adventure and excitment then you will love The Fellowship of The Ring. It's about a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who has a magic ring that can turn the person wearing it invisible. Frodo gets the ring from his uncle (Bilbo Baggins from the hobbit fame)who took it from Smeagol(also known as Gollum). Frodo is going to Mt.Doom,the center of Sauron's dark castle, to destroy the ring. Sauron is an evil wizard who wants the ring for himself. I recommend this book because of its strong wording and imaginative new and old characters. It had very good descriptions and a lot of adventure and excitment,but to me, no book is perfect. To all you adults out there who don't think I know what I'm talking about,(being I'm a kid) go to the library,check it out, and just see what a great book it really is! So go,go,go,go!

Tolkien certainly had a large imagination. I was emotionally attached to all the characters, for they were so well developed and the writing is quite wonderful. Being a Christian writer, J.R.R.

It is a delightful combination of poetry, lovable characters, beautiful descriptive writing, and adventure. Tolkien is an incredible wordsmith and paints beautiful (or terrifying) pictures of scenery, from the clouds in the sky to the grass on the ground. The reader can see the forests, the mountains, the rivers, even the clothing worn by the characters. The characters in this story are diverse and fascinating, coming from different races, speaking different languages, but all having a common purpose and a profound friendship. Frodo, a hobbit, the humblest of all creatures, is chosen to embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring, the greatest instrument of evil known to Middle Earth. Together with eight other companions, they begin the first leg of their heroic journey to Mount Doom."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I read this way back when I was an undergraduate student at Bradley University. A friend of mine had given me the trilogy. I was an avid Bradley basketball fan and had gone to every home game up to the time that I received the three book set.Well, I got so enchanted that I missed the weekend game and finished all three books in several days.

If you like a fast paced plot and lots of action, this is not for you. If you like to savor the moment, you will absolutely fall in love as I did.Tolkien takes you step by step and describes EVERY step. His dialogue is simple natured and simply put which adds a hint of humor in and of itself. The plot is profound. It deals with fighting evil through friendship, loyalty, and tradition. There's food, dancing, poetry, storytelling, magic, tragedy, adventure, suspense and humor. I liked reading this in the wee morning hours when the world was quiet and when Tolkien's detailed accounts would draw me into Middle Earth. Yes, the story could have survived with less scenery descriptives, but I believe it would have been different. I believe there is something to be gained from savoring the moments in a story and Tolkien does it beautifully. The characters and settings linger in my mind which says something to me."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I read this trilogy in high school and was captivated by the \\"Middle Earth\\" universe created by Tolkien. The book has lost some of its popularity, and I have been unable to get my children (captivated instead by Harry Potter) to read it. The excellent movie version of Lord of the Rings has helped a bit in restoring the book to its proper cultural status. The audio CD version of this makes the book very digestible, and the reader (Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis) is excellent.In re-reading this first volume 35 years later, I am struck by the vulnerability of good and the primacy of evil in Tolkien's universe. It is no accident that the standard bearers for good are brave little hobbits; good is a distinct underdog in this world.The triumph of good against all odds is our most basic human myth, and Tolkien tells this oldest of stories in a fresh and entertaining fashion. I suppose that Harry Potter is the updated version of Tolkien, but try to get your kids to read Tolkien as his telling of the myth is unrivaled."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This has been a perennial personal favorite of mine since I first read it in the 1970s. I don't know how many times I've read it since then, but a conservative guess would be at least a dozen times. I just finished reading it again last weekend - it was once again, outstanding!So, what should you know if you are pondering your first foray into Tolkien's tale of Middle Earth? Lets see...1) \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" done not include a complete stand-alone tale. It is, rather, the first book of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy which also includes the volumes \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\". So, when you get to the end of this volume you are left hanging there...you MUST get the other two books to complete the tale. (That's what happened to me when I read this book the first time [as an assignment for a college English class I was taking])2) This is a classic tale of good versus evil, but, as you can read in the forward, Tolkien states that it is not meant to be an allegory; it is just a tale that he wanted to tell.3) Be prepared to have your traditional views of what an elf, wizard, etc., are to be challenged.4) This book can be enjoyed by readers of many ages. I read it first when I was in college, and, later, when I had children of my own I read this trilogy to them while they were in elementary school (one was even a pre-schooler - that was years before the movies of the same names were released).5) There is no objectionable language in the books, though many parts convey a dark image of a world under the sway or impending threat of evil.6) You do not have to read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" before reading this book. And I found this trilogy to be far superior to \\"The Hobbit\\" when I did read it.At first I wondered at the Amazon-indicated reading level of 9-12 yrs for this book. I would not have guessed that when I first read it, but now that I have children of my own that have consumed the entire \\"Harry Potter\\" series as well as many other long novels, I can see how a 9-12 yr range could work for these books as well...depending on the child. Be aware though, that there are many places in the book where Tolkien's characters launch into sometimes extensive recitation of verse as part of the story. That can put off some younger readers (I sometimes skip over those parts myself...though that may offend some Tolkien purists out there)If you have children that like books like \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"Eragon\\", etc., and they are looking for a new adventure, you might suggest this one to them. I have read the \\"Harry Potter\\" books, and if I were to compare them to Tolkien's works I have to say that Tolkien's story conveys a richer image of a world to me than do the books of JK Rowling (though I also enjoyed them).All in all, this book launches a top-flight story and represents what I consider to be the prototypical modern fantasy story - \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"Definitely 5 stars (only because I can't award more)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien was the master of fantasy, and that's not just because he was the first to write a very popular modern epic.What makes Tolkien superior was how he used his extensive knowledge of mythology and linguistics to create his own complex world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College where he studied and taught the linguistics of early English. Over many years he created his own elvish language with a complex syntax and grammar, and a complete history and mythology of Middle Earth (see the twelve volumes of The Histories of Middle-Earth below.) This gives his works so much complexity and texture that when you read them, you feel like you've dropped into the middle of a real civilization.Besides the amazing world-building, Tolkien builds excellent characters and uses them to explore such heavy human themes as friendship, love, greed, power, redemption, gender-roles, self-sacrifice, and death. This is not a light epic for a Sunday afternoon. This is intense, bone-chilling, goose-bump raising stuff. You can feel the weight of the world on the shoulders of Frodo and his companions. And, though there's a happy ending, it comes with much suffering and loss.And all the while, Tolkien's writing is beautiful and poignant. In my opinion, the only writers I've read who even begin to compare are Ursula LeGuin, Susanna Clarke, and perhaps Lois McMaster Bujold.~FantasyLiterature.net"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It would have helped if I read the Hobbit first.This book had a depth, I had never read before. The complexity of Middle Earth was astounding to the 11 year old boy who first read this book.

The question has lasted for twenty years and since the world is standard of good literature or simply fun with words then I will contribute my opinion.You are most likely familiar with the Harry Potter series, and it is the perfect example of a child's tale. J.R.R. Tolkien studied the language of our past and used it to write his story, and as you know their form of language, the early english written tradition, has proven not to be useless long sentences and foolish puns,(hint:Shakespeare),the context is so full of language and wit it would be an insult to call it a child's tale.

The author is J.R.R. Tolkien. His writing style is very unique. This book is the first in a trilogy of three.The book is about a young hobbit named Froto Baggins. He has inherited a ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. Little does Froto know what perils this ring will bring him. So he is set out to destroy the ring before it is too late. Froto sets out with nine others to bring evil to an end once and for all. If the ring is not destroyed they all will be destroyed.This would be a book well worth your while to read.

I personally enjoyed this book and finished it in less than week. The story follows this theme, \\"Three rings for the Eleven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne, In the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\\" The story begins with Frodo the little hobbit, who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. Unfortunately, he learns from his friend, Gandalf the Wizard, that the ring is extremely evil, and wants to get back to his master, The dark Lord Sauron. Then starts the adventure of the Hobbit, who goes on a journey with a few companions to the only place where the ring can be destroyed, the Cracks of Doom in the fiery mountain Orodruin, inside Sauron's realm of Mordor. Chased by evil that does not sleep, this book gives you more than just entertainment, it also throws in some values and other ideas, like friendship, loyalty, courage, respect for one another. J.R.R Tolkiens did a great job developing the characters, and I recommend this book to the fans, but also to those who don't know Tolkiens, because this is a true piece of art, and also the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is soo awesome! I have not yet finished reading it but it has a great beginning! Every part is so interesting and it makes me want to read more!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I've read the Lord of the Rings at least two dozen times or more, and it is far and away my favorite book of all time. Although each time I've re-read it I have gotten yet more and more out of it, listening to this unabridged reading has made me appreciate the work even more, if possible. Listening to it without the printed page before your eyes renders everything so much more vividly it is truly astonishing. It also modulates the pacing of the experience, since it takes longer to read aloud than to read silently in your head. And you can appreciate the nuances of Tolkien's elegant and stately prose style so much more this way, too.Rob Inglis's reading is wonderful. His vocal characterizations are excellent, particularly for Gollum, Treebeard, Gimli and Gandalf. His emotional range is a bit narrow, unfortunately, and some of his intonations can be a bit repetitive or occasionally off, but this does not really detract from the whole. An especially nice thing is that he actually sings each of the songs that are interspersed throughout the story. I don't know where the melodies came from, but they are very fitting, with a sort of English folk-music style that fits in perfectly with the ambience of the whole.Listening to these CD's has been absolutely delightful in every way. I am going to be so, so sad when I get to the end, I must just turn right around and start them over again!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is a true classic,and it\`s popularity is enormous.And why,you could easily understand when you read it. I would be surprised if there exists any person who hasn\`t heard of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or J.R.R.Tolkien.The plot is a true classic,which has inspired a huge number of other books and movies (among them Star Wars and The Wheel of Time). 19 rings were once made. Nine for the mortal men,seven for the dwarf kings,and three for the elven kings. But the Dark Lord Sauron also created his own ring - The Lord of the Rings,whose power will make good into evil because of temptation!The nine mortal men where once mighty kings,but became Sauron\`s servants by temptation.Sauron was finally defeated by a human named Isildur(though his spirit continued living in the shadows),but then he also became evil when he took the ring. Later,the ring took his own life and he dropped it into the river,where it remained undiscovered for 3000 years.Thousands of years later,the hobbits (a kind of small people) wants to live in peace,and having nothing to worry about. One of the older hobbits,Bilbo Baggins,cheated himself the almighty ring from a creature named Gollum,and suddenly,the servants of the dark lord finds out where the ring is. Bilbo leaves the ring to his relative Frodo. The wizard Gandalf decides that the ring has to be destroyed - that\`s the only way to defeat Sauron forever. Frodo later becomes the leader for The Fellowship of the Ring,which consists of four hobbits (Frodo,Sam,Merry and Pippin),the wizard Gandalf,the two humans Aragorn (or Strider)and Boromir,the elve Legolas and the dwarf Gimli.And I think most of you recognize those characters,so I don\`t have to explain in detail who they are. The fellowship is now thrown into a fantastic adventure,where they have to meet a thousand dangers on their way to Mount Doom.What amazes me mostly with this book is how complex the world is. And imagine Tolkien has found out all of it himself!He really must have had a lot of fantasies!But this isn\`t just some wild imaginations - because the world feels so complex,it is so real you can believe it really has existed. He creates detailed cultures for each of the people in his Middle Earth,like comparisons between different religions today. Over all,the world is similar to the medieval Europe,but with fantasy creatures like dragons as well.As Tolkien was an expert of Nordic mythology,he also figured out the names like Frodo,Bilbo and Gandalf very easily. And The Middle Earth is actually an english translation from the Swedish Midgard,which was the place where the humans lived in the nordic mythology. That could be interesing to know.Many people claims the book is too short - and sometimes,I do agree. A hundred pages more would not have been a bad idea.Over all,this is a difficult book to review,because there is always something that remains incomplete.Now the book has been made into a film,which is one of the most popular today,but before you see the film,I recommend you to read the book. It\`s not enough having seen just the film and skip the book. You have to read it to really understand the whole complexity of Tolkien\`s world.The three books are all in all like one great adventure,but this is my favorite,because it is the most classical and introduces us to the Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This narration is tremendous! It is COMPLETE and not overdone with stupid special effects or a whole cast of characters. Rob Inglis has the most wonderful voice and creates all of the characters as though they were in the room with you. He makes you feel like you're cudled in front of the fire in the House of Elrond listening to tales of old lore. I can honestly say that my favorite part of the day, the part I look forward to all day, is the half an hour before bed when I listen to these CDs. It's strange to say that a set of CDs brings you closer to inner peace...but I dare say that if any could do that, these are among their number."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is beautiful and rich in texture, character development, and writing style, and in my opinion transcends the realm of \\"book\\" and \\"fantasy\\", becoming true literature and a classic. The book should not be confused with the movie, as the two are aimed at different audiences with different expectations. Fellowship is without a doubt dated. As some reviewers have pointed out, Tolkien may spend 80 pages walking down a road, or 2 pages in a song. He may spend pages developing a character's style, then mere paragraphs describing an action scene. Tolkien wrote to a British audience back in the 30s and 40s who didn't mind this and actually expected it. An audience who were not as rushed as we are today, who did not expect the instant gratification TV and computers bring and were used to pure imagination to visualize action scenes. An audience who had 2 or 3 hours a night to become absorbed in a book and who were willing to put forth the sustained effort to delve into complex character development. The movie in turn is geared towards maximum action and gratification in a short time period. There's nothing wrong with that; in fact I think the movie is brilliant, a visual feast. But that is not, nor can it be, the aim of the book. The point of this book is to close yourself off to the real world and lose yourself entirely in Tolkien's fantasy. If a sentence has to be reread a couple of times, or only 20 pages are read in an hour or two, than so be it. This is not a novel to be rushed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I think this is a great book.

The Fellowship of the Rings is the first of the Lord of the Rings trilogy (The Hobbit being an opening to the series) and tells the story of the One Ring falling into the hands of Frodo the Hobbit. He learns soon after that Sauron, the Dark Lord, is in pursuit of the One Ring and thus Frodo must destroy it to save Middle Earth. The story itself is written well with intense diction and imagery that creates a living-breathing world. Each chapter is jammed with interesting information and action that keeps you turning page after page.

Tolkien, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, would have to be my favorite book in three ways. To begin with, there is a tremendous amount of action in this book. For example, Frodo, the main character, and all of his companions set out to destroy an evil ring so the evil Sauron won't get his nasty hands on it. If they don't destroy the ring, all of Middle Earth would be doomed. They must battle their way to Mount Doom to cast the ring into its flames. But, there are many enemies on their way like, Sauroman, orcs, and Ring Wraiths. Secondly, I like how Tolkien brings Middle Earth to life by describing it so deeply. For example, I like how he describes The Mines of Moria so well. Last but not least, I love the fantasy and magic in this book. For instance, Gandalf, a great wizard, has many spells and magical powers. If you do not like fantasy, you shouldn't read this book; but if you do this book is spectacular! In conclusion, if you are looking for a great book, get The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R.

Whenever I got to a long and boring description, I put the book down for a week and then made myself struggle through it. Maybe if I were a little older it would've been easier to read.

To learn about what the Lord of the Rings is about, please look elsewhere.I have owned the books for many years, I own a dramatization of the books on CD called &quot;The Lord of the Rings (Mind's Eye Version)&quot; and now I bought this version. I was doubtful at first if I should spend the money to basically buy something I already owned twice - I didn't regret it for one second.Rob Inglis (the narrator), a recognized Shakespeare actor, is doing an outstanding job on these 16 CDs (and there are 30 more for the next two books), each with more than 1 hour of playtime and divided into tracks of approx. 3 minutes each. His reading style, using distinctly different voices for each character without any additional sound effects or music, draws you very deeply into Tolkiens world.

I would highly recommend reading The Hobbit first because there are too many references in Fellowship that won't make sense unless you do.For those considering reading the book before seeing the movie - I would recommend this. The movie was great and fairly accurate but left out many interesting details. Also, in rare form, the movie does add some to the book as it is more dramatic and slightly embellished in some places.For those who have read the book but not seen the movie - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There's irony in the aspersions cast against The Fellowship of the Ring. The criticisms most often raised- that its pace founders, that its heroes and villains are vapid, that its prose is effete- simply take a fractured view on the book's greatest merits.Such criticism is symptomatic of our age: Tolkien's pacing incenses readers reared on cartoon adventures, on entertainment calculated to induce adrenaline rushes each instant; Tolkien dares to paint characters unequivocally good or evil, anathema to a society that wonders whether the World Trade Center should still stand; nor does Tolkien condescend to the reader- he renders his epic through epic language. To a culture whose conception of male relationships is a duo of sitcom characters slinging insults and competing for females, the Fellowship's comradeship and nobility, even the genuine love among its members, is a jarring anachronism, but a welcome one.If this review smacks of falsehood, I'll concede that logical gaps should be expected in an argument for a book that I decided was the best ever written while in the first grade. I read Lord of the Rings again recently, though, and my admiration for the book soared. Its author insists that he meant for the tale to stand on its own merits, that it offered no commentary on World War II or on religion, and it does so commendably. It does more, however- it suggests on every page the transience of existence, that all things, beautiful and plain, strong and feeble, must give way to the new.Tolkien's Middle Earth, styled with abundant implications for our own world, nonetheless exists self-sufficiently. No book can boast of a factitious reality so unflinchingly realized. Every song, every sunset, every smoke-ring completes Tolkien's envisaged world, and brilliantly intensifies the conflict. Through profuse detail, we learn exactly what odds face the Fellowship, and what lies at stake. Each step on the journey, then, and each battle acquires gravity unattainable to a tale less completely realized. The opening chapters and subsequent exposition are not impediments to the conflict ahead- they, rather, are integral to it.The Fellowship of the Ring and its companion volumes could imbue all humanity with pride in their nobility. We instead seethe against its idealism. Lord of the Rings becomes, curiously, an exclusionary book. It has nothing to say to post-modernists who find perverse vindication in depictions of people as frail as they. It offers nothing to self-hating intellects who equate &quot;human&quot; with &quot;impotent,&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot; with &quot;delusion.&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings expertly lends us a view of life as one ought to live it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As LOTR regularly wins polls as the twentieth century's favorite work of fiction, it is now rather difficult to say anything new about it, except that professors of English who appear on highbrow chat shows to review literature rather reprehensibly still prefer 'realists' of the Thomas Hardy and George Eliot ilk. Chronologically (in Middlearth time and in order of publishing), 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the first book of the great Lord of the Rings trilogy and follows 'The Hobbit'. Of course The Hobbit itself is largely aimed at children, although the themes mature as the story matures, whereas LOTR is four-squarely adult. However, it should be realised that Hobbit is essentially, as Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis put it, 'merely a fragment torn from the author's huge myth'. The inchoate romance of the whole of Middlearth and its inhabitants came into being over a very long period, and formed a superlatively coherent whole well before he thought of publishing.As an heroic romance, the book was launched into a post-war Britain that largely expected fiction to be a 'slice of reality', as in the Hardy/Eliot tradition. We had turned our back on books of this type. So far as romances of imagined worlds, real heroes, real villains, and epic themes went the science fiction sub-culture of dime novels and cheap comics was the brightest spot on the literary horizon! All the greater the shock then, when this luxuriously and profligately original masterwork, a veritable new Odyssey, re-established the genre at a stroke.The story starts quietly, and even a little childishly, in the Shire of the hobbits, who are quite English and very much the sort of creation that an Englishman of the Midlands would create, although they are not an allegory of the English (I speak as a Midlander). Events rapidly gather pace and the serious and high nature of the quest becomes apparent, the great master-ring created by Sauron being in the seemingly accidental possession of one Frodo Baggins, hobbit-at-large. The Ring is too terrible a weapon to be mastered for good and used against Sauron, yet the Lord of the Rings is utterly set on claiming it back. Therefore, hard though the thought is, the weapon that is the Ring must be destroyed. A trusty band, a fellowship, of adventurers must be assembled to carry out the quest. There are many subtleties in this book, and the characters are not all they seem. The heroes of the fellowship have mixed motives, Boromir especially. The climax of the Fellowship of the Ring largely revolves around the chaos caused by the Boromir's inner dilemma and his unwise actions. Even Gollum the sneak is not yet entirely bad and has the occasional good impulse. As if the Black Riders and hordes of orcs were not bad enough the story breaks off with a classical cliff-hanger, as the quest must go on even though the fellowship be riven by argument and conflict. As the plots and sub-plots multiply so does the tension. A must read?, to be sure. More than once, certainly. But not before the next two installments..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"In this sequel to The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins's favorite nephew Frodo inherits his uncle's magic ring when Bilbo leaves to go off on his last adventure. Years later, Bilbo and Frodo's friend Gandalf, a powerful and wise wizard, comes along to tell him the tragic, horrifying story of the ring. He tells Frodo that many ages ago, the Dark Lord Sauron forged the One Ringto rule over 19 other magic rings used for good that were still in existence. The ring has slipped from hand to hand throughout the years before it came to Gollum, who Bilbo took it from. Sauron had recently started madly searching for his ring so that he could use it to rule all of Middle-Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that he and his friends must set out and take the ring to Mount Doom, the volcano in which it was created, and throw it in to unmake it for good. I would strongly recommend The Fellowship of the Ring to anyone willing to take the time to read it and has previously read The Hobbit. It does get dull in some places, but soon speeds up. The story is enthralling and thouroughly enjoyable. Tolkien has a wonderful way of using the English language to pull the reader in. You should definately at least give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I am not one who usually buys books-on-tape (or CD as in this case) but I have long wanted to obtain the Lord of the Rings so as to hear this incredible story over and over. After having read it several times, my book is in tatters and so I searched for an unabridged audio recording. Many of those that I have seen claim to be &quot;unabridged&quot; but the fact is that they are not complete! They give parts of the books in full but leave out many sections or chapters. This set by Rob Inglis is COMPLETE!!! It is very well read with no drastic voicing of characters. Characters are easily distinguished and thoroughly enjoyable. This set is not full of sound effects and music, so if you are looking for that this is not for you. However, I personally prefer the fact that this is not an over-production and is rather quite focussed on what I wanted in the first place, the characters and the story. Inglis does a marvelous job and I am very happy with this set. Again, not to harp on it but, this is a &quot;complete&quot; package well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is truly a wonderful story , But I was unsure of getting the cd over the audio tapes. I noticed that the tapes had the Unabridged version and the Cd version did not say if it was or not on all parts, so i took a chance and got the Cd version of each book. Thankfully the Cd version Is also Unabridged. So for those of you out there like me who might have been confused between the tapes and the Cd now you know they are the same."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"In my review of Rob Inglis' reading of The Hobbit, I said it seemed to take me a little while to get into his vocalizations, even though I'm a big fan of audio books (especially those read by a British voice).The Fellowship of the Ring, however, I fell in love with immediately. Rob Inglis' style is perfect for this book. He does the voices well and the story is far richer and more engrossing than that of The Hobbit. (Even though The Hobbit is delightful and unique in its own right.)There really isn't much I can say about these Lord of the Rings audio books that hasn't already been said. This CD edition of The Fellowship of the Ring read by Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis is perfect for you if:1. You love The Lord of the Rings2. You're intrigued by all the pre-movie hype and you'd like to discover what Tolkien's book is really all about3. You have a lot of drive time on your hands and you'd like to fill it with something entertaining and intelligent4. You can't stand listening to insipid Top 40 or Talk Radio programs5. You love listening to the British dialect6. You just want to have a good time hearing one of the greatest novels ever written read to you by a professionally trained actor who makes each character come to life.The sound quality on these CDs is, as it was on The Hobbit, superb. The recording level is perfect. The pace of the reading is just right. I'm about halfway through right now and I'm looking forward to every minute of it.This edition is a very good value for the price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Now, this is probably going to be an unpopular review because people will see the three stars and think, &quot;What, is he out of his mind? The Lord of the Rings is one of the best books ever written&quot;. And it is. But this is not a review of the book, it is a review of Rob Inglis' READING of the book. And the editorial raves not withstanding, I am sorry to say that this is not a reader that EVERYONE will like. Before I get lynched, here's why I think so.I have listened to HUNDREDS of audio books. All unabridged. Inglis falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. He has a deep voice -- this would not normally be an issue were he reading a historical work. But Inglis is one of those readers who does &quot;voices&quot;. NOw some people are genius at this. For example, the incomparable Frederick Davidson. But for Inglis, the deep voice is a liability when he tries to pitch it high to do an elf voice or, good heavens, a woman's voice. The result is very annoying.Also, fans of the Trilogy will know that it is filled with song. Inglis' rendering of the songs was grating (at times almost embarassing) -- and got my fast forward finger working over-time. He is over-matched by this, particularly when it comes to Galadriel or Legolas.Next there is the manner, or tone, in which Inglis has chosen to pitch his reading. He has adopted a wistful, elegiac, far away manner -- it is almost pretentious, I have to say. And it becomes tedious because he almost never varies it. He is, as the saying goes, &quot;a bit one paced&quot;. Now, some people will like his voice and manner, I do not deny this -- because it does, as one of the editorial reviews says, emphasize the fairy tale aspect of the Trilogy.But to me is drains some of the manliness and power from some of the dialogue. Aragorn, to me the quintessential man of action and mystery, a true hero, comes across as a man obessesed with what has been lost; a man trapped in the past. Which he clearly isn't.Some examples. Aragorn and Boromir are virtually indistinguishable. The Hobbits (apart from Frodo), Sam in particular, are rendered in a country bumpkin voice that is out of all keeping with what I see as the inherent dignity of the Hobbits. It also serves to underscore Sam as the servant of Frodo, rather than his friend. Legolas ends up with a reedy, strained voice, because Inglis can not get into the higher register. I was left thinking, &quot;who ever made the rule that Elves had little high voices?&quot;HAVING SAID ALL THAT, this is the ONLY unabridged version. And as such, falls into the &quot;must have&quot; category. For all of the foregoing quibbles, Inglis' reading is serviceable and entertaining. Buy it -- you will enjoy it -- but do not expect the definitive reading -- that awaits us! Which is an ocassion for celebration I suppose. Because surely it will come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Writing yet another review of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; is a bit like adding icing to a thousand layer cake. No matter how well written, it is highly unlikely that I could add anything new to the richly deserved kudos that Tolkien's efforts have received in the decades since they first appeared. I have read and re-read these works countless times since I first encountered them when I was in high school, which was back sometime around the invention of fire.I'm not going to even attempt to describe the contents of the volumes other than to state that it is the tale of a great journey and an even greater quest to free the world of a great horror. It shows how there is no such thing as the least or the greatest, and that all have terribly important tasks to do. Tolkien's tale combines fantasy within an ethical and moral framework to create a story that has value for every age group.Over the years, my perception of the books has changed considerably. MY first few readings where in childlike (or hippy-like) wonder, and then, over the years, I have become more conscious of the works as literary efforts and some of the wonder has worn off. But even so one cannot but be amazed by the amount of scholarship and effort that went into making &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; an epic which deeply touches almost everyone who comes into contact with it. On the negative side, though, I found in my latest re-reading that the language seemed a bit more overblown and stilted than I remembered. Unfortunately, that one piece of the gloss had worn off a bit.Recently, looking for some tapes to listen to during a long trip, I came upon this set, narrated by Rob Inglis. It was very nicely priced and just the right length. I decided to discover what it felt like to hear &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; instead of read it. It turned out to be a felicitous decision. The occasional over-formality of the written text seems to vanish when it is read. The tale takes on an entirely different flow, and I found myself much amazed by all the adventures and trials that the four hobbits faced. In a way, the spoken Ring is a completely different work.Rob Inglis does a remarkable job of reading. He manages to produce enough different voices to keep the many speakers separate from each other. I think the reading would have benefited from having additional readers, but Inglis does a fine job nonetheless. Except, unfortunately, when he sings. As much as I enjoyed hearing the many songs of Tolkien for the first time, Rob Inglis is not a singer. He can carry a tune alright, but there is something just a bit unmusical about it. Not enough to detract from the total effect, but enough to cause a wince now and then. Even so, this was a surprisingly enjoyable experience. Recommended to all who seek a different experience of a wonderful old tale."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said in the many, many other reviews? This book is absolutely fabulous. It's full of all the stuff a terriffic novel needs. The characters are complex and intriguing, the plot is fascinating and draws you in so you can hardly put it down. The history given for the world in which the books take place is so extremely detailed and believable, you start to wonder if Middle Earth exsists. Which brings me to another point- the setting is absolutely wonderful, I'd give anything to go to Middle Earth and explore.Sure, it slows down in some spots (the infamous Council of Elrond chapter... ^_-), but for a story to work the plot must slow down in some parts for the author to explain things and put further events in the proper context. BTW, even if you haven't read The Hobbit, I think you'll follow this book along just fine. Bilbo's account (There and Back Again) is told in summary in the prologue.After you read this book, I think you'll want to get one of those &quot;Not all who wander are lost&quot; bumper stickers for your car, too! ^_^"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the way The Lord of the Rings was meant to be experienced.

I should add that it stereotypes, but only because of the time in which it was written.)for all it is worth and publishing a dozen different editions. Everyone has seem to forgotten that Tolkien never wanted 'The Lord Of The Rings' separated, not even as three novels. Now, it is being sold as a box set! In separate books! I don't think he would be pleased.Tolkien is a genius. His imagination gave us a separate universe, but not one beyond belief. Read the book because it is worth your time. But don't expect everything to go as you expect. The language is not complicated, save the prose. There are certain glitches - sometimes the people act out of character. You'll LOVE them, though. You will criticize this book, because you should with every work you read. But trust the legions of fans out there, and experience it. Don't shun it when you haven't read it, and by reading it I mean to the end. It's insulting to everyone when you give a comment on something you don't fully understand because you don't have the patience to. That's bias.And I would just like to add that Alan Lee is a wonderful illustrator, and made Tolkien's works that much more entertaining. I own the hard cover edition binding 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' in its entirety. I really recommend that edition to add to your library.As for the movie, Jackson held true to the story, his movie is one of the best I've seen. Great cast as well.

Can't wait to start the next book!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an epic fantasy set in Middle Earth starring hobbits, dwarves, elves and even a few men.I love this story. I remember the first time I read it, at twelve. It took me three days to get through the Hobbit and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. All I did was eat, sleep, and read.I remember the chills that ran down my spine as Frodo and Sam first hid from the mysterious black riders (Ringwraiths) as they raced through the Shire and later on the road to Rivendell. The simple ring of invisibility (from The Hobbit) having taken on a dark purpose and the formation of the fellowship of the ring to take it into the very heart of Mordor captured my mind and drew me on.The characters, the places and the enemies are what make the story so memorable to me. So I wanted to list each below with a brief description (most are spoilers if you haven't read this before, but probably not that bad if you've seen the movie).The fellowship:-Gandalf the Grey, powerful wizard who still suffers the self-doubt and worry that plague all mankind.-Strider, mysterious ranger who both fears and desires to take on the responsiblities cast upon him by his sires.-Gimli, dwarf from the Lonely Mountain on a personal quest to discover the fate of Balin and his crew who disappeared into the Mines of Moria never to be seen again.-Legolas, the woodelf from Mirkwood, who comes to Rivendell to report the loss of the prisoner Gollum.-Boromir of Gondor, who sees in the ring a chance to turn the tides against the darkness in Mordor.-Merry and Pippin, Frodo's dear friends who conspire to join him in his quest before they know what it is, simply because he is their friend. They come as a pair until their paths diverge in the later books.-Sam Gamgee, Frodo's gardener and loyal companion who is determined to help his master succeed in his quest and make it back to the Shire alive.-And, of course, Frodo Baggins himself, Bilbo's heir, who volunteers to take the ring and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, \\"though he doesn't know the way,\\" although he does know there is every chance he will not survive the attempt.The places:-The Shire, the ideallic home of the hobbits, neverchanging, peaceful, and pure.-The Old Forest, borders The Shire and home of vindictive willow trees with mesmerizing voices, but also home of the jovial Tom Bombadil and his lovely Goldberry, the river daughter, who help the hobbits reach Bree in one piece.-Bree, an outpost community where hobbits and men live together in peace, where the Butterbur, the forgetful barman, redeams himself.-Rivendell, home of elves and the Lord Elrond, half-elven, and his daughter Arwen Evenstar (recently arrived from Lothlorien), the last homely home.-The Mines of Moria, deeply delved, filled with orcs and something much, much worse.-Lothlorien, the golden wood, home of the elves and the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. The Lady keeping secret one of the three elven rings of old.-The Great River, Anduin, the last road of the fellowship before it is sundered for good or ill.The enemies:-Ringwraiths, nine ancient kings of men who were seduced by the power of their rings under the One Ring. They are no more than shadows of their former selves, though the beasts they ride are real enough.-Sauron, the ancient enemy who gained power under the dark eaves of Mirkwood before being driven out and returning to Mordor to cast his shadow over the entire world.-Gollum, scrawny, pathetic former owner of the ring who desires and fears it more than anything else.-Saruman the White (Saruman of Many Colors), the leader of the white council who studied the darkness too closely, becoming it's servant.-Birds, ominous clouds of fowl who spy for the enemy. No place open to the sky is safe from their piercing eyes.-Wolves and Wargs, minions of Saruman who hunt the fellowship and drive them into the Mines.-Orcs and Trolls, dwellers in dark places and servants of the enemy, they are numerous and foul and always seem to turn up at the worst times.Besides the awesomeness, there are a few things to consider (though they don't change my rating):One, the songs are lengthy, numerous and everywhere. Not too bad in print because you have the option to skim past (though I think it worth it to read them all at least once), but I hear you have no choice but to listen to all of them in the audiobook. However, I do have a favorite among them: the longform version of Hey Diddle Diddle, which I believe comes along in the town of Bree.Two, this is a long book, purposely so according to the note from Tolkien in the frontmatter of the book. His goal was to write a long book, and he succeeded. But he did it well, so that doesn't bother me. Considering some of the epic fantasies written since whose individual books are longer than the entire combined Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I don't think they're too long.Three, there is no three. I like everything else.I recommend this to anyone, preferably in print. If you find you can't tackle the book, go see the movie. It's not an exact match, but it definitely channels the best of Tolkien in a format most can enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A new wave of readers have discovered \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the first volume in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. The next two areThe Two TowersandThe Return of the King.The Hobbitcontains an important backstory, but is not absolutely essential for enjoyment of this tale.Frodo Baggins discovers that the gold ring given to him by his uncle Bilbo is more than a trinket of minor magic. It is the physical embodiment of a great evil power. And its owner is looking for it. Frodo, along with three other hobbits from the Shire, travel to Rivendell to participate in the Council of Elrond. There it is decided to return the ring to be destroyed in the volcanic fires of Mordor, where it was originally forged. Frodo and eight companions set out to accomplish this task. The book follows the first part of their journey.This book was made into the movieThe Fellowship of the Ring, which is remarkably faithful to it. With one interesting exception. Between leaving the Shire and arriving at Rivendell, Frodo and his fellow hobbits spend an indeterminate period of time in the Old Forests as guests of Tom Bombadil. Tom was omitted from the film entirely. Both fans and critics have suggested he didn't belong in the book, either.Tom does not fit well into the taxonomy of good, evil, and unaligned creatures in the rest of the trilogy. He is clearly powerful, working magic in his forest by singing and persuading plants and animals to do this and that. And the ring has no power over him, not even making him invisible when he tries it on. When it is suggested in Elrond's Council that the ring be entrusted to Tom, this idea is rejected. Tom doesn't stay focused on any one thing very long and would make an inattentive guardian. The hobbits are refreshed by their stay with Tom, but he neither hinders nor helps them with their larger objective.Tolkien offered an incomplete explanation for Tom's presence in the story. In a world where everyone, good and evil, is struggling for power and control, Tom seems to have renounced this kind of power. There is an immediacy to the good he does for others, offering food or helping with a concrete problem. He doesn't sign on for a larger quest, and accepts no responsibility to lead. He exists in impenetrable serenity, while causing frustration in some of those around him.Tom is hard to understand and even harder to explain to an action-oriented audience. It is small wonder that the film omits him. But Tom Bombadil is worth understanding and is one reason you should read this book, even if you have seen the movie. Is there a place in the world for someone who seeks no power over others, even to do good?Think about your answer."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"...of a fantasy epic that is loved the world over.A little hobbit inherits a magic ring from his uncle--a ring that turns out to be something very much wanted by the greatest villain of his time...If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for, go ahead and do it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"We have two other editions of Tolkein's THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but this set illustrated by Alan Lee is extraordinary.

After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book.

Two are found in the first volume, two in the second, and two in the third. Apparently, Tolkien originally meant for the books to be divided into six volumes; not three, so I'm taking him at his word.The first \\"book\\" of the Fellowship of the Ring chronicles how Gandalf and Frodo discover the identity of an evil ring, and set out on a quest to get it out of Frodo's neighborhood (the Shire) before it can do any real harm. That is, Frodo and some of his friends set out on said quest, but they need to do it without Gandalf, who has some other things he wants to check up on. They expect Gandalf to reappear and accompany them, but he fails to do so, and in the end, they need to leave the Shire without him.During the first book, the hobbits leave the shire and have some adventures, encountering several strange things in the world outside. Elves, an evil willow tree, a very powerful singing man named Tom Bombadil, some undead called wights, a bartender named Butterbur, and a ranger named Aragorn. In the early parts of the book, not much happens to really excite or hold one in suspense. I got the impression that Tolkien was trying to ease readers into his adventure book. However, once the hobbits get to Bree and meet Aragorn, things start to pick up. They wander in the wilderness with him and quickly fall under attack by black riders. Luckily, they meet help shortly after that. Frodo then needs to ride quickly to the ford, in order to get away from the black riders.The scene at the end of this book, with Frodo in a sort of standoff against the black riders was really something; especially compared to the rest of the book, which was more whimsical and fun than suspenseful and exciting. If all you know is the Peter Jackson movies, you may be surprised by how far the action and suspense were amped up in the movies (though, in my opinion, to great effect.) Still, when I said that this book was whimsical and fun, that was exactly what I meant.Many points in this book are just plain fun to read. The adventure of the hobbits through the old forest, and their many songs and such while still in the shire were amusing and fun, and it was enjoyable to hear some of their stories about odd lands and strange people, as well as find out what happened to many of the characters from \\"The Hobbit.\\" If I had to pick just one character, however, who truly embodied the overall mood of whimsy in the first \\"book,\\" it would definitely be Tom Bombadil; perhaps one of Tolkien's most interesting and powerful characters. He's so powerful, in fact, that it's very hard to feel threatened with him around, and he dances in and out of scenes like a fairy in some children's tale.That having been said, I think that most children would have a hard time sitting still for the whole story. Some of Tolkien's descriptions get a bit lengthy, and children (unless they're very good and have been raised away from television,) would have a tough time with that, as much as they might like the subject matter.The second \\"book\\" of the Fellowship of the Ring chronicles how the ring arrives at Rivendell, a council is held to determine what to do with it, (and to provide some much-needed backstory,) and Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry set out again from Rivendell, alongside Aragorn the dunedain, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir the man and the wizard Gandalf. The party travels through the underground realm of Moria, the woods of Lothlorien, and down the river Anduin towards the fork in their path, where they must decide where to take the ring; to Gondor; city of men, or to Mordor, where it can finally be destroyed. As they move on, party members begin to fall away, until finally, the fellowship is splintered, with only Sam and Frodo left the guard the ring itself. Most of the fellowship members are either dead or in mortal danger by the time this book ends.The humor of the first half of the book is replaced here with high adventure, although some sections feel a bit tacked-on (such as the showboating of many of the characters during the attempt to cross Caradhras.) Additionally, the stay of the fellowship in Lothlorien feels neither humorous nor thrilling. I honestly found it more strange than anything else; strange in a good way, but not really all that engaging, compared to the passing through Moria.It's odd to say that the strangest place in the second half of the book was also the least intense, but that's how Lorien came across to me. I thought that the whole second half of the book was a great deal more interesting and exciting than the first half, if only because of the lethal enemies that get introduced right off the bat, but in terms of overall story quality, I'd rate them about the same. The point of the narrative is never really to set a mood or dwell on how the characters feel, which is probably for the best on some level. When there's evil to deal with, personal feelings really don't matter.We're still not into the \\"war\\" parts of the lord of the rings, exactly, and Tolkien seemed to have enjoyed skimming over smaller battles in his books. The more I read, the more I'm struck by just how much better the pacing was in the films. The books are just as good and entertaining, of course, but they're entertaining in a more high-fantasy, intellectual sense, rather than stressing mood, excitement or drama. Though the story is almost identical, the book and movie versions of the Lord of the Rings are really very different from one another in tone and pacing. Me, I like both, but not on the same day.Lastly, I should bring up my reason for reviewing these books in particular. Tolkien was Catholic, and his writings reflect a Catholic view of the world; where evil and good are both refreshingly-clear, and evil attacks from both inside and outside, hiding in the smallest and seemingly most innocent things. The ring itself seems both like a beautiful piece of jewelery and a fascinating source of magic power, but it's also small enough that people wouldn't normally think of it as being capable of so much harm. There could not be a more perfect allegory for sin, which toutes itself as satisfaction for vanity, greed, the craving for power, and yet, often seems like it's no big deal. Just one little sin. No one would ever know. Then suddenly, you're wounded to the heart by it, just like Frodo nearly was.However, although I view the ring as an allegory, it's important to note that the allegory is far, far subtler than the ones used by C. S. Lewis in the Chronicles of Narnia. In fact, I think that's the greatest strength of this series. Lewis' allegories didn't interfere with the storytelling much in later books, but in Tolkien's writings, they hardly even seem like allegories half the time. The real strength here is in the world view that his books have; the correct world view. That there is good, and evil, and all types of people are somewhere along one of those roads, no matter how normal or odd they may seem.Some might raise issue with the magic that gets thrown around in this story, and the other stories in this series, but it's important to remember that the \\"magic\\" in this tale is fantasy-magic. It bears no real similarities to the real thing. How can I tell? Because of the world view of those who use it. In this book, the heroes are, for the most part, outmatched and on the run from their enemies. Evildoers are very strong, and the good are very weak, but nonetheless, they go on a quest to triumph over their much stronger adversaries. The mentality of the weak prevailing over the strong runs directly contrary to the philosophy of the real occult; which always stresses the selfish pursuit of greater strength. So long as this mentality is present (victory in weakness,) any talk of \\"magic\\" in these books is not dangerous; just a harmless fantasy element. This is why I consider this book so good, overall.The minor imperfections that I spot early on are simply that the pace starts out a bit slow, and doesn't really pick up until over halfway through. Still, a patient reader shouldn't have any trouble getting through them, and even appreciating the sheer amount of detail that Tolkien put into this work."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It was only after playing Lord of the Rings Online that I felt the desire to read the books, & so I started with The Hobbit in January. When the day is done, I curl up with a book in bed & read until I pass out.So LotR was written 17 years after The Hobbit, but Tolkein's memories of his characters was as sharp & clear as if there hadn't been a pause (if only the same could be said for Anne Rice). LotR is more serious, which is a little disappointing since The Hobbit was more of a comedy. The IS comedy, but things get a lot more serious after they hook up with Aragorn.This is a nice fantasy story where a group of men ignore their racial differences & travel as friends to destroy the source of power of a common enemy. I like how the Elves have a realistic scene that even after the ring is destroyed, things will never be as they once were. The Elves are very interesting, being like tall glorious gods who watch the uneducated & unwashed mortals to pass the boredom of eternity.I like how even though these books were written in a time before Womens' Rights, the ladies are not housewives. Actually there are probably only three women in this entire book; Goldberry, Arwin (who in this book is a completely useless character who does nothing) & Galadriel (who is equally as important as Celeborn, yet seems more so because she is a ring bearer).One thing I'm particularly fond of is the lack of token romance that everyone seems to feel they need to throw into every book & movie. If you know of any other fantasy books that have no romance, please leave a title suggestion in a comment.After you read LoTR, it's not over yet; Tolkein's other book are related. You should also check out Lord of the Rings Online; most faithful adaption of the books ever made.Now I really enjoyed this book & the one before it, butt it genuinely has some things that bug me.*Galadriel is terribly annoying & she speaks in a way that no other Elf does & there's a chance that you're going to have trouble understanding what she's babbling about. It's like she's trying to force herself to sound poetic & seems to be repeating herself but changing the wording....& then the characters praise her for it!*Gimli should NOT find Galadriel attractive; Dwarf women are short & bearded so it would have made more sense for him to be attracted to a equating Gandalf than her.*Much like The Hobbit, there is a lot of singing. I'm suprised no one has made a musical out of his collective works yet.The flaw is the enemies. Yes, I can understand now why Dungeons & Dragons revamped Orcs, & even why Rowling's Dementors may be a little more badass than the Nazgul. When it comes to a small band of (mostly) mortal men being heavily outnumbered by the enemy or encountering a single powerful entity, the heroes win too easily & too quickly, all for convenience, making the battles rather boring. The enemies basically sissy-fight the heroes while the majority of them just stand in the sidelines & watch; when the ones actually doing the fighting are struck down, the others just give up instead of retaliate. & I can only describe the Nazguls attempts to get at Frodo as half-assed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Mr. Tolkien has created a truly fascinating world, of a variety of characters drawn from the well of time.

Even if you don't care about fantasy, like me (i'm more of the sci-fi type), read them anyway.The first book, the Fellowship of the Ring, was my favorite of the three. All the action is well timed, and the book provides plenty of cliff-hangers...not to mention the ones in-between the books! All the nine characters (after the fellowship is formed), are so very different and interesting, and I loved how they brought back one of the old dwarves.Basically the whole idea of the books is that Bilbo Baggins, a small kind of man called a hobbit, passes down Gollum's Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, in hopes that he might take it to be destroyed. Bilbo is 111 years old now, and doesn't feel he is up to the task. Gandalf and three other hobbits will accompany him- Merry, Samwise, and Pippin. Merry and Pippin provide comic relief for a while, until they meet Strider, and become pursued by the Ring Wraiths. They are now on a journey to meet the wise Elven King and Queen, who will brief them on their mission, as well as provide others to help them in their quest. The first book takes them through about half of their journey in the lands, while the second will be the other half.

Tolkien, is a fantasy focusing on a hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the favorite nephew of his Uncle Bilbo Baggins, the legendary hobbit who set foot upon the most storied journey of all hobbit folklore. Bilbo's story is told in The Hobbit, which is considered the prelude to this trilogy. Near the end of Bilbo's travels he came upon the most powerful ring in all of the land, known as the Ring of Power. Being Bilbo's favorite relative, Frodo inherited the Ring, among various other items, when Bilbo decided to \\"retire\\" and move to a different land after his 111th birthday. Frodo had known of the Ring through stories relayed by Bilbo, however he learned all that was to be known of the Ring from the mighty wizard, Gandalf the Grey. What Frodo discovered was that very little was known of the One and that its mystery was only exceeded by its power. Gandalf told of the very evil implications about the Ring and that the dark Sauron was in pursuit of the One. Frodo must set foot on a journey to dispose of the Ring in the only place which it can be destroyed at the very center of Sauron's evil kingdom in Mordor atop Mt. Doom. Frodo is joined initially by his faithful servant, Sam, along with Gandalf. Along the travels, the crew encounters several new characters and conquests, both advantageous and perilous and is continuously having new light shone on the mystery of the Ring and the true meanings of the journey. This book is the classic story of Good versus Evil. This book is a must-read to a fan of anything adventurous, classical, magical, mythological, or fantastical. The one aspect that really sets this book apart from the pack is Tolkien's excellent language and diction. His language is very descriptive, yet to-the-point. The reader can see what is happening without actually viewing the actions. Tolkien's language is very poetic and would be better served had the book been printed in calligraphy. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy will hit the big screen in successive Christmases starting in 2001 with The Fellowship of the Ring. However, this story is sure to be far better using one's own imagination rather than the impressions of someone else.

Tolkien sometimes skips around and you don't get to see everything that's happened. Instead you experience from outside view. But all this is as it's meant to be. Being with a single character every moment and knowing exactly what's happening at every instant would make for a boring read.

The novel is actually broken up into 3 parts, the first part is \`The Fellowship of the Rings', the 2nd is \`The Two Towers', and the 3rd is \`The Return of the King'. These books in that order are a follow up to the even more famous book by him \`The Hobbit'. The Lord of the Rings takes you on an adventure with four young hobbits and their companions to destroy the ring that was placed before them. Before I go on you need to know that a Hobbit is a small creature that is about to of our size and they are peaceful creatures that live in one place and enjoy staying were they are.The main character of the story is Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit that grew up safe until being adopted by his uncle, the famous Bilbo Baggins. If you have ever read \`The Hobbit' then you would know who he is, and if you haven't read \`The Hobbit' then I recommend that you do before reading \`The Lord of the Rings'. Anyways, after Frodo is adopted by Bilbo he lives with him for quite so time, but soon Bilbo leaves leaving young Frodo alone with the adventure in front of him. Once underway, Frodo is accompanied by 3 other hobbits, a dwarf, an elf, 2 men and the famous Gandalf the wizard. Their journey starts from the elf homeland with the new fellowship, although it is a journey just getting there as you will soon find out.This book was one of the best books that I have ever came across, since I have never really found it easy to sit down and read a book, when I do it must be a really good book. If I were you I would read this book and if you don't like reading I think this book will even be enjoyable for you. JRR Tolkien did a wonderful job writing this book and its worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Anyone who does not enjoy this book most likely does not understand the use of language. Anyone who says it does not have a begining, middle or an end and/or compares it to the hobbit obviously lacks the knowledge that The Fellowship of the Ring is the begining to the ongoing story that is The Lord of the Rings. As for The Hobbit, it is one story, one part, it is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings, which is one story, three parts. And all three parts are very good...very entertaining...very WONDERFUL. Generally speaking, The Lord of the Rings was intended for an intelligent audience. If you have a vocabulary of 350 words or more...CONGRATULATIONS...this book is for you.Some people may argue that Tolkien created hollow characters, that is a falsity. He, in fact, created complex characters. They each have very different personallities and internal torment (at times in the book). Gandalf is an exception to this because Tolkien does not want you to know more about him than the characters. His personallity is mysterious, it would take away from the suprises in the story if it were any other way.Tolkien's advid decription of the characters' surroundings gives reality to the story. Some may say it is excessive, however, without it the story would lack individuality (which is why it it so great in the first place). Most readers are used to seeing this: \\"The door knob was shiney.\\" Tolkien readers would see this: \\"The glistening morning sun reflected cheerily off the now luminous surface of the door knob.\\" (This line is not in anyway of/by or related to Tolkien and is only intended to give a vague idea of his writting style.)He uses literary devices to enrich his stories much like the ancient Greek poet Homer. (Do not let this referance of history discourage you from reading this book.) THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IS NOT BORING IN ANYWAY, SHAPE OR FORM!

Together with their companions Gandalf , Aragorn the mysterious ranger (and heir to the ancient Kingdom of Numenor ) , the young warrior from Gondor , Boramir , the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli we are introduced to the scope of Middle Earth from the beautiful to the diabolical , from the homely to the mysterious , from the noble to the villainous . We also see the brilliance of Tolkien as a poet as we are introduced to a variety of Poems and Songs recited by different characters.Tolkien stressed that LOTR was in no way meant to be an allegory and was not meant to parallel any events taking place during the time , in this case the Second World War.Instead he says he approves of applicability which he distinguished from allegory by writing that the one refers to the ' freedom of the reader and the other in the proposed domination of the author ' . Thus while we must always bear in mind that LOTR is in now way an allegory we are free to draw our own analogies and parallels with events in our world .The Lord Of the Rings was published in 1954/55 .At the time there where many similarities between our world and Middle Earth . The world was divided into the Free World (as was Middle Earth ) which was engaged in a titanic battle with the Communist World and its surrogate Revolutionary Movements which aimed to destroy the way of life of Middle America and Middle England (which was mirrored in The Shire of Middle Earth ) . It aimed to destroy our Judeo-Christian heritage and all that we knew as right and good (as Mordor aimed to destroy everything noble and beautiful on Middle Earth ) through the use of terror and their disdain for what they saw as 'bourgeois ' mirrors the scorn expressed by Saruman ( in his meeting at Isengard with Gandlaf described in Chapter 11: The Council of Elrond ) for the values of old , and replace it with a system of total power and enslavement . Therefore it is hardly difficult to draw a parallel between Mordor and the old Soviet Union ( or during World War II Hitler's Third Reich ) , between the Orcs , Trolls and even fouler things infesting Middle Earth during Frodo's journey and the Revolutionary regimes and movements around the world at the time of The Cold War held in thrall by Moscow or Peking such as Nasser's Egypt , Castro's Cuba , the Viet Cong and Gadaffi's Libya .As Robert Foster , who has made detailed studies of Tolkines works and written various volumes on the topic once said : ' I remember at a Tolkien conference watching a Polish woman reach out to shake [daughter] Priscilla Tolkien's hand , This was in the dark days before Communism fell, and she said, 'You have no idea what your father's books have meant to us. They kept us believing that the Orcs would not always win.'\\"The Lord of the Rings is the story of a long and difficult battle against great evil, taken on by the humblest,\\" he continued\\".Indeed LOTR encapsulates all that great values of Western Civilisation - Freedom ,faith , the importance of the individual and the heroism of the common man .We can take faith again from LOTR as in the words of writer JP Zmirak '' A SHADOWY, evil overlord hides himself amid an unmapped mountain range. There he wields absolute power over fanatics and slaves, scheming for domination over the free peoples of the world. He sends forth assassins into peaceful lands and cities, spreading terror among civilians\\" : which refers to the network of terror supported by Radical Islam and Revolutionary Movements today which once more aims to , through an evil theology , spread terror to the innocent (whether in New York , Antwerp , Geneva or Jerusalem ) in order to destroy Western Democracy and our Judeo-Christian civilisation . Once more we need the faith of Tolkiens World to know that the forces of evil , no matter what the odds , will not win."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Four words: I love this book. The way it is constructed and the way it is so in-depth and visual just blows my mind. This book should be required reading for high school. It is the epitome of great English literature.I read this book over the spring of 2001 in anticipation of the movie which was to come later that year. The movie stood true to the book, but I was dissapointed that they left key points out, especially out of the first half. I love Tom Bombadil.Tolkien created this world which reflected our own but was totally his. It took him years to make this book and the effort shows. You NEVER at any point in the book get bored of it. The people and cultures of Middle-Earth enthrall you.The story is about a ring. A ring that once belonged to an evil king. It gave him power beyond imagination, and he used it to rule Middle-Earth. The dark lord was defeated in a brutal war, but the ring wasn't and the spirit of him still lived on.The ring somehow finds it's way to a Hobbit named Frodo. Hobbits are halflings with hairy feet and habit of smoking tobacco. They are the most peaceful race of Middle-Earth. Once he finds out that this ring is evil, and that it is his job to destroy it, he flips out, but he does it anyway. He takes three of his hobbit friends along and have adventures and meet cool people.In the second half of the book, a fellowship is formed between the four main races of Middle-Earth. The Elves, the Dwarves, the Humans, and the Hobbits. The job of the fellowship is to destroy the ring by taking it and throwing it into the cracks of Mt. Doom where it was forged. Frodo is the Ring bearer of the fellowship, the one who carries the burden of the ring, which means that he is most vulnerable to it's wicked powers.Some people say it's a social commentary but I can't really tell besides the fact of the Elves and the Dwarves as peoples hating each other, and the fact that two members of the fellowship, Legolas and Gimli make a bond which comparable to brotherhood. The Fellowship in my opinion is everyone working together in peace despite our differences.This is one of the best books ever written and I give the biggest five stars it can possibly get."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book was a wonderful book!

In the book there is a suspenseful paragraph about the beginning of the story. \\"Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, one for the Dark Lord on his dark throne in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.

It was better than the movie because of its depth in everything. I saw the movie first and after seeing it I decided that I had to read the trilogy. The book went into greater detail with many of the events and it helped explain why some things were the way they were in the movie. There were a few flaws to the book however. First its length, the book is approximately 450 pages long and it can take a while to read. Second, it can become very hard to remember all the names and places which the book is heavy on. What I thought was weird when comparing the movie and the book was how a part of the book that would take 2-3 chapters, might have only taken 5-10 minutes in the movie. Where as with the action parts the movie might take 20 minutes whenever the book only covers it for a couple of pages. Overall the book is definitely worth reading even if you have seen the movie. My only suggestion would be that you go and read the \\"Hobbit\\" first, because it contains some background information that would help out quite a bit and also because it is a great book in its own right."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A while back I read the Hobbit, one of those stay-up-late books because you can't put it down. Well, of course, then I had to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I was rather disappointed at the time and never finished it. A month or two ago I decided to give it another try in anticipation of the movie. This time I did finish it, but I can understand why I never did the first time.First of all, Tolkien is a exceptional writer. He weaves a fantasy world of elves, demons, and magic full of color and life. His style, concepts, and general quest-type plot have become a much copied model for fantasy writing.However, his style is rather long winded. Although his writing is clear, sometimes I would get really tired of page after page of what the forest looked like. Sometimes I'd scan ahead and skip pages. Some of my friends, it turned out, admitted they did the same. Every once in a while it'd be problematic because I'd miss some detail and have to go back to pick up on it later. I can understand why I didn't have the patience at 12 years old to finish the book.Think of a bard, sitting by the fire with a circle of children around him. His story is good, but as he must last the entire night, he adds detailed descriptions of everything. Some of the kinderlings fall asleep. But everybody does come back for more tomorrow.

I put it off for a while, but a week ago I bit the bullet and started reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Am I glad I did!Many of you probably know the storyline, but for those of you whom don't, I will briefly put it out. Frodo Baggins lives in the secluded Shire, far away from the real world of elves, men, dwarves, and other creatures. As a hobbit, he lives without much interruption. One day, he discovers his uncle left him a ring with evil powers. His friend, Gandalf discovers this, and they decide they must get rid of it. So Frodo travels with his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin to Rivendale, to Elrond, a wise elf that will know what to do with it. Along the way, they have many adventures, and almost loose their lives several times. Once there, it is decided that there should be a group, or \\"fellowship\\", that will take the ring to Mount Doom, the only place it can be destroyed. The group is made up of nine: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Boromir the man, Aragorn the man and heir to Gondor, and Gandalf the wizard. They soon realize the quest shan't be as easy as they thought, and the fellowship threatens to break.Once again, I am glad I read this book! Although I knew most of it, it was fun reading it and finding out the history of everything and the new scenes and characters. The first thirty pages or so are hard to get through because it is basically a history of hobbits with a bunch of foreign names and places. Once you get through that, it becomes of wonderful read. Even though they say you should read the book before you watch the movie, I disagree. There was so much description and complicated plots that you should know the story first."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring, By J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantasy. It is about a hobbit, Frodo, who has been told by a wizard, Gandalf, to destroy an evil ring, the one ring of power before it falls in to the hands of Sauron who will use the ring to destroy middle-earth. But the only place to destroy the ring is in the fires of mount doom witch is in the middle of Sauron's kingdom.The only thing with this book is the Cliffhangers in this book are slightly annoying but it does keep you attached to the book.In my mind I think this book is very entertaining and interesting in the description the author use in the many situations Frodo gets into.This book had many good features about it and manly the plot makes you need to read the other books in the series The Two Towers, and The Retune of the King.I would recommend this book to first anyone who has seen the movie because the movie was great and the book is even better, anyone who likes fantasy, anyone who likes adventure, or just anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What is there left to say about The Lord of the Rings? I believe that, on this very website, the trilogy was named the best novel of the twentieth century. Now that the movies have come out, everyone is familiar with the story. It is unfair to come to the books for the first time now, with so many expectations built up. As good as the book is, it is still only a book. Frodo will not leap off the page, put his arm around you, and make you feel good about yourself. I fear people will be disappointed. Also, there is a very large contingent of people who HATE Tolkien.So where does that leave us?I have just finished reading The Fellowship of the Ring for the second time. For me, it was more enjoyable reading the book AFTER I'd seen the movie. Middle-earth is such a complex universe that it is easy to get lost. Do not read these novels if you are fixed on getting to the ending. Here especially, the journey is the thing. LOTR is about going places, meeting people, and having new adventures. The movies told this story from a modern vantage point - emphasizing action. In the book, the action is not as prevalent.I had the opportunity of traveling to Oxfordshire recently (Tolkien's old neighborhood) and I had the feeling that I was traveling to Middle-earth myself. That is the feeling Tolkien wishes to convey. He loved nature, loved traveling, and he wanted to write a book that expressed his love. I think the book succeeds admirably. To be sure, there is enough magic and monsters to hold your attention as well.Come to this book on its own terms. Get ready for a nice leisurely read. Don't expect a transcription of the movies and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book was amazing...one of those &quot;can't put it down&quot; kinda books.

Once again, the theory of &quot;the book is always better than the movie&quot; is proven true."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Those unfamiliar with J. R. R. Tolkien's book or have seen only Peter Jackson's splendid cinematic adaptation, may not realize that &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is part one of a nearly fifteen hundred page novel which was divided into three parts by Tolkien's English publisher, Allen and Unwin in the mid 1950's. The entire saga should be seen best as a very long novel, with each volume representing a third of the saga. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; we are introduced to Frodo Baggins, his servant Samwise Gamgee, and his friends and cousins Meriadoc &quot;Merry&quot; Brandybuck and Perigrin &quot;Pippin&quot; Took, hobbits of the Shire, an obscure corner of the land of Middle Earth, located in the former realm of Arnor. In stark contrast to Peter Jackson's film, Frodo Baggins is depicted as a mature scholar familiar with Elvish lore; a younger, more dynamic version of his uncle Bilbo Baggins, whose most important adventure was recounted in Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. His cousin Merry is also portrayed as a wiser, more thoughtful person than he is seen initially in Jackson's film. And Gandalf, their wizard friend, comes across as a bit more reckless than he is portrayed in the film by actor Ian McKellen.After celebrating his 111th birthday, Bilbo Baggins disappears in front of an astonished crowd of family, friends and neighbors in Hobbiton. His old friend Gandalf persuades Bilbo to give up the magic ring responsible for his disappearance, which he leaves to his nephew and heir Frodo. Years pass before Gandalf returns with some ill news regarding the ring. It is the One ring, the all powerful ring forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron; the ultimate weapon for seizing control of Middle Earth and plunging it into darkness. Over a thousand years before Frodo's time, at the end of the Second Age, a last alliance of men and elves fight Sauron in the land of Mordor; their victory is assured only when the ring is cut off from Sauron's hand. Isildur, son of the slain king Elendil, cuts the ring and takes it for his own, with dire consquences for him. The ring is lost, found hundreds of years later by the creature Gollum, and is lost again, found in Gollum's cave by Bilbo Baggins.Gandalf urges Frodo to flee to Bree, since Sauron's deadly servants, the nine Nazgul or ringwraiths, are in pursuit of the one who bears the One Ring. Sam, Merry and Pippin join Frodo in his quest. Before leaving the shire they meet the mysterious Tom Bombadill, who recommends to Frodo that they seek Gandalf in Bree at the Prancing Pony inn. At Bree they meet instead the ranger Strider aka Aragorn, the last of the Dunedain, the direct descendants of the kings of the lost realm of Arnor. He leads them eventually to Rivendell, after a perilous chase by the Nazgul, in which Frodo is stabbed in the shoulder by the Nazgul leader. Finally, in Rivendell, at the home of Elrond Halfelven, Frodo is reunited with Gandalf, who warns of his fellow wizard Saruman's treachery.Elrond assembles a council to determine the ring's fate. It is decided that the ring should be brought to Mordor, to be destroyed in the firy chasm of Mount Doom. Isildur's broken sword Narsil is reforged and presented to Aragorn as the sword that was broken and remade, Andruil. Frodo volunteers to serve as the Ring Bearer, with Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry and Pippin joining the Fellowship of the Ring. Boromir, son of Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, also joins the fellowship, along with the dwarf Gimli and the elf Legolas. The fellowship is ordered to accompany Frodo for as long as it is feasible, with some of the fellowship thinking of accompanying Boromir back to his home city and capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith.Gandalf, leading the Fellowship, tries to take them across the snowy pass of Caradhras. Defeated by extreme cold and a blinding snowstorm, and an attack by wargs (wolves), the Fellowship turns back and is taken through the Mines of Moria. Inside the darkened halls of the deserted dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf, the Fellowship is attacked by orcs and a demon from the First Age, a Balrog. Gandalf confronts the Balrog on the Bridge of K'hazakdum, and is swept by the Balrog into the abyss.In mourning, the Fellowship flees Moria and ventures out into the open, finding sanctuary in the enchanted forest of Lothlorien, home of the Elven king and queen Celeborn and Galadriel. After receiving parting gifts from Galadriel, the company journeys by boat towards the Falls of Rauros. Attacked once more by orcs near the falls, the company disperses, with Frodo and Sam making the perilous journey to Mordor on their own.I have provided the reader a brief sketch of the plot in the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, which does differ, in some substantial detail, from Peter Jackson's acclaimed film version. Yet I hope that those unfamiliar with the written text of Tolkien's words will be sufficiently intrigued to pick up this volume. Without a doubt, it is the great beginning of what many regard as the finest fantasy epic ever written."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I received J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for Christmas and had them sitting around on my shelf for a long time; I wanted to read \\"The Hobbit\\" first. But I had a burning desire to read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and so I set \\"The Hobbit\\" down and read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I obviously started with the first of the trilogy: \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" starts of in a small area of Middle-Earth called the Shire. We are introduced to our main character named Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins. During a visit to the Shire, Bilbo's longtime friend Gandalf the wizard discovers a mysterious ring in Bilbo's possession. So Gandalf leaves to do some research. He returns, after Bilbo has left the Shire, leaving the ring behind. Gandalf speaks to Frodo, telling him of the horrors that he discovered about the Ring. Many ages ago, one ring was forged in the fires of Mount Doom by the dark lord Sauron, and into the ring Sauron put all of his evil powers. The ring was made for only one purpose: to give the ring-bearer ultimate ruling power over all peoples of Middle-Earth.But in a battle at Sauron's fortress, Isildur, the son of the King of Middle-Earth, cut the ring from the hand of Sauron. So Sauron lost all of his power and vanished. But his spirit still existed, and it searched for the One Ring. The ring was lost but was found by Bilbo who brought it to the Shire. After telling the story, Gandalf tells Frodo to go south to the Elven village of Rivendell and seek the advice of Elrond, Rivendell's ruler, so Frodo journeys south with his friends Sam, Pippin and Merry.At Rivendell, they learn that the Ring cannot be destroyed in any way other than being thrown into the fires of Mount Doom where it was first forged. Only then will Sauron lose all of his power and diminish. Elrond advises everyone that the ring must go south to Mordor, the lands where Mount Doom and Sauron's fortress reside. Knowing what must be done, Frodo, having taken the task of ring-bearer, journeys south with a fellowship organized by Elrond. The fellowship includes: Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Elf.So that was the premise of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", set up in the first of the trilogy, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring. While reading the book, I could tell that the story was a great story and it is. What makes the story so great is that as the Fellowship gets nearer to Mordor, the harder their journey becomes, and no matter what they face, they have to get to Mordor and destroy the Ring. What also help the story are the places that we visit. Places like the Shire and Rivendell are described as beautiful places. It is through these descriptions that we can see a part of what is at stake here if the One Ring should return to Sauron, and Sauron claim ruler ship over Middle-Earth.What I really liked, apart from the story, was Tolkien's writing style. He would always describe everything in many details, making it easy for the reader to visualize what is going on, therefore enhancing the story. The descriptions really help not hinder the book.For this review, I decided that a description of the plot would be more important than talking about literary mechanics that made the book something enjoyable for me to read. I would recommend this book to everyone, but if you don't like the plot then don't read the book, because the plot is what \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" is all about. It is a masterpiece, and I am looking forward to reading \\"The Two Towers\\", the second book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is a great book. You'd be surprised to see how different the movie and the book are. And they are so different, that it would not be good to read the Two Towers after watching the Fellowship of the Ring movie. You would miss so much. And I would also recomend reading The Hobbit. But anyway, the story is about a Hobbit named Frodo. In the beginning Bilbo, Frodo's uncle (who you will find more about in The Hobbit), is visited by an old friend: Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo announces that \\"This is the end\\", and he slips on the ring, and leaves Hobbiton in the Shire. I do not think that it would be a good idea to tell you much more, so you'll just have to read it. But remember, it will not work seeing the Fellowship and then reading the Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"\\"One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\\"This proverb sums up the main theme of The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring in one carefully-worded phrase; indeed, this thematic saying is repeated several times throughout the novel. The legend-like story was written by J.R.R Tolkien to supplement the almost nonexistent native lore from his own country, England. This mythical style imparts a sense that the fantastic occurrences of the novel actually happened; while reading it, it seems as if you've simply stumbled upon a dusty scroll which matter-of-factly chronicles history.Like the unconcerned, humanoid Hobbits that the novel centers on, the story starts off very slowly, spending twenty pages detailing the history of Middle Earth and of the One Ring, which becomes tedious as the names of obscure places, people, and things quickly become muddled. Finally, the real story begins, only to stall a few dozen pages later when all the information scrupulously reported in the Prologue is then accounted again in another wearisomely long--though watered-down--history to Frodo Baggins, the Hobbit protagonist of the tale and the Ring-bearer. This lecture, given by Gandalf the Grey (another character crucial to the plot) becomes tedious after the first paragraph. The novel then continues with the action, and after another 100 pages, finally takes Frodo and his willing friends out of the agrarian Shire and into the real beginning of his dramatic and exciting quest. Frodo has been enjoined to take the evil Ring and destroy it in its birthplace, Mt. Doom, in the gloomy and disheartening land of Mordor, making Middle Earth safe from the dominion of the evil Sauron, whose gloved hand created the Ring long ago. At this point, the suspense level of the novel, which had previously been set at about two (Move Along, Please) skyrockets to twelve and a half out of ten (Under the Covers With a Flashlight).Though it starts off slow and plodding, The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring develops into an engrossing tale of incredible mythology. Since its first publishing in the 1950s, the novel has remained a bestseller- a fitting tribute to a genius such as Tolkien, who created the complex Middle Earth while holding down another job as an English professor. The history and legends extend far beyond the novels themselves, but unlike other less complicated fabrications, never double-crosses itself.This novel, an enduring classic, has been made into a multi-million dollar movie, filmed in the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. Surprisingly, most of the literally millions of viewers had never read Tolkien's works. In fact, the majority of people who have watched the popular movie have never read the novel, which remains the best introduction to Middle-Earth. This stands as another reason to begin the daunting, though highly satisfying, undertaking of reading the three volume, 1100 page epic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Don't miss the opportunity to partake in one of the most fascinating, enthralling, and indepth stories of all time!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I am a great fan of Peter Jackson's movie interpretation of the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" and it was the movie that inspired me to read the book. So, confession number one out of the way, I saw the movie before reading the book. Confession number two. I read \\"The Hobbit\\" by Tolkien earlier in the year, but I never finished it. Somehow, the book and writer failed to maintain my interest, but I am sure I will return shortly and complete that journey. There are so many different takes and perspectives on this book I thought it beneficial to this review to convey my background to reading this novel. Okay, onto the book itself. One of the traits of Tolkien I have had to battle with, is his flowery writing, in particular his tendency to burst into song (or at least his characters do) on a very regular basis. While obviously somewhat relevant to the development of the story and a key part of Hobbit culture, I found the plethora of poetic singing rather tedious at times. Nonetheless, I have read through most verse, except maybe the longest pieces at 2am in the morning. Certainly this style of writing will appeal to some and not others, but be forewarned. It is the mythical worlds that Tolkien has created that really elevate this book to lofty heights, and overshadows any (flowery) flaws the book MAY have in some reader's eyes. What Tolkien has brought to life is a sumptuous and complex mythical world that really has no comparison. The depth and detail to which he has gone into, begs the question, 'had Tolkien an all seeing private window into another dimension?' The many lands, races, languages and creatures are just glorious in all their pageantry and it is all laid out for us in a way which makes us feel that it was always so, and will always be. The unique storyline is complimented by Tolkien's ability to bring to life emotions such as fear, sadness, terror, and joy along with qualities such as loyalty, bravery, perseverance, doggedness and humility. The book is literally dripping with all these ingredients. I personally did not find this book an easy read, it demands attention and a degree of concentration, but the rewards are great. A masterpiece, truly deserving of classic status."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Many a time I have struggled with this book. Just way to boring for me. I wanted to read this book to see if it gets any better. And it has. It has grown to win a special place in my heart. Not as big as the Oz series but a small place. It's compeling sad light hearted moving and has many other traits. At the beginning it is hard to understand and boring trying to figure out but it slowly get's better and better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As I read through the incredible story of The Fellowship of The Ring I was amazed at what J.R.R. Tolkien was able to create. Through all the imagination of the story and wide variety of characters I was entranced from the minute I started reading. I felt like I was part of the story all the way through to the end.I very much enjoyed The Lord of The Rings and am quite excited to finally be moving on to the second book. Throughout the first book you really get the introduction of the story and all the characters. From poor old Bilbo to the young spirit filled Frodo the adventure begins.It really starts out in the quiet parts of the Shire where Bilbo and Frodo Baggins both live. On Bilbo's 111th birthday he leaves the Shire forever leaving Frodo his most prized possession. This most prized possession is the ring. To describe the ring I leave you this poem of description which can be found in the first page of the book. Three Rings for the elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their hall of stone, Nine for mortal men doomed to die, One for the dark lord on his dark thrown, In the land of mordor where the shadows lie. One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all together and in the darkness bind them, In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie. This one ring falls into the hands of our young boy Frodo and on his adventure to destroy the ring is where the real plot begins. My favorite part of The Lord of The Rings I must say is the part where the company is staying in Bree and come across there soon to be 5th companion named Strider. The descriptions of this great powerful man with rustic, broad features are amazing and very overtaking. He is by far my favorite character.Overall I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to everyone who can get through all the details and really enjoy the true nature of the book. J.R.R. Tolkien really takes you through his own world of imagination and I hope you enjoy the book like I did."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A Review by JordanA young hobbit embarks on a journey to destroy the ultimate ring that will release destruction upon Middle Earth if the true owner gets hold of it. The fellowship meets a raider name Strider and he save them from these dark riders who are after the ring.

It is a book of might and magic, also friendship and the battles against an evil warrior. I enjoyed this book but I didn&#65533;t like some of the parts where they got into a lot of detail and little actions.

Very good (I felt) on the nuances that readers notice in the book after first reading in (say) junior high and then re-reading it every five-to-ten years or so. Will especially appeal to the less fanatical Tolkien fan who deeply appreciates the book without getting into collecting the plastic figurines or going to the movie of it; the reader who because of the LOrd of the Rings went on to discover other, even greater stories like those of Shakespeare and Dante (for which I thank Tolkien whole-heartedly). Better than the (enjoyable, light) BBC version, and far superior to the American - accented production."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"In the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien uses many interesting literary devices to grab all kinds of different readers attention. Unlike some other authors, Tolkien creates a fantasy world for readers, to make the book more fun, and more exciting to read. This fantasy world is called middle-earth. Middle-earth is a place where Tolkien brings all sorts of creatures like elves, goblins, dwarves, orcs, and other creatures to life. Tolkien creates a plot that is more than good enough to make the fantasy world that he has created come alive. He does this by giving elements of nature more attributes, and making unreal creatures that people have only imagined. By reading this story the reader is able to relate him or herself to one or more of the many characters in the story that Tolkien brings to life. Another important thing that Tolkien was able to do in this story was make the adventure of the main character Frodo Baggins seem true to life. Tolkien makes Frodo and his friends be heroes to those people who thought that some things were impossible. In this story Frodo's friends are compared to companions that Tolkien feels are true friends of somebody. Tolkien uses a literary device that is similar to a gospel message. The message is that one this adventure the fellowship would not have been able to accomplish what they did, if they were not there for each other, and they did not work together.This was an excellent story because Tolkien did as much as he was able to make this story as great as it is. Tolkien shows the world in writing this story that people don't have to write like there is only one world. Tolkien's imagination has defied the ways that people think about what literature can be. Tolkien put his thoughts, his emotions, and what he believes in into this book. If you are a reader who is looking for a story with an unreal world, and unreal characters, and an adventure that is like no other, than this is the book for you. Even though this was just the first book of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Tolkien still leaves readers curious and interested how the entire story will actually end. In conclusion Tolkien's story The Lord of the Rings, can be an inspiration to anyone who needs any kind of uplifting, or anyone who wants to read about something that seems beyond belief compared to the world that they live in now.Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have just yesterday finished reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and &quot;the Hobbit&quot;. After being incredibly intrigued by&quot;the Hobbit&quot;, I can honestly say this book disappointed me. A precaution though: I loved &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot;, but &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the worst book in the series.To begin with, lots of stuff we learn in the beginning seems irrelevent. I confess, I eventually gave up on the seemingly inconsequential prologue and skipped right to chapter 1. While this problem doesn't taint the rest of the book too much, the prologue is just too long and showcases this flaw too much to just ignore.Even once the story begins, you still have to deal with the slow pace that I'm sure you've read about in the negative reviews. Tolkien just takes too much time describing things. Basically, the problem runs through almost the whole book, but especially in the early going. I realize some description is needed, but &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was just as descriptive, yet had far less space devoted to descriptions.But there's good stuff as well, Namely the charactor interactions. Scenes like Gandalf revealing the truth about the Ring to Frodo and Frodo's chat with Gimli's father Gloin really redeem this book.But that doesn't change the fact that this is the worst of the trilogy. I'd give it 31/2 stars, rounded down. It is true &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; will be remembered as the book that started the original fantasy series, but being there first only holds so much credibility. Thankfully though, &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot; were giant steps up from this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"(...)The first 200 pages or so are tough going--a leaf by leaf description of the landscape as Frodo and his pals walk and walk and walk (I think I got aerobic benefit just from reading!). It really helps to skip all of the awful songs and poetry (even Kahlil Gibrain seems inspired compared to Tolkien), which are totally superfluous. When the action gets going, it's good. The characters are a mixed bag (or baggins, I suppose). The hobbits are really engaging: lazy, overeating, territorial little critters who are very human and lots of fun. Gimli the dwarf is okay, too--he's got a huge grudge against almost everybody and thinks that subterranean cities are fun. The human warriors are fatuous and dull, though Aragorn (Strider) earns some sympathy because, despite his strength and lineage (he's the scion of kings), he manages to screw up constantly. The tendency of the warriors to recite 600 generations of their ancestry at the drop of a spear gets old quickly. The elves are the most insufferable creatures in fiction--impossibly beautiful, immortal, and do they ever know it! They also deal some drugs, but don't ever have any fun.The loopiest character by far is Tom Bombadil, an old geezer who can talk cranky elm trees out of devouring hobbits. This bizarre proto-hippie sings godawful songs and seems to have eaten too many forest mushrooms. He also appears to be shacked up with a teenage forest nymph. I think Tolkien means us to take him seriously, but it's just not possible.Gandalf is a hoot--a wizard with a sense of humor, the inspiration, I guess, for Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (which are much more fun to read than Tolkien). The best villain so far is not Sauron (who is just a yellow eye, anyway), but a character who appears for only three paragraphs or so--Bill Ferny, a stinky mortal who inspires more loathing than all the orcs and Gollums put together (I'd bet he was based on some Oxford colleague of Tolkien's)But with all the laborious description and with the tedious pastiche of mythology (some Celtic, some Germanic, a soupcon of Christian, etc.), the story is a good one, and you pull for the good guys. I had fun with it this time around.

There is really little else to say."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Over the years, I have joyfully delved again and again into Tolkien's fantastic world of Middle-earth. If you aren't careful, the lush descriptions and rich lore will enchant you into thinking this world is real. I sometimes have to pinch myself, remembering that Middle-earth is, after all, a world of imagination only. But what imagination! Still, I cannot recommend it unconditionally. The age-old criticism of this novel is that its conflict of good versus diabolical evil is too simplistic. Even if this is true, is this a flaw? Rather, it might be the most tragic aspect of Tolkien's tale - wouldn't we all rather live in an easy world of black and white distinctions, instead of our own unhappy, difficult and ambiguously gray world? That is why Middle-earth is so easy for people to love. Other notable criticisms are that Tolkien included no substantial female characters, and that dark-skinned characters are always on the side of evil. Truly, these are unfortunate anachronisms that mar an otherwise gorgeous story. Still, if you are able to willingly suspend your disbelief, you might find yourself enthralled by this epic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The book was a little beat up and had tons of writing in it.

I had the impression that he's a much-beloved character (at least in some circles)---but good grief, he makes even the elves seem hardly sappy at all by comparison! That whole section of the book was completely ridiculous---no wonder they left it out of the movie versions.One aspect of the book that the movie didn't fully capture, though, was Tolkein's portrayal of power-lust, especially through the characters of Saruman and Boromir. The ring represents a somewhat different temptation for the halflings (particularly Smeagol and Bilbo), a sort of unhealthy obsession with material objects, similar to that represented by Voldemort's horcruxes in Harry Potter (which also symbolize power-lust and a neurotic fear of death). The discussions between Gandalf and Saruman, and Frodo and Boromir, which were much better in the book and the movies should have used more of that dialogue or at least stayed truer to its spirit. They really helped bring out some of the basic themes of the novels more explicitly, but in the movie they were really watered down and generic by comparison, which really weakened the impact not only of those particular scenes, but of the movies overall.I've also heard it complained that the movies tried to force non-existent and vaguely hinted at romances to the fore, but I actually thought strengthening some of the romantic storylines was one of the better changes made by the adapters. It helped emphasize the values at stake, and in some cases actually tightened the plot and cut out unnecessary characters. For example, it was much better to have Arwen meet Aragorn and the hobbits on their way to Rivendell instead of some other random elf who played no further role in the story, rather than just having her be present at the feast given for Frodo after his recovery and then occasionally dropping subtle hints that Aragorn is in love with her. Tolkein basically just told us that there was a romance between them---the movie dramatizes it. Sam's interest in Rosie the barmaid also gives him a stronger reason to want to return to the Shire other than just that he longs for a peaceful, quiet life of gardening, and thereby raises the stakes for his character. I know the peaceful quiet life of gardening was really the whole point for Tolkein, but let's face it, he was a bit fruity on the subject (as witness the whole Tom Bombadil fiasco).As to this audio edition, Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I found the book to be rather tedious.

Since I read it long after seeing the movies I was not prepared for what I read, there are so many small parts that either were left out or changed slightly that its like reading a story you don't know entirely.

He has just the right type of British voice to bring the Tolkien books to life. I don't want to rehash the many other favourable reviews. This review is relevant for anyone who wants to make mp3's out of the CD's. Since the boxes are so large, and the cd's so numerous (I bought all three volumes) it is a logical step to rip the cd's and put them on your ipod or other mp3 player. This is where the glitches arise. Although the Ipod cd database found the tracks, the naming of the cd volumes and the individual tracks is inconsistent and confusing so you can't logically navigate through the discs. Each cd seems to have its own naming convention in some sort of secret geek code understood only by the inventor. I eventually solved the problem by making each disc into a playlist on its own so I could go back to the relevant disc and track number at will. This seems a very odd technical oversight in this day and age, unless it was done deliberately to prevent illegal file sharing on the internet. This fortunately does not detract from the otherwise excellent quality of the product."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Can you imagine being a bearer for a ring that is pure gold? It sounds easy but it is not because the ring has dark powers from an evil ruler. The ring can turn you invisible if you put it on but it is not good because it has a mind of its own. It can turn you evil. There is a hobbit named Frodo who has to be the ring bearer for that dark and evil ring Frodo also has to destroy this evil ring by taking it to a place of great danger called Mount Doom. Frodo's quest will be long and adventurous. But right now he does have some companions and they are Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf.The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring is a really great book. It is very suspenseful and as I was reading it I could hardly wait to find out what happened next. I really like the way that Tolkien describes the forest -- it made me feel like I was actually in that setting. The characters in the book are really cool like the Hobbits, Black Riders and the wizard. One thing I did not like was how long the book was but this particular long book made me use my imagination. Another scene I could really imagine in my head was when Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry were in a barrow and it was really dark, misty and cold. The reason that they were all in the barrow was because they were attacked by barrow-wights."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"When Bilbo Baggins of the shire has a birthday party Gandalf,the wizard,notices something different.

Simply summed up then Fellowship of the Ring is the continuation of THE HOBBIT OR THERE AND BACK AGAIN, which recounts the (mis)adventures of a hobbit, Mr. Bilbo Baggins and a ring. FELLOWSHIP, focuses on Bilbo's heir Frodo Baggins who when Bilbo in his aged state decides to leave his home in Middle-Earths shire, home to hobbits, leaves everything to Frodo. The mysterious yet kind wizard Gandolf drops hints to Frodo that the magic ring is not some parlour trinket, but of a dark design once owned by the evil Sauron, who seeks to claim &quot;the one true ring to rule them all again.&quot; Hence Frodo and his friends begin their journey to destroy the Ring before the forces of evil can destroy them.Might be hyperbole, but this is debatably the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The measuring stick against which all fantastic tales written since has been measured. Tolkien's gift of language and descriptive detail is second to none, possibly he was a magician in England conjuring stories in reaction to his keen distaste for what he saw the Industrial revolution doing. Read in that context adds an additional layer to a tale into which depths more than one hobbit, elf, dwarf and yes human has fallen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I realize that I will be ridiculed for giving this book such a low rating. However, it took me almost 2 years to finish it. Not having been a Tolkein aficionado, it was difficult at times to realize who was who in the narrative. After seeing the film by Peter Jackson, I was able to visualize, with greater ease, the cast of characters. Overall the book is very good, filled with everything you would expect from a fantasy novel, because in essence Tolkein created the Fantasy novel. You have plenty of running and fighting and philosophy. If you have only seen the film, and enjoyed it, you should read this book to fill in the cracks, it makes everything make more sense. Thanks for your time. T"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Alright, this book is the continuation of the journey of the One Ring forged by Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. It starts out in the possession of Bilbo Baggins of Bag End in the Shire. At his eleventy first birthday he leaves on journey, giving the ring to his nephew and heir, Frodo. Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, soon learns of the true identity of this ring and tells Frodo to hide it in Bag End. After learning that the ring is indeed the One Ring, Gandalf returns to the shire to warn Frodo. It is then decided that the ring must go to Rivendell and the last homely home in the west. With the help of Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took, Frodo manages to get Bree. It is here where the group meets Aragorn, one of the Rangers from the north, and one of the last of the race of Numenor.(sp?) Aragorn says he will guide them to rivendell. At camp at Weathertop, the Nazgul attack the party, and the Witch King of Angmar pierces Frodo with his blade. The group flees from the place and make haste towards rivendell where Elrond Halfelven might use his healing ablilities to cure Frodo's wound. After several days of travel, an elven rider comes to the aid of the party and takes Frodo with speed towards rivendell. At length, a host of all the peoples of middle earth is brought to rivendell to decide on the fate of the One Ring; it must not stay in rivendell. A fellowship of nine vows to take the ring to Mordor and the fires of Mount Doom, the place it was made and the only place where it can be unmade. The group sets out from rivendell and heads towards mordor. After being defeated at the pass of Cara...(i don't remember) the fellowship decides to brave the mines of moria. All turns ill when they discover the ancient dwarve city was over run by goblins and cave trolls. Escaping from the battle over the bridge of Khazad-dum, Gandalf is struck down by a Balrog; the rest of the fellowship continues on without him. in the forest of Lothlorien, Frodo sees a glimpse of his future shown to him by Lady Galadriel. After a stay in the forest, the Elves see the fellowship off with gifts such as cloaks, rope, food, hair(for gimli) and a vial containing the light of Galadriel(something to do with the silmarils, can't really remember) down the river, the group encounters a Nazgul on a flying creature that Legolas shoots down. At the very end of the book, Boromir is overcome with greed for the ring and chases Frodo off, when he decides to leave the fellowship for his own safety. Sam catches him and decides to go with him on his long trek into Mordor.

Make sure you have read the Hobbit before this book. This novel is the book that got me into reading again and I think about it frequently. At the start of it, there are some quite boring parts, including Tomm Bombadil and the Barrow Downs. There is too much description, but once the Hobbits arrive at the Prancing Pony, things start to heat up and the book becomes amazing. I cannot stress enough how amazing this nvel is."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I came to the start of this trilogy of books as a reader that had only ever seen them portrayed in movies. So to actually read them for the first time was absolutely amazing. For any fan of the movies I highly recommend it! The world is much richer and more vibrant, with greater nuance and detail, and just an all around more vivid and brighter world than the movies could ever hope to portray. They still did a great job though!The characters were richly displayed and wonderfully drawn. The scenery and descriptions were like paintings with words, and the world as a whole was just unique and layered and believable. I loved reading about the mythology and history behind the story, as well as the built up languages and the songs and poetry that helped make it all have such a rich tapestry. Some people complain that it reads like a historical text and that it is dry and heavy instead of entertaining. I didn't find that true at all for me, but then again I love to read history books so perhaps that's saying something when I say I really loved this book!Since this book was supposed to be just the first two parts of a very long book it didn't follow the standard story arc and that ended up bothering me a bit. I'm used to a certain level of excitement and lead up to some sort of a climax to finish off the first book, but that didn't end up happening. A lot of the deviations that the movie made makes sense in this light. They needed to make the movie have more of a traditional arc or risk not having people come back for the rest of the series. Tolkein never intended the books to be published separately and so his story reflected that. As a result, for me, the end of the book after the Fellowship left Moria really dragged out for me. I didn't end up enjoying it as much as I had the earlier parts.All in all though I really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring. I highly recommend it for fantasy fans and for anyone that is a big fan of the movies. Getting to read more about your favorite characters is just one small part of getting a peek at the mythology, poetry and language of Tolkein's richly imagined world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What can one say in a review of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" that has not been said before? I do find reading the trilogy through adult eyes to be a very different experience than that which I had as a child. One focuses more upon the historical detail of the epic, like a connoisseur savoring the undertones of a rare vintage, rather than letting the adventure of consumption dictate the pace of the novel. Minutia surrounding the days of Numenor is appreciated more, as are references to the events of earlier days, such as the fate of the kings of Arnor. Personages like Elrond and Galadriel loom more powerfully due to their connection to the Eldar Days.The experience is also changed now due to the ever-present figure of Peter Jackson lurking just behind the text. At first, I found myself confounded by images of Elijah Wood as Frodo (despite the obvious age mismatch), Ian McKellan as Gandalf, and other character associations from Jackson's epic. As the story unfolded, however, I found Tolkien's characters emerge from out of the shadow of their silver screen brethren. (Indeed, it was partly to emancipate my imagination from the tyranny of the screen that I chose to re-read FOTR at this time.)Ultimately, the story springs forth just as magically as it did when I first encountered it at the age of twelve, with important differences. Above all else, I feel the great sadness of characters like Galadriel, who realize that their time in Middle Earth is finally drawing to a close no matter what the outcome of the quest. An unfulfilled longing lies beneath the text which surprised me as something I had not felt so keenly before.The word reserved for such books is overused, but nonetheless appropos:Masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The fellowship of the ring is the first instalment in J.R.R.

On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere.

In fact had it not been for this very version of the story I might never have been able to read the trilogy in its unabridged form. The Library of Congress version, better known to some of you as the Talking Book version recorded mainly for blind would-be readers, just didn't capture the story at all. Because of the narrator's voice I just couldn't get into it.Then along came Recorded Books Incorporated with their unabridged recordings. In fact when I have a choice of audio book companies I generally go with them because of their excellent narrators. British stage actor Rob Inglis does a fine job of bringing these classic novels to life, and Fellowship of the Ring is no exception.The book comes in a very portable box and consists of about sixteen disks in four cardboard holders, although only the actual novel and the afterward that Tolkien wrote are featured here. The Concerning Hobbits material found at the beginning of the book is absent, but it can fortunately be found on one of the final two disks of Return of the King. It's actually quite a nice setup. In fact I've got the entire trilogy, now including the Hobbit, stacked on my dresser beside my bed, next to a small boom box for easy listening.As for the performance, as I said, Rob Inglis does a very admirable job. With his deep, calm English voice he's able to convey the narrative quite well, and while his voices aren't extremely varied it's still easy to tell who's speaking, whether it be Aragorn, Boromir or one of the hobbits. I particularly like the fawning yet sinister portrayal he gives to Gollum.All in all this is an excellent version, not the least because it includes the entire novel unlike other performances I've heard. An excellent narrator only makes things better. It's great for lying at home reading or taking a long trip in the car.

But when the hobbits reach Bree Tolkien's writing becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. And the plot darkens as well -- Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul and begins to slowly \\"fade\\" into one of them, as well as the increasingly harrowing journey through the Dwarf mines and into an orc-infested forest, where one of Frodo's friends turns against him.Tolkien wraps this seemingly simple plot in great swathes of atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the snuffling undead Black Riders, the shining beauty and immortal sadness of the Elves, the decay of the vast underground kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn and the elf queen Galadriel.

Tolkien. I enjoy these books for many reasons. First, he includes a lot of detail about scenery. An example of this is when Tolkien writes:\\" Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine.\\" Another example is this: \\"Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low.\\" Next, Tolkien also has a very interesting concept. The One Ring, a ring that, in the wrong hands could make all of Middle Earth slaves to the Dark Lord Sauron, has a mind of its own. It can abandon its bearer at will. Also, there are many obstacles besetting the characters. One is the Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who are determined to find the Ring. Another is the journey itself. The characters travel through many dangerous areas such as the Mines of Moria. There, the creatures living there attack them. Finally, I like the interesting songs and names. One example is the Elvish name Gilthoniel Elbereth. Another is the \\"Walking Song\\" which goes as follows:\\"The Road goes ever on and onDowd from the door where it began.Now far ahead the Road has gone,And I must follow if I can,Pursuing it with weary feet,Until it joins some larger way,Where many paths and errands meet.And whither then? I cannot say.\\"These are some of the many reasons I like J.RR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The first three times I tried to read the Fellowship of the Ring, I couldn't do it. It was too slow, and I hadn't really read too much of anything in the fantasy realm. However, now that my interest in fantasy stuff has gone up, I gave the book another try, which was a great thing to do.Ok, so the story is still slow at the beginning when Tolkien has the obligatory \\"Introduce the characters for 150 pages\\". Sure, that's boring after awhile, but it is needed. All the boring character development lets you read about the character...developing.After you get past all of that, the good stuff starts. The epic jounrey to destroy the One Ring begins as you read about the Company's travels to Bree and eventually to Mordor. The book does a great job with giving all sorts of in-depth detail about the setting where you can actually imagine what everything looks like. Truthfully, it helps if you've seen the movie just so you can get a really good visual picture of what everything looks like, which did actually help me when I was reading.There are also battles! Who doesn't like some mindless killing with orcs or Balrogs in the middle of a book? It's great. Plus, the end of the book leaves you at a sort of a climax for the second one to start. It makes you ask yourself, \\"What happens to Frodo and Sam?\\" and \\"They can't kill Gandalf...can they?!\\" Stuff like that.I recommend this book for any fledglings in the fantasy genre as it seems to be a must have. And for that matter, I suggest the other two books in the trilogy, The Two Towers and The Return of the King as well."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have heard many people critisize the works of J.R.R. Tolkien after reading only one if not even finishing one book. This particular book is more often than not the choice that most of these people choose to voice their uneducated opinions on. By uneducated, I do not intend it to mean stupid or flawed, only that they don't understand HOW to read a Tolkien book. It is important to know that to understand J.R.R. Tolkiens work, such as the Lord of the Rings series, you have to read ALL of them. In reality, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, are all one book, not three seperate books. One probably won't get the depth they expected from the Fellowship because it's only 1/3 of a book. This application for almost all of Tolkien's works. There will be a lot of things that you won't understand when you first read The Lord of the Rings, especially if it is your first time, but that is the true genius of Tolkien. All of his books tie in to become a realistic history, so to understand that history and what causes it, you have to read another one of his books. Just try it, if you aren't impressed by the Fellowship, go ahead and finish the series. Only then is it fair to make a judgement of Tolkien's literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, is certainly a work of art. In this novel, Tolkien creates a world where magic, adventure, and robust thrills are as common as a person who wants ice in his/her water. Describing the world in which Tolkien's story is set in is nearly unimaginable. Tolkien truly lets your imagination flow like a river right after a monsoon. By not defining every excruciating detail in his book, I was able to create a world in my mind that could never be described with words.The Lord of the Rings is set in almost a medieval period, with a magical twist to it, where everything is possible. It all begins with a jolly hobbit named Frodo Baggins. Shielded from anything outside the Shire (his home), everything he knew was beautiful. But a storm was brewing, and what was thought to have been the outside world caved into his backyard. Shadows of darkness marks the beginning of the most amazing journey anyone could imagine. Frodo Baggins has inherited the Ring, a very powerful ring that could be used to rule the world. The destiny of the world as we know it is put in the hands of a small, nearly insignificant hobbit.

TolkienReviewed by Enaud Ekralc9/20/02This summer I read the best book ever. It's called The Lord of the Rings, by Jr.r. Tolkien. The story begins in the shire, which is where Hobbits live. A Hobbit is a little creature that looks like us and has hairy feet. Frodo is very nice and worry free, until the ring falls into his hands. A Hobbit called Frodo receives a ring that has great power; the evil lord made it himself. Frodo must take a journey to destroy the ring. Only there is one problem, the only place the ring can be destroyed is Mt. Doom. Mt. Doom is Sauron's fortress. Frodo must go through a lot of frightful tasks.There are a lot of characters in the novel. Here are my favorites; first you have Strider who is a mysterious fighter who can beat any demon, then there is Gandolf, a wizard who is loved by everyone for his firework displays. I like Strider because he is really strong and he tricks the evil demons. Gandolf has great power that helps a lot of people. I like Gandolf because he makes people laugh and smile. Both Gandolf and Strider help Frodo through this task. They both play an important roll in The Lord of the Rings.I really enjoyed The Lord of the Rings. It has a lot of adventure that kept me reading. Anyone who likes adventure and fantasy books would love The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien made up a lot of characters that are mean, nice, ugly etc. I would recommend this book to all of my friends and my family. I think that everybody should read The Lord of the Rings.

Nothing changes in the book, at least hopefully. Most of the time artists try to make a living by remaking and selling the book. They change the cover of the book. I mean come on, the people at the copyright industries need to stop this, or else it will just keep on happening. WHATCH OUT J.K. Rowling, your Harry Potter series might be next. You should get a lot of your own books and keep them and sell them later. You need to do this because in years, artists will start taking advantage of this and give your prized books a new cover. One that you wern't there to see. If you hold on to some books they will be worth a great deal of money for the original book. The very first book with the same cover and same illistrater. You need to grasp what is yours and hold on to it.Well anyways, I need to tell you what this great novel is about.It startes off when a Hobbit ( almost like little migits ) find a ring. Acually it is one Hobbit. His name it Bilbo Baggins. He finds a ring of great power. When Bilbo puts on the ring it makes him invisible. But with great power comes great responsibility. Poor Bilbo i so cought up in the fun that he does not realize that a great evil is amoung this ring. See a great ruler of darkness and evil forged many great rings of great power. In these rings were the power to guide and rule each race. Three rings were given to Elves. Seven were given to the Dwarves. And nine rings were given to the race of men. All of the ring bearers were fooled by their greed and were blinded by the power of the great rings. For there was another ring made that they did not know of. In the land of The great ruler Sauron there was a mountain. It was Mount Doom and in the fires of Mount Doom he forged the 'one ring to rule them all'. It had the power to corrupt and decive all other great rings of power. One by one the rulers of Middle Earh ( where they live in ) fell to the power of The Ring. There was an alliance of men and elves and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought. They fought to distroy the One Ring. The alliance almost won when Sauron took matters into his own hands. He distroyed hundreds of Elves and Men. At that moment the king of Men stood up. He fought a use less battle and lost his life for it. His son Isiliadur, heir to the throne of men took his fathers sword. From the blow of Sauron the sword was broken. And with all his might he gave one last slash. Isiliadur had missed . . . wait he hit him. He had sliced of all four of Saurons fingers. Sauron was defeated. Isiliadur took the ring and stood at the heart of Mount Doom. He had but one chance to cast it from which it came from, but he refused. Insted he decided it to be a token to the heir of the ruler of men. On the trip home, Isiliadur was bumbarded by a band of orcs and killed him. They then tossed him in a great river, the Anduin. Although they threw him in the Anduin, they were not aware of his great burden. For over two thousand years is sat and waited at the bottem of the great river of Anduin. Until the Ring was found. It has been found by a Hobbit. No, not Bilbo Baggins but some one else. His name was Gollum. He Brought it in a great range of mountains east of were the Hobbits lived,the Misty Mountains. The Ring gave Gollum a very unusually long life. In the deep caves of the Misty Mountain he sat there ever thinking about it. Until Bilbo Baggins came and found the One Ring and kept it, not knowing what is did or does. He then passed it on to his nefew, Frodo Baggins. He then had to find a way to vancwish this evil that poisened Middle Earth.Will he suceed, or not?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I know people always hear how Tolkien is so great and it is a must read.

However, the fact is, if Tolkien were to publish his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series today, it would undoubtedly flop.His plot is cliche. Yes, I know that it is the protype for most fantasy books today, and in his day it may have been original-- but not now. His characters are flat. People rave about Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo and Strider, but can they compare to the type of characters we demand from modern authors who show us every characteristic quirk, gesture, opinion, thought and history of their personalities-- and at the same time not telling or showing us too much? Tolkien also packs his stories with details that modern authors could not get away with today. You think Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind could tell a story and describe every tree, fern, hill, rock, road and river and expect their books to still be popular? No. Not anymore.It took me forever to read this book. I found it slow and often boring, but I read it because this was Tolkien-- the master. I believe that many writers feel the way I do, but are afraid to express their feelings for fear of being shunned for blasphemy. I have respect for Tolkien's stories and it is true that he is the father of modern fantasy, but his style is now extinct."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Writing Quality: 6/10.Tolkien is a capable writer, but not a great one. He periodically injects humor into the tale, but it is sometimes inconsistent, and rarely truly witty, as opposed to what someone like T. H. White does in The Once and Future King. There is an intriguing, archaic storytelling quality to his stories, a product of his respected academic work with such early works as Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. It's consistent, and immersing. But the real draw of Tolkien's work, in my opinion, has less to do with his prose, and more to do with his storytelling, which is something more difficult to define, but has more to do with ideas and less with artistic craft. His descriptions sometimes feel like they bog the story down, and even his most-quoted and well-loved lines -- \\"Not all who wander are lost\\" and \\"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us\\" -- are not the creations of a wordsmith, but simple philosophical aphorisms that have been made memorable by a memorable story.Depth of Concept: 8/10.Tolkien himself chafed at the idea that his tales would be picked apart in classrooms, and he very much resisted the idea that they were allegorical. It's just a story, he would say, just enjoy it in whatever way works for you. But Tolkien, as an academic, was also steeped in allegory and myth creation, in studies of hero journeys and tragic flaws. What Tolkien really means is that The Lord of the Rings is not merely allegory, not merely something to dissect and explain. Instead, he also hopes for it to touch something more primitive and inexpressible in the psyche, something that can elicit visceral and emotional responses without having to be deconstructed. It certainly has proven to do that, but as such a rich work of mythopoeia, the multiple interpretive meanings available in the story are also very rich.Rounded Characters: 6/10.This is a tough one to score. On one hand, many of the characters are very flat, undergo very little change, or have very little ambiguity in their personalities. Aragorn, for example, is a pretty one-dimensional hero figure, albeit a cool one. But the depth of his character is perhaps a \\"3.\\" The development of loyalty and friendship in Sam is perhaps a little more rounded. But the reason I scored Tolkien as high as a 6 here, was because of Gollum's developmental process through the novels, which I think was highlighted well in the Peter Jackson movies. If there is an interesting story of redemption in all of Tolkien's work, Gollum is it. For him, I'd rate something around an 8 or 9, balancing out many of the other less-developed characters.Well-Developed World: 10/10.Of course, this is where Tolkien has to score the highest. His world-building isn't as existential or all-encompassing as what you can find in Moby Dick or Midnight's Children, but the great care and thoughtful planning of a whole, mostly original mythology is astonishing. It's too bad that so many fantasy writers connected so strongly with Tolkien's truly great accomplishment, and then tried to mimic him in inferior ways. The difference between what Tolkien did and what his imitators (Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, etc.) do is that he truly understood what makes a meaningful, ambiguous, expansive world, one that is more than the sum of its parts and that draws meaningful parallels with other mythologies from around the world. Reading Tolkien's works feels like the real deal, a real body of myth and legend handed down from generation to generation. Tolkien's imitators always seem to focus most on cool characters, exotic lands, and fun magic systems, and present a painfully muddled, and even careless understanding of what makes myth and legend stay pertinent over eons. Tolkien drew from his vast knowledge of Germanic mythology and philology in writing his novels; people like Brooks and Jordan appear to have used only Tolkien's novels as their foundation.Page Turner: 7/10.I debated how to score this category, because I've come to realize that as a kid I must have skimmed and skipped much of The Lord of the Rings in order to get to the \\"good stuff,\\" the battles and adventurous portions. When I go back and read now, it's not so much that the prose feels dense, as that much of it seems unnecessary. It's not hard reading . . . it's just that it often seems to take so long for a character to get from one place to another, without what appears to be sufficient justification. I wouldn't want to merely have the \\"good stuff\\" and none of the rest of Tolkien's rambling explorations, because then I might as well just be reading Brooks' The Sword of Shannara or something. But I wonder what a really aggressive but erudite editor might have done to streamline Tolkien's prose and tighten up his story. Ultimately, the book doesn't feel particularly well-paced, but Tolkien accomplishes such a rich and appealing atmosphere that it can be hard to put it down, even when you wish things would move a little quicker.Kept Me Thinking: 7/10.This wasn't like Moby Dick for me, where there were so many fantastic philosophical concepts running about in my head that I almost felt like I was achieving Burke's sublime. Rather, Tolkien created such a powerful other world that I can't help daydreaming about his world even after putting the book down. It's justifiable to question whether the thinking about Tolkien's Middle-earth is of as high quality as the thinking engendered in me after reading Moby Dick, but there is no doubt that The Fellowship of the Ring stayed in my head long after I turned the final page. And perhaps where that rumination can be particularly useful is asking why it stuck in my head, and dissecting the common human connection with myth. Enter Joseph Campbell and The Hero with a Thousand Faces.__________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 9/10.You could get by without reading The Lord of the Rings, although it seems silly to willfully ignore something that is so present in the modern psyche, and that is the best example of its kind by which you can judge the mediocrity all around us today, both in literature and in film. It is perhaps most interesting when paired with a thoughtful study of myths in general, but it's also important as one of the defining novels in modern British literature. You don't need to love it, but by understanding it you'll be enriched by a better understanding of culture, mythology, religion, and nationality.See my profile web site for an expanded review."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Book Review on Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the RingA Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins found a Ring with magical powers.

I can not deny that he writes intelligently. His world is undeniably well thought out. However, it seems to me that his style of writing is out of date and if he wrote the Lord of the Rings Trilogy today-- it would flop. His story is bogged down with detail (most of it unnessasary), the plot is typical (yes I know his story is the protoype for modern fantasy writers)and his characters seem very flat as compared to the demand we put on writers today for well rounded characters. I have great respect for Tolkien, but I think some readers love him only because of his reputation and not for his work. His style of writing is now extinct."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Has some engaging bits in it, but really only for real fantasy die-hards"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This Houghton-Mifflin hardcover edition has an inexcusable misprint--buyer beware.

I stopped on about page forty...which, in my version, was about page 10. Way too much detail. This book is lugubrious and boring. I can't stand it; I tried to enjoy it. I even started reading it again a few months ago. But it's just too damn detailed. I can't stand it.Remember: NOT ALL CLASSICS ARE GOOD. I can't believe this was rated with 4.5 stars.

The characters are fairly one-dimensional, the story is not all that interesting, and nothing happens as a result of the main characters. The fellowship moves along on their quest, but don't seem to do anything.The book's strength lies in the encompassing nature of the world that Tolkien has created. A long history of all the denziens of Middle Earth exists and you get the feeling that Tolkien may be more interested in the past of his world than the current story of Frodo and the Ring. The number of races (elves, hobbits, orcs), their interrelations, and their place is all of interest, but not enough to keep me interested in Frodo's dull quest in which he takes no action.Because the book ends without resolution, I will continue to read the trilogy and hope that Frodo becomes a more active character as he seems to try to become in the last chapter of the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As a self-professed nerd I wanted tot love this. I read The Hobbitt about 20 years ago and remember really rnjoying it. I expected more of the same here as I finally got around to Lord Of The Rings. What I got however was sadly a little boring, very tedious, and wordy to the point of confusion. Tolkien certainly has created one of the most amazingly thorough fantasy world. However, his writing style is so verbose that by the time he explains whose talking to whom you can't remeber what's being talked about. The actual novel could've been a quarter of the size and probably more enjoyable. I haven't given up on the entrire series but it'll be awhile before I feel the itch to read Two Towers. :("},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"this was a pretty good book, personally, i liked the movie better, but it did have a pretty interesting plot when you get passed the details, which are really boring in the way that it spent 2 pages explaining everywhere they went. It is an amazing journey that gets some hobbits and men and some mythical creatures in mortal trouble, and JRR tolkein did do a good job writing out the fight scenes so you could tell what was happening, it actually was exiting to read.Im not going to try to explain the whole plot, because there are so many parts to it that I would be typing all day, but I will say that a bunch of different creatures are on a quest to destroy the ultimate evil.

As far as I can tell because I've just read the first book which is called \\"The Ring Hikes\\" or something like that. But I must also give a little word of advice, if you really want to read it then you should first read \\"The Hobbit\\" because there the story is told how Bilbo Beutlin, one of a big hobbit family, gets the ring in the first place. So the whole story is about wizards, hobbits, who are like humans only a little smaller and fatter. Then there are elves and black knights. And naturally the ring plays an important role, because there are also other rings around but only one is able to rule them all and he was created by the dark ruler of the land of Mordor, which tries to conquer the world. So if you're interested in an interesting and magical fairytale which you can only hardly put aside you should really read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Please don't get mad at me people, because yes I am only fifteen. I attempted to read this book because last year we had read the Hobbit in 8th grade, and I was one of the few who actually liked the book. I have loved the movies for years, but for the first time i found myself holding the Fellowship of the Ring, ready to dive into it. Right off the bat, I was a little taken aback by the long prologue, which wasn't really a prologue at all but more like a history of Middle Earth. I don't see why this was really needed when they tell you about it later in the book..OK moving on. Once the story started moving i was good and enjoyed it then...ughhh we got to the four chapters of them in the forest, and Tolkien describes the trees, the sun, the moon, the stars, basically everything, and then Tom Bombadil comes in and his part in the story is in one word, boring. I couldn't wait to be done with his chapter. I mean how much can someone possibly want to know about mushrooms. After that part, it was very enjoyable..all the way up to the Council of Elrond. I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I HATE THIS PART! This part is so amazingly boring, that it is because of this that I have put the book down, and am not ready to pick it up again soon. Now if someone will tell me one good reason why I should continue on reading, I will take their reason into consideration.

The rest of this series is absolutely superb (especially The Two Towers). Though I must admit that this is J.R.R. Tolkien's worst book about Middle Earth, it's still pretty good and is well written. The only thing that I really dislike about Tolkien's world is the elves. They strike me as silly and unmotivated, and even though they have infinite wisdom and strength they send in a bunch of untrained hobbits to do the dirty work of getting rid of the ring. Luckily there are some brave and honorable characters like Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam, who are willing to save Middle Earth, no matter what might happen to themselves.

I do not get why this trilogy, even back when it was made, was so revered. Tolkien is the reason I'm not such a fan of fantasy (the other reasons being Squaresoft and other Video game companies, and a few bad authors). Tolkien was basically the inventor of all of today's popular cliches. A nobody who by chance gets a powerful object that must be delt with, an old pointy-hatted wizard, that dark force that wants to rule the world... despite all this, there really is almost no plot to speak of. Basically Frodo and company go from here to there and everywhere in between, with the events having almost no connection. Alot of characters were pointless too. What exactly was the purpose of Tom Bombadil, Rivendell, or Boromir? Ok, Boromir had SOME importance, but Rivendell ended up summing up what we all knew all along: that Frodo had to go to Mordor and destroy the ring (Which he does almost withut incident). I guess this trilogy is good if you crave adventure and exploration, because its certainly nothing if you want complex plots.On a side note, I rather liked the Silmarillion..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Let me see the flaws in this so-called &quot;masterpiece&quot;, that I should call THE LORD OF BOREDOM:1) WHy the hell all the characters must have at least two different names (in different languages)?2) The &quot;songs&quot; are a joke, boring, it only serves to destroy the narrative;3) endless repetitive descriptions of characters and environment, such as sunset, sunrise, &quot;the air was heavy and hot&quot;, &quot;the hobbits were tired and hungry&quot;, &quot;the fields were green&quot;, &quot;the sky was foggy&quot;, ...

Tolkien is about three hobbits: Frodo, Pippin, and Sam, who take an adventure. Frodo has a ring that can turn him invisible, and the enemy wants that ring. The conflict in the book is good versus evil, where the good guys are hobbits, elves, and a wizard named Gandalf, and the bad guys are Black Riders. There are other bad guys in this series like goblins, Gollum, and trolls, but we do not encounter them in this book. The most interesting parts are when Black Riders find Frodo and want the ring, which happens several times in the book.You should not read this book unless you like explanations all the time and extremely slow pace. The best thing about the book is also the worst thing; Tolkien makes you think something will happen when Black Riders come into the picture, but most of the time nothing happens. This could be considered suspense, but it is also boring. Too often all that happens is the three hobbits travel, eat, and sleep. There was singing in this book, and the songs do not belong. The people who would enjoy this book are adults, not kids or teens. This book is similar to The Hobbit, another J.R.R. Tolkien book. The Hobbit was better than The Fellowship of the Ring: Book One because there was more action and less description."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The plot is some sort of Reluctant Everyman Hero Vs.

Leave it aside, go for the movie. Otherwise you will end up writing a review for the first time here. If you are one of these people and reading this but yet ignoring all the 1 star reviews given to this book, you will soon learn that no matter how hard you try loving the book due the hype of the movie, you cannot finish the book because you will soon fall asleep. Really.They are right when they say the journey was too detail and a tiring read. I would just want to add my point, this book sounds more like a history book of sorts (oh I heard from somewhere its suppose to be literature but I was too late) when the Council of Elrond take place. Generally the book has TOO MANY names of beings and places thrown to you very quickly without you ever recalling where they came about. Maybe I read it too fast to avoid the walking excercise in the book. Maybe I was not paying attention, ironically, its was supposed to be a book so great that I couldn't stop reading but then again I was too tired forcing myself. I am getting nowhere after 3/4 of the book. Henced I decide to drop it at page 330 and turn on pc to tell you this.I am not writing to criticise Tolkien.

After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed \\"Not another (...) elf!!??\\". Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is mindless, poorly written, and an utter bore."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I think this book is one of the most boring loads of... I have ever read. I am someone who tends to suffer a lot from insomnia, but all I have to do to beat it is just read ten pages from this book, and I am asleep like a baby. Although my opinion is definitely in the minority, I am far from alone either. I have read the ten most recent 1-star comments on The Fellowship of the Ring... The consensus is that the book is boring! J.R.R. Tolkein, like many other conservative academics, had a creative mind, but was much more of an analytical author than he was a storyteller. After seeing and loving the movie before reading the book, the book was a real disappointment. Most of the parts of the movie that I enjoyed were not even in the book to begin with! The scene where Merry and Pippin accidentally set off the dragon firework is not there. The scene where Bilbo and Gandalf are outdoing each other with smoke sculptures is not there. The gripping battle between Gandalf and Sauron was not there either! These were all things that would have picked up the pace of the novel tremendously if they had been there. They would have indicated real CHARACTERISATION as opposed to dry description and journalistic chronicle. The Harry Potter series may be bubblegum in comparison, but my God, at least it is readable! J. K. Rowling is ten times the storyteller that Tolkein is. If only you could combine Tolkein's creative ideas with Rowling's narrative flair, you would have one hell of a fantasy author."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I'm not one who's much for fantasy, or I should say thought I wasn't.

This seemed to drag on until at least the middle of the book with moments of excitement in between. I almost tossed it a few times at this point. Luckily when I did arrive to the later half and the begining half of the second book, it made it all worth while.

As well as the important intiations of life that we as humans, need to feel more alive and to gauge where we are in our development.

But I had always found it to be a tough read. The language is old, the locations are confusing, the implied histories of the civilizations... it all got to me. In fact, I don't believe I had ever progressed as far as completing The Return of the King. However, the ideas behind the story have always appealed to me and never stopped me from coming back to the books time and again. I recently sat down and read \\"The Hobbit\\" to my seven-year old son, and that really whetted my appetite for more. This is the first opportunity that I've taken to read The Fellowship of the Ring after the Peter Jackson movies.I've watched the Peter Jackson films repeatedly. I estimate close to a dozen times on The Fellowship, so I'd like to think I'm well versed in the movie adaptations. So with this in mind, I began my own personal quest to read The Fellowship. I realize that I don't think \\"big\\" enough when reading epic novels. I can't picture so grand a scale for something so foreign to me. But with visuals from Jackson's movies in my head, I could better envision the story as it unfolded in the pages in front of me. The books and the movies are not the same, and I appreciate that. The film adaptations move parts around to make the flow more natural, and omit areas that would drag in a movie, but it gave me the basis for the proper mental visual.Reading it on a Kindle adds a new dynamic to clear another of my hurdles - the language. Not so much the created language of the elves and dwarves etc, but the use of old English verbage that is not in common use. I had come across many words I do not understand and with the press of a key I could get the translation and move on, not bewildered.And so with the issues of verbage set aside, and the trick to getting past my own mental block of not thinking \\"big\\" enough with the imagery now taken care of, I was able to sit down and ENJOY the book as it was meant to be enjoyed. I didn't find myself skipping passages, I found myself compelled to read more, I didn't feel like I was forcing myself into a chore, and thankfully, did not find myself comparing the novel to the film adaptations. For the first time, I felt like I appreciated Frodo (all previous reads, I thought to myself he was a second-rate Bilbo). The characters really are compelling if not somewhat mysterious. The pacing is questionable at times but the scope of the story is absolutely stunning."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"My opinion: Brilliant. Simply brilliant. This is the best book I've read in a long time. The characters are realistic, the action is-edge-of-your-seat, and the setting is incredibly believable. This is good stuff. Most people have told me that The Fellowship of the Ring is a boring book, but I completly disagree. Reccomended to anybody."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has never appealed to the literati. Your English professor would hate it. It is wordy, conventional, direct, stereotypical, repetitive, bombastic and overly descriptive. But with so many faults, why is it still so good? Because ultimately, these are faults only of style, not of substance. Judged by its substance, this book has few peers.You must not approach this book lightly. Those who take up this work expecting the easy rewards of \\"Harry Potter\\" will quickly bog down in its philology, its faux history, its detours into song and verse, its cast of thousands, its sheer quantity of verbiage. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not a book that is read; one must be prepared to soak in it and absorb it through one's pores. Tolkien has painstakingly created a world so vivid that it exists in a parallel universe of heightened reality. It is more vibrant and more vital than our own world, but this sense unfolds slowly through a meandering plot filled with flashbacks and disjointed narrative. The opening chapters that introduce us to Hobbits, to the Shire and to the back-story consume over seventy pages and constitute a small novella of content. Yet nothing much happens in this time: it is all about history and premonitions and plans. If this sort of sustained and protracted build-up bores you, then frankly, you should save yourself the bother of starting.But if you have the determination to stick with it, the rewards are without equal. No other book in the past century so effectively addresses questions like \\"For what do I struggle\\", \\"For what do I live\\", \\"Why go on\\", and \\"Who am I\\"? Most writing struggles with simply asking such questions; \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" gifts us with the most inspiring of answers.By now, the plot is so well known that it is unnecessary to describe it. However, it would be a mistake to think that the book is just an adventure story about hobbits who save Middle Earth, or just an epic saga about courage and sacrifice. It is essentially a spiritual quest in which heroes--especially little ones--affirm what we struggle for, what we live for, why we go on, and ultimately, who we are.This work is so strongly identified with its genre that we tend to overlook its genius as pure literature. The themes that Tolkien evokes are the kind typical to the great books: life and death, good and evil, preservation and corruption, redemption and sacrifice. Not least we deal with pity and grace. We could be speaking of \\"Les Miserables\\". But in setting his creation to fantasy, Tolkien imbues it with a mythic aura that allows \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" to share in the conventions of fantasy while going beyond the genre's limitations. Few other works manage to surpass their genres, and none do so more skilfully.I used to think that to read this book is to love it. Time and age have taught me that this is not so. This book requires a determination and a forbearance that does not come easily to the modern mind. We are now so addicted to instant gratification that we no longer savour expectation--nor are we prepared to toil for our rewards. But if you are one who can still appreciate the art of waiting and can see beyond the book's stylistic faults, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will inspire you with a transcendent experience unique in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I generally don't reread books. I have so many waiting in the queue (two years backlog at last count, when friends recommend a book to me I ask them to check back in 2007 to see what I thought of it) that I don't really have time to go back and read stuff that I finished years ago, no matter how much I enjoyed it. And yet here I am, going through the famed trilogy again. I first read LOTR when I was about ten years old and while many of the finer details were absent from my memory, I managed enough of a general gist of the books to avoid going back to them, even resisting the urge when the movies came out to dive into a reread frenzy, even as the rest of my friends were tearing through them (plus I had a certain satisfaction, having gotten to them years before, first on the block syndrome and all that). And I did successfully resist through the three years of movie releases. But when I saw the extended version of the final movie, I was struck by a few scenes that I didn't remember that clearly, as well as reading some articles on the differences between the books and the movies, what was left in, left out, changed, etc. With all that in mind, I figured it was worth a shot to go through the books again, with an adult mind (in theory), since I don't know if I appreciated them enough as a kid. Of course, there was also a risk I would find them tedious and dull and just ruin all the magic but it was one I was willing to take. And it turned out to be a good idea. I firmly believe the reason Middle-Earth has remained stuck in everyone's consciousness over the years was because Tolkien treated it like a real place, made it a living, breathing world, down to the nuts and bolts of its history and as such it almost became a place you wanted to live. I've never encountered a made up place that feels as solid as Tolkien's creation does. That said, Fellowship of the Ring is interesting but also acts as setup, putting everything in place for the events that would happen in later volumes. The pace is far slower than I remembered, when I reached page two hundred and they hadn't left the Shire I knew I was in for a long haul. But you know what? I barely noticed. All the templates of modern epic fantasy are here and done right, by contrasting the average lives of the \\"little people\\" with the actions of the big important immortal people and mixing them all together, he really creates a world shaking feel, that big events are just around the corner and going to change everything. His writing has a casual ease to it, sure everyone speaks in stilted fantasy dialogue but it reads easy and the going went much faster than I would have thought. His gift for description is amazing, he relates enough to develop a sense of wonder but doesn't bog down the proceedings by describing every leaf and blade of grass. Those looking for action will probably be sorely disappointed, as will those looking for women characters (saving the world was man's work apparently, but it was a different time, kids) and yes, if you boil it down to the basics, you can summarize it, in the words of my brother so many years ago, as \\"all they do is walk around!\\" True, in a sense, but it's how they do it that matters and if you let yourself be immersed in the epic sweep of affairs, you'll be walking right along with them. The movie is what it is, and was a great experience, but they had to cut corners, literally transferring this novel to screen, as much as it alarmed purists would have made a dull movie. So think of the movie as the Cliffs Notes version of the book, I heartily recommend both, but if you want the full effect, the text is the way to go. This will be one reread I won't regret."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"No words can due justice to this audio book. It is incredible. The reading by Rob Inglis is beyond belief. He is so consistent with the character's voices throughout the reading, I wondered how he kept all of the characters straight in his mind while maintaining the dramatic content. There are over 20(+/-) major characters along with many characters involved in sub-plots, WOW!I listened to the entire Trilogy and to The Hobbit as well. I have thought about listening to the entire series again (I am in the car a lot). It is a performance worth taking the time to listen to and the financial investment to purchase.

I took me about six weeks to get through it.I enjoyed every minute."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is J.R.R Tolkein's magnificent start of an epic fantasy trilogy that continues in The Two Towers and climaxes in book three, Return of the King. In my opinion, it is the greatest fantasy epic of our time. The Fellowship of the Ring is the story of Frodo Baggins, who becomes the unwilling heir to the One Ring forged by Sauron the Dark Lord in the dark and foreboding land of Mordor. The Ring had come to be in the possession of his uncle, Bilbo Baggins, who kept the Ring hidden in the Shire for sixty years, ever since discovering it while lost deep under the Misty Mountains. The book goes into much more in-depth detail than the movie does. In the book, when Gandalf the wizard discovers the nature and origin of the Ring, he speaks to Frodo things concerning the shadow of the past, tracing the history of the Ring from its making to the present, unlike the film, due to time constraints. Frodo then realizes that he must flee his homeland the Shire, and journey to Rivendell, home of the Elves, as Gandalf suggested. After narrowly surviving perils of his journey, Frodo arrives in Rivendell, where the Council of Elrond is held. There it is decided that since the Ring is the work of Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor, it must be destroyed in order to save Middle-earth from total annihilation, for annihilation is what would occur if Sauron ever reclaimed this One Ring of Power. Frodo embarks on a perlious Quest, his destination being the Cracks of Doom in the very center of the Sauron's dark realm. He is accompanied by Gandalf, and an Elf, a Dwarf, two Humans, and three of his Hobbit companions.Brilliantly written, The Fellowship of the Ring is a work of art with a broad scope. It is filled with adventure, drama, and magnificence. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the best book i've ever read. tolkien is a brilliant author with a very vivid imagination.

Listening to this unabridged rendition of the story added yet more insight into an amazing epic tale. Robert Inglis reads so very well, characterizing the voices enough to tell the difference between characters, but not overdoing. I also love that he actually sings the many songs in the book. He sings unaccompanied by music, just as the character in the story would, and the melodies fit the setting very well. When reading, I tended to skip the songs - especially the long ones. Hearing them as they would have been done by the characters added depth to the story that is missed in just reading.

Suddenly, he gets the urge to go traveling again. He disappears in the middle of his 111th birthday party, leaving the ring to Frodo, a young hobbit he adopted. Gandalf the wizard comes and tells Frodo that the ring is evil, and he has to take it to Mount Doom to destroy it. Otherwise, the evil Sauron will take over the world. Frodo and his hobbit friends journey to a few places, then they go to the Council of Elrond, a meeting about the ring. It is decided that a few others will accompany Frodo to Mount Doom. There are nine of them in all, and they form the fellowship of the ring (hence the title). They have to encounter many hardships, and the end of the book isn't even the end. It leaves you hanging until you read the Two Towers.This was a very complex book. It started out really slow and boring. It took about ten minutes per page, and I had to re-read some of the pages to understand. But after Bilbo leaves, things start to get darker and scarier, and the plot moves faster. I felt so bad for Frodo because so many bad things happen to him, and he didn't even want the ring. It was a little slow, but very well written. If you don't like descriptions, then you may not like this. The page are filled with descriptions, but they don't bog the story down, they add to it.

In Fellowship, Tolkien begins to weave an intricate story, laying the foundation for a bold adventure. A seemingly ordinary member of an unnoticed race of hobbits is thrust into a quest that will determine the fate of everyone.For anyone who has read The Hobbit, Fellowship is much more sinister, complicated, and grand in scope. Over 400 pages, Fellowship contains a rich treasury of details of characters, thoughts, and conflicts that The Hobbit does not contain.For anyone who has seen the movie and is curious about reading Fellowship, do it! From the book one gets a much greater feel for the degree to which the Hobbits struggle just to make it to Rivendell. The movie leaves out fantastic characters like Tom Bombadil, a jolly, mysterious care-taker of the Old Forest who is the oldest known creature of Middle Earth.Also, if you're interested in history, you will love Fellowship of the Rings. Inspired by old European history, Tolkien creates his tales out of the myths and legends of what happened before mankind existed.I must, however, give one caveat: if you read Fellowship, you won't stop there.

Be warned, however, that it is one continuous story, published for practical reasons in three volumes. The Fellowship of the Ring is not complete in itself, and indeed, ends on an excruciating cliff-hanger. I guarantee, you will need to know what happens next. Once you know, this is no problem, as the other two volumes are very easily obtainable. This is one fantasy work that is never going to go out of print.

Usually 5 star reviews are over the top and too much to actually trust. But on this occasion, I believe that the one star reveiws have missed the mark.Tolkien's works ARE extremely detailed in their nature. I agree that it slows the pace down drastically. But this isn't a quick little adventure that the characters are on. This is a long journey to save their lives, the homes, and their civilization. You can't expect to solve something so grand without writing it in a grand scale.As for those that have compared this work to an encyclopedia, it is. Look at all that Tolkien wrote about Middle-Earth. This is just one piece of the history. I, myself have yet to finish the Silmarillion do to it's extremely detailed presentation. Do I count that as a terrible book? No. Just detailed.For everyone that said the book was slow and too much, give it another chance sometime in the future. I too enjoy Terry Brooks's Shannara novels, but in my opinion those novels lack a certain amount of detail that Tolkien provides. Yes Mr. Brooks's novels are more action oriented but they lack a &quot;feel.&quot; A Tolkien novel gives me the &quot;feel&quot; of Middle-Earth. It makes that a reality.

If one reads slowly, and let Tolkien's words sink in, imagine what he describes, the reader will be taken to a magical place. Each time I read this novel, I notice something I didn't before, and it is always entertaining.

I love his work...but far too often, as in this book...it had way too many boring dull parts that dragged on. He loves being extremely detail oriented and will go off for 10 pages at a time describing the scenery and exactly how some little bush looks. It does help to bring you into the fantasy and escape from life if that is what you are looking for, but the action (that you see on the movie) is all by-passed and you only see the AFTER-EFFECTS and rarely get details of combat or anything intense as the movie tries to depict.

Then another one hit him, but he was still standing till the third one hit him. He fell on his knees and an urakie went up to him and tried to hit him in the head with an arrow. Then Aragon came and helped him and he killed the urakies, but Boramiers life was lost -- he was destined to die.

In this book, the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, many things happen to the young Hobbit, Frodo. This was a well written book, and a wonderful story.In the book, The Fellowship of the Ring, there lived a hobbit (a small creature, looking much like a man, only smaller) named Frodo Baggins. Frodo's uncle, Bilbo, came across a ring on an adventure of his. This ring, as he later found out, was the ring of power, made in the fires of Mount Doom, by Sauran, the dark lord. The man who told Bilbo about this was a wizard named Gandalf the Grey. This wizard knew that this ring had to, and could only be, destroyed in the mountain in which it was conceived. For this task, Gandalf chose Frodo. When Frodo this mission, not knowing the danger of it, he set off to Mount Doom, along with three friends to destroy the ring. On the long quest there, he stopped at Rivendale, an elven fortress, and meets with Gandalf, and various known warriors. At this meeting, a fellowship was forged; it was called the Fellowship of the Ring. This Fellowship is to protect Frodo and the evil ring. Throughout this book, this group falls apart. Some die, some are captured, but some still survive.The Fellowship of the Ring was a very well written book. It is my opinion that this is, because it presents a higher level in a book that almost all age groups read. Also, it explained things with an obvious presence of higher writing. Some examples are, the book itself, it is an example because there are no weaknesses at all in this book. The book also is a great storyline for a book. I feel this way because it shows the struggle for good or evil.In The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo Baggins goes on a dangerous quest to destroy evil for all eternity. Overall, this was a very good book. It had more than the necessary components to be called a, \\"good book\\".

They set off to destroy the Ring. Since this book is part one of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings books, the rest of the story is continued in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The characters struggle through many injuries and problems but somehow the manage to get through them.This book, although a little confusing to understand, is very well written. By \\"well written\\" I mean that it was very well thought-out and because Tolkien had a very big imagination he wrote a good story, for example he made up all the languages and places in the book. It also pulls you in making you think that you are there. The weaknesses are the book being a little confusing a pretty long. For example some of the words are hard to pronounce, like the names of people and places. Another example of it being confusing is it is a little hard to follow, you really have to pay attention to the book so you know what is going on. As long as you do this you can be sure to understand and enjoy this book.In conclusion this book was outstanding, probably the best book I've ever read. Tolkien is very imaginative and writes well. If you read this book I would recommend the other two books and the three movies that are based upon the book. If you've seen the movies I recommend the books to you. I think the best part about this book is when I finished it because I knew that there were always two more books to look forward to reading."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed the movie Lord of the Rings. This book takes you back and tells you in detail how Bilbo found the ring.

I love to read and re-read the trilogy; there is something magical about these books. Sometimes I focus on the poems, sometimes the characters, sometimes I just read them because they are familiar and comforting.This unabridged audio recording brings the book to life in a new and wonderful way. The narrator's voice is a perfect match for the story. Rob Inglis gives each character an appropriate voice, and his reading of the narrative is excellent. It's wonderful to listen to the story read aloud by such a fine actor!I've purchased dramatic abridgements of the trilogy, and was disappointed. So much was left out! With an unabridged reading, I can enjoy the whole story. If a poem or passage strikes my fancy, I can listen to it again.I am very pleased with this version, and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good audio version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have read each and every one of J.R.R. Tolkiens LOTR trilogy including 'The Hobbit' at least 6 times and I am still not tired of them. They are classics! Some people say there's too much detail. I disagree but I like detail and I think it's the mark of a great author but I understand that some people just want to read the book and not have to listen to the author describe the bark on a tree for three pages (I'm exaggerating, he doesn't go into THAT much detail). These books are great, no language, nothing inappropriate at all. If you are looking for a good book to read on a rainy day I recommend LOTR. P.S If you want to see too much detail read 'Last of the Mohicans'."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I had never read the Rings trilogy.

The world Tolkien creates is deep and amazing, and although the songs and poems get a bit tedious (especially when they're written in imaginary languages), I really got into the adventure of the characters. I read this right when I got back from Alaska and imagined the landscape to be much like that in Denali National Park."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is one book to enjoy.

There are many reluctant heroes, and many that once in a position to make a difference did. It is about friendship, honor and respect. Things the modern world has seem to forgotton.(FOR CHRISTIANS?)I hold a Doctorate in Christian Theology, and I have to say Tolkien knew what he was doing when writing. You are being ministered to...and dont even realize it. You come away from the story wanting more, craving it. Once you find the basis of his story....the Bible, and put the two together you see the kinsmenship. Middle Earth are like parables, take them as such and any doubt you may have about them will soon disapear.I will admit Fellowship is not the best of the four books (JUST my opinion) but that is not to say it does not blow away most modern books...because it was an absolute blessing to me, and an eye opener on who I wanted to be."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"If you were a little Halfling called a \\"Hobbit\\" and all of a sudden a ring of power and evil comes to you, what would you do? This book shows how two hobbits come together and gain many friends on their way to destroy the one ring in the fires of Mount Doom which lurks in the land of Mordor.The rings of power were crafted by the elves. Three rings for the Elvin lords under the sky. Seven for the Dwarf lords in their halls of stone. And nine, nine for the race of men who above all else desire power. But they were all of them deceived for one other ring was made. In the fires of Mount Doom, Souron the deceiver made one more ring in which he poured all of his cruelty in. with that all of Middle fell to his hand.But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched to the gates of Mordor and fought there. Then the King Isildur picked up his fathers shattered blade and cut the ring of Sourons hand. A thousand years later a creature named Gollum. There the ring stayed for a thousand years until the ring abandoned Gollum. But something happened that the ring did not see. It was picked up by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. The ring was passed down to Frodo Baggins of the Shire. He will now set out on a journey to destroy the ring of power. Now it's up to you, do you think he will destroy the ring, or will he get captured?I thought this was a great book to read. It showed: respect, honor, courage, and friend ship.

It has everything you need: magic, might, swords, sorcery-but with one difference: Tolkien is able to make all these elements, put them all together and make it all seem real. While you read The Fellowship of the Ring, you feel as if Middlearth is a real place and that the characters are real too. I have never gotten so into a book series as Tolkien's Lord of The Ring. People sometimes say Fantasy is stupid or weird. I woudl agree for the most part (sorry). Then one day on a lark, I read The Hobbit and it changed my perspective. I came to realize that Fanstasy (as a genre) can be as respectable as mainstream literature. Tolien is a literaty genius.

You can still feel the freshness and innovation that marked the beginning of his genre. Almost any reader will have to confess that there are tedious parts, but they enrich the storyline and add a depth possessed by few other worlds. The characters are alive and breathing. The humor is memorable and the friendships lasting. Tolkien describes everything, giving the world a feeling of reality. Modern day fantasy sometimes gives the impression of being a movie or TV show. There's nothing but exciting parts and footage seems to be cut out. There are two or three points of major crisis in The Fellowship. In modern fantasy it's ten, twenty, thirty times, vainly trying to get a rise out of the reader. The Fellowship and the remainder of Lord of the Rings is the work of a man who invites you to live in his world and doesn't apply the impatient force of constant action and employ all the usual gimmicks. Many people criticize the flow of Tolkien's writing, but his books are fantasy in its purest form. This book is a must-read for more than its entertainment value. The Lord of the Rings is the key to understanding the genre. All fantasy books that follow the Ring Trilogy have definite roots to the father of them all. If you read through The Fellowship and its sequels and are still hungry for more, I would recommend Brooks and Eddings, my favorites."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Now that our friend Potter is taking all the glory, I thought it was a good idea to go back to basic.

I was scared to live in a big city for the first time in my life, so I comforted myself by inhabiting Middle-Earth for a while. The sense of location in this book is palpable; from Rivendell to Lorien, from Bree to Weathertop to the Mines of Moria, one feels as if one has truly visited the locations described.The structure of LOTR is in the manner of a picaresque -- the callow hobbits journey across a wide world and have various adventures on their quest to deposit the Ring in Mt. Doom. Characterization is for the most part simplistic, but Frodo and Gollum achieve some depth, and the story throughout has the force of myth, full of rich archetypes. One ought to read this book the way one might read Homer or Chaucer: it is an old-fashioned epic, drawn in broad, bold strokes. It is a spectacularly successful exercise in literary nostalgia."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is fascinating from cover to cover. Tolkien is at his very best in this book, wielding adjectives about Middle Earth that make it seem so believable I felt I was actually there, and unlike so many fantasy books today, the plot and character development don't take a back seat. It's one huge tour-de-force that is just hurled at you. Some people will argue that it's just too boring, and I'll go with you on that, but that's no reason not to like the book. I guarantee that half of the people who say that didn't get past the first hundred pages. What we have here is a masterpiece of fantasy and fiction, and a fine line drawn between a fantasy world and the real world, and Tolkien gives us an epic fantasy that will stay in the mind's of it's readers for years to come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It is hard to get into the book at the front of it but after about 100 pages or so it gets pretty good.

To say you saw the movie and were then disappointed that the book was so different and should have stuck to Jackson's version should be tested for crack usageSecond, Tolkien is DEAD and has been dead for decades! It took him 14 years to write the Fellowship, it was published in 1954, and he was already OLD by then!

Of course Tolkien's writing is horribly slow at times and overdescribed on others. This guy was a PROFESSOR, he worked his whole life in the field of Languages.

This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves.

He eventually became a profess of anglo-saxon there in Oxford. Lord of the Rings was published in 1954.The first part, Fellowship of the Ring, was about a young hobbit who inherits a very powerful ring that changes his life greatly. His mind is opened to things that occur outside the peaceful life in the shire, his home. He has to change from a peaceful hobbit minding his own business into a courageous hero.The book was very entertaining. After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book. The book offers many more details that were not in the movie. Many scenes that were in the movie are lengthened. Many events in the book aren't even mentioned in the movie. Even some new characters that aren't mentioned in the movie are in the book. However after seeing the movie, some parts of the book were portrayed in the movie were less interesting and hard to read through. That contributed to the length of time it took me to read the book.

I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a snoozer. The book could have at least a hundred pages cut from it simply by eliminating the endless descriptions of nature that the band is travelling through. Another thing that I found annoying was the portrayal of elves - why are they always relegated to living in magical forests, where they possess great wisdom and power, but never use it? Just to say I've read them, I will probably force myself to read the next two volumes.

One of them (Bilbo Baggins) contained something of great value to out side the shier. The shier is where the hobbits lived, far out of where wars and conflicts are. There are darker races like Orks, Goblins and Ring wraiths. They want what Bilbo has, the ring. The ring is known to control evil and destroy all that was good to middle earth. Bilbo was ready to leave the shier and move on; he left the ring with his nephew Frodo Baggins. They had no idea it was the most powerful ring of all and everyone was looking for it. An old friend of Bilbo, Gandolf knew what it was and sent Frodo and Sam to travel a distance and help them destroy the ring.One of my most favorite parts in the story is when J.R.R Tolkien described how the shier looked. The detail he put in and how things were, the houses the field the hobbit nationality. When I was done I could clearly see everything about the shier. I think J.R.R Tolkien wanted his audience to know excaclty what he wants you to see in your head. He also left room for imagination. Reading it was exciting, though some parts were sort of boring and I could define some of the words used in the book but I got most of it. Another one of my favorite parts through out the story is when Frodo and his crew of hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry) were camping out with there new friend strider, strider went out and on the lookout and handed the hobbits swords for defense, the ring wraiths found them and stabbed Frodo. Then an elf rider came to pick up Frodo and cure with elfish medicine. On the way nine ring wraiths came to take them out. When J.R.R was telling what happened it felt as if you were right there with them. Intense and extreme feelings were cool. I like how he even wrote in elfish language when the elf rider was talking to her horse. Those were my most favorite moments in the book. Also that merry and pippin made me laugh in some parts because they were funny characters. It was good to hear humor in the book with merry and pippin.

In The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien a malicious ring is passed on to a young hobbit. The hobbit though is doomed to take the ring and destroy it at on of the darkest corners of the earth. However, black riders that work for Sauron (the creator of the ring who rules them all) want the master ring and want to kill him. the nine black riders,(sent by sauron) are owners of the nine other rings which are specially made for them.I think this is not a boring book but a different book that is just a different way of writing. I think it is very cult. I also think it is obviously very fictional and it is a book that is also very adventurous and mysterious. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a classic and cultural book. I warn though, that when reading, the person needs to have patience if they think \\"Book 1\\" is too boring to read. I you are a person that likes only the books like the Da Vinci Code which is a thriller you wont like it that much. However, someone that likes Science Fiction will like it, since it is a very mysterious book that has from evil rings, to adventurous hobbits.Though most of the book is pretty boring it does include mystery especially after the council of Elrond, when the fellowship sees the glowing eyes appearing and disappearing into the darkness of their journey."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I remembered from years ago when I first read The Lord of the Rings trilogy that these were really wonderful books.

If you like fantasy books, you will be delighted with this book. With all its action, you will definitely be experiencing cliffhangers. It has a truckload of different creatures, some good and bad.

Either way, this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien starts up slowly, but then it gets a little more exiting (especially if you are into dungeons and dragons.)This is a very good book out of a series, that you must read (I would recommend you to read the Hobbit first, it will give you an idea of the story and the settings.) But if you start with this book, you will get the story even if you don't read the Hobbit.The Fellowship of the Ring is about an evil ring who by destiny was given to Frodo who is Bilbo's nephew. So a wizard advises Frodo to destroy it in the place it was made. By trying to accomplish this goal Frodo has many adventures and surprises and meets many different people hobbits, humans and elves.Beware there's a lot of strange, made-up words and there is a lot of songs in this book. I think you can just skip them, because for me they don't make any sense and are placed there just to keep you in suspense."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Forever a classic this one.

This is such an incredible book, but it doesn't make any since whatsoever if you don't read The Hobbit (also by Tolkien) first! The Hobbit is a lot more fast-paced (and shorter) for you people who thought the Fellowship of the rings dragged itself out. (which it did for a very good reason,to explain a bit of history that comes in very important later on,if you read the other books)So don't give this book a bad review if you haven't read the book that explains it or haven't even finished the trilogy, it gives this really good book a bad name which is the least it deserves!

He also wrote The Hobbit and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. It is a book mostly for adults, but a bright sixth grader can read it. Do not be surprised if you do not like the beginning. The beginning is slow, but the story gets better as it goes along.This book is the first book of a series of three. This book is adventure genre that takes place in middle earth. They tell of a very powerful ring forged by a dark lord. This ring is full of evil and very tempting. Anyone who puts the ring on turns invisible.A group of people set out to destroy this ring of evil. Some of these people were the elf, Legolas, the royal humans Boromir and Aragorn son of Arathorn, and the dwarf, Gimli. They encounter merciless orcs and fearsome ringwraiths on their journey. Can they go to Mount Doom and destroy the ring of evil without being killed? Find out.I did not really care for this book. Sometimes it was so boring I had to force myself to keep reading. I think that this man does not know how to make an exciting book. Some parts did not make sense also. To me, he seems to describe things too much. He also goes on and on and on. I found the movie to be a lot more interesting, exciting and make more sense. My teacher says that J.K.

Granted it opened up many doors for the half hearted fantasy writing of today, it still used plane, boring and ohhhhh so long descriptions. What I don't understand is how JRR Tolkien could take a great idea about four young chaps (who happen to be midgets which kills alot of the drama for me) on a harrowing adventure to destory the ring that the evil one wants so he can take over middle-Earth. The whole book went through a phase of Duex Machinea where Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin where either saved by friendly hobbits, not so friendly hobbits, friendly Elves, not so friendly Elves, or friendly Men or not so friendly Men. Startaling trasitions from numbly simiple to madingly difficult dialog made the book jump from one pace to another. Tolkien didn't use mounting suspense through the book, but manic-depressive, spasmatic jumps. Putting a song in the middle of one of the few exciting scenes breaks the pace, and leaves the reader starting all over again, feeling bland. Altogether, the book was my least favorite \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the absolute worst book ever written. I still can't believe they killed off Frodo, the supposed star of the trilogy, within 175 pages. That's just ridiculous. Also, what's the deal with the zombies??? I re-read that section 3 times and I still didn't get it. Did they eat Gandalf or not? I still don't know.

Suddenly this series I bought to &quot;fill in the gap&quot; became something better than anything Rowling ever wrote in a book. Tolkien gives a far more vivid world, much more complex, with characters that are far more three dimensional. I can't understand why there is so much buzz around Harry Potter when the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is so much a better fantasy story. Then again, it is written above a second grade level."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"One of the things that was a little tough about finally reading the fellowship of the ring was the fact that I am used to reading thriller novels and historical fiction. Therefore the language of this book took some getting used to. I felt at times that I was wading my way through some slow parts. But slow compared to the stuff I usually read I guess. So I have to take that into consideration. This was worth reading and I am glad I did.

There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is a wonderful introduction to Middle Earth and it's residents. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As so many cynnical people deftly point out, most of this book is &quot;just people walking around doing stuff.&quot; However can't anything be reduced to utter simplicity?

So, with that cleared up this book perfectly sets up the stage for the next two. Please consider that the trilogy is written continuosly, and is in excess of one thousand pages.

This is a good introduction to the final two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"With great action and suspense I believe this is one of the best books i've read so far.

Along his way Frodo meets many characters with different personalities. After travelling near to Sauron's country, Mordor, Frodo finds out that one of his trusted companions wants to take the ring and rule for himself. He is faced with tons of enemies and then finds that one of his own friends is one of them. He uses the ring, which makes him invisible, and escapes.

I started with Clarke's 2001 a Space Odessey, Asimov's Foundation, continued with the Tolkien's Hobbit and Herbert's Dune. Don't get me wrong, Tolkien is a master, and I loved this book, but I thought it was very slow, and very little action. The best book ever as some have said? I thought Dune by Frank Herbert was a much more intriguing read, with much more &quot;depth&quot; but still, I'm glad I read it as it was enjoyable and I want to read the other books. I just didn't &quot;blow me away&quot; as it did other readers. Maybe I'm shallow, but I failed to see the signifigance. Tolkien sometimes puts too much in the journey, and not enough problems for characters to deal with. I liked the Hobbit MUCH more, though I understand the series continues and isn't finished. I would still recommend you read it, but try your hand at Dune first."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"to all who have never read this book, and to all who have found it boring, I am forced to tell you I couldn't care less. To those of you who find the books rich in symbolism, let me just say that Tolkien despised symbolism, and allegory, and other tricks writers use to inspire depth in their works. tolkien simply wrote and let his works stand for themselves. while current fantasy readers are inclined towards the &quot;brute force&quot; angles of fantasy, in which mighty wizards throw fireballs all day long and retire on dragonback at the end of the day(Jordan and Goodkind, I AM talking to you!), Tolkien created a world in which power is wielded with care, the meek overcome the mighty through humane virtue, and magic itself is falling into darkness. this is a parable of our times, fantasy or no, and it pains me that Tolkien's works have been relegated to the realm of Jordan and Terry Brooks: his place is in high literature. if you hate fantasy, it doesn't matter- savor his words, cry for the woes he shows you, marvel at the depth of his imagination. just don't dismiss his work as fantasy; he deserves better than that. as I said, the works stand for themselves."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"One of the major comments you will hear about this book is that it is a bit slow getting started. But hang in there and get through the set up; its SO worth it! Even the parts of the book characterized as slow are useful; this exposition helps immerse you into Middle Earth, which is one of the more common positive comments you will read about here in the reviews. Reading LOTR is a commitment, treating it like a weekend novel will result in disappointment. But when you are on the edge of your seat as the fog closes in on the hobbits on the Barrow-Downs, or letting the phone ring off the hook, forgotten, as Glorfindel urges his horse to flee with Frodo on its back at the attack of the Ringwraiths at the Ford of Brunien, you will be glad you took the time to do it right. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The primary influence of this work is deeper than storytelling. If you read the Lord of the Rings, it will change your life for the better. Some perceive the changes immediately; others perceive them over time. As Gollum descended into shadow, you will rise from it. If you have not read the book, I'm sure these comments sound contrived and condescending. After you read the Lord of the Rings, you will get a feeling for what I am trying to express. The reason the Lord of the Rings is so popular is because it has a profound psychological effect on virtually everyone who reads it. This influence is pervasive and obviously not the reaction of just a few fanatics. The most mysterious aspect of this is the fact the influence becomes more profound with subsequent readings. You will get more out of the book on the second or third reading than the first. Middle-Earth becomes a place you will visit over time and this is one of the few books that you will read again and again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I started this book.

The Fellowship was here to introduce the characters that would become of great importance later on in the series.

I was stunned by the amazing ability possessed by the author, Tolkien, to create such a masterpiece. Being the first author to write books that belong to this genre, I think that Tolkien should be honoured and respected by any fantasy-lover. This book includes a serious study and realistic description of characters and their motives, beautiful descriptions of Middle Earth and its different cultures, and, of course, an interesting and complex plot. The fantasy books I had read before were merely average, and thus, when I started to read this book, I had low expectations. However, the book became better and better as I read, and impressed me in a way that I cannot begin to describe. If only modern writers had half the talent and imagination possessed by tolkien.

The attention to detailed history, fictitious though it is, is amazing. Blended with a pinch of magic and a touch of good humor, the story is gripping. The struggle between Mordor and the rest of Middle-Earth is always present, whether the characters are in the comfort of a nice, soft bed, or in a dank cave or tunnel. Middle-Earth, Tolkien's realm of storytelling, is so diverse and ever-changing, that no matter how many new places the hobbits or any other member of their fellowship visit, it's never just another stop along the way.

Tolkien is a classic. If you haven't read this book your missing out. It is one of the best-selling books of all time and I can see why. The eloquent vocabulary and side storylines are what make this book great, along with the incredible sensory detail which prints a picture in your head of exactly what the author means to tell you. It's less like reading and more like imagining.The story takes place in a pre-medieval age but not in Europe, in a place called Middle Earth. Middle Earth is inhabited by many magical creatures including elfs, men, wizards, orcs, dwarfs, dragons, monsters of all sorts, and hobbits. A hobbit is a smaller version of a man, only 3 or so feet tall. Our story follows Frodo Baggins, a small but curios hobbit on his adventure to overcome evil and destroy the one magic ring that can cast the entire Middle Earth into darkness if it falls into the hands of the evil being Sauron. He created the ring in the volcano Mount Doom and is the only one who can control the power within this ring. Frodo must take the ring into the heart of the volcano which is the one place the it can be destroyed. He is aided on his quest by his three hobbit friends, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadock Brandybuck, and Perigren Took, two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf. Together they set out to destroy the ring and save the world from the powers of evil.I would recommend this book for kids and adults over they age of 12. This is because the vocabulary and depth of the story are almost to hard for a child to comprehend, let alone be interested by. Also some knowledge of medieval times helps greatly to understand this book. Overall I give this book 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Take a head-trip to wonderland of the medieval times in J.R.R.

Envision their every movement as they brave dark, treacherous, caves, and as they fend off their attackers of trolls,orcs, goblins, and other unknown evils in their perilous quest. Tolkien's tapestry of history and thought throughout the book is incredible as he weaves his complicated history of his imagined world and flawlessly brings the book right out of the pages and into your room. His novel inspires everyone to do what is the courageous and right thing to do in their everyday lives to bring evil to its knees and to promote righteousness in the sinning environment we live in today.Frodo Baggins is the main character in this action and adventure series. He and his comical looking friends add humor to the violent scheme and his other counterpart, Gandalf the wizard, expresses his wisdom throughout dramatic scenes.

Little did Frodo know that he would one day have to leave the dear Shire to go on a wild adventure to the darkest of all places.When Frodo was young he was adopted by Bilbo Baggins and was loved dearly. Bilbo was a rich hobbit and lived in the fairest hobbit hole. He gave the hole to Frodo when he left the Shire. Bilbo also left behind a very precious gift to him, a golden ring that had magical powers and could be very dangerous. Gandalf, an old wizard and a great family friend, made sure that Frodo got it and kept it safe. In the movie Frodo leaves the Shire with the ring almost immediately with Sam and ends up bumping into Mary and Pippin on the way. In the book it is a lot more complicated and more interesting too. Shortly after Gandalf left he came back to tell Frodo that the ring was evil and need to be taken away soon because it belonged to Sauron, who was evil.Eventually Frodo, Sam, Mary and Pippin left quietly on an adventure that would last forever. From the time they left the Shire to the time they got to Mordor there was not one time where they were not in danger. On this adventure they meet many new and interesting people, such as elves, and learn many things about life and the world around them. You follow these amazing hobbits through a wonderful, but dangerous adventure through all different types of unknown places.This is an excellent book. Most people have seen the movie and so have I, but the book answered all my questions about the movie. The book is just as interesting too. You can see everything clearly in your mind. Then the next time you watch the movie everything seems to piece together like a puzzle and you catch things you never would have noticed before. Read this book, it is excellent!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is a virtuoso performance by Rob Inglis. His portrayals of all the characters is superb, and he (almost) never mixes up their voices. His understanding and interpretation of Tolkien is marvelous, and he has the perfect voice for the job. Wouldn't it have been nice if Jackson could have found a role for Rob Ingis in the films? He'd have made a great Tom Bombadil, but let's not get into that.An earlier reviewer pointed out the problem of inconsistent disc and track naming, but that flaw exists with the online database, not the CDs themselves.For any fan of the book or the films, get these audio CDs. Nothing better on a long drive."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Even today, almost six decades since its first publication, J. R. R. Tolkien's magnificent work of fantasy is still attracting readers and scholars - more so now due to the publicity surrounding Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy. Perhaps for the first time ever, the movie release of a book adaptation has actually boosted sales of the book involved. And this can only be considered a good thing, as one cannot claim to be a literary reader without exploring Tolkien's Middle-Earth at least once in their lives.To outline the story seems almost redundant, but here goes: in the idyllic pastoral land of the Shire lives the hobbit Frodo Baggins, who is intrusted with an immense task. The magical Ring that his uncle brought back from his adventuring is revealed by the wizard Gandalf to be none other than the ruling Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is now mustering his forces to find his possession and overthrow the world once more.And so Frodo sets off, with his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippen Took, and his loyal gardener Samwise Gamgee in order to conceal the Ring from the enemy and seek out a way in which to destroy it. His journey throws him into the path of the mysterious Ranger Strider, and the terrible Ringwraiths sent out to fetch Sauron's prize. Finally reaching the elven sanctuary of Rivendell, Frodo becomes a part of a larger Fellowship of men, hobbits, elves and dwarves, in order to make the perilous journey across land to the volcanic Mount Doom in the land of Mordor: the only place where the Ring could be destroyed.On the way of course are dangers galore - the betrayal of the white wizard Saruman, the legions of orcs plaguing the land, the pattering footsteps of an unknown stalker, and of course the lure of the One Ring itself, whose corruptible nature endangers Frodo from within the Fellowship as well as without...\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first of the three books in the trilogy, which in turn are divided into six books (two books for each volume). This new edition of the text involves several new additions; a note explaining Tolkien's terminology and linguistic decisions (such as writing \\"elven\\" instead of \\"elfin\\" and \\"dwarves\\" instead of \\"dwarfs\\"), a foreword by Tolkien himself explaining how the story came about, and the famous prologue \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which introduces the reader to the culture of these small creatures and the history of the Ring that took place in \\"The Hobbit\\". Then of course there are the meticulous maps of Middle-earth, and the wonderful story itself.In creating his work, Tolkien had done something that no author had done before, or since (despite the dismal attempts at copying by the likes of...well, I'll let you fill in the blanks) - the creation of an entire world, complete with history, flora, fauna, landmarks, star plotting, folksongs and a thousand other details that make Middle-Earth the most vivid and three-dimensional sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen. In many ways the land itself is the protagonist of the story - it is what the characters are fighting for, and at times the land itself helps or hinders the Fellowship's progress.You can read this story from a thousand different viewpoints, whether it's the irrevocable fading of the magic in the world, the battle between good and evil (both internal and external), a beautiful love story between a mortal man and an elven maiden, the impossible journey of the ordinary-man to change to course of the world...the list goes on. Most touching for me however was the gentle touches of Christian idealogy imbued and combined with the realms of Faery, creating a harmonious and magical whole, not as heavy handed as C. S. Lewis's Narnia allegories, but meaningful, deep and beautiful.In reading \\"Fellowship\\" for the first time, one may be put off by the rather slow pace of the first book, in which Tolkien takes his time to set the scene, establish what's at stake, gather together his information and then throw in a singing Tom Bombadil. Trust me, if you hang in there to book two (when Frodo reaches Rivendell) then the pace will pick up.Tolkien has a beautiful poetic prose used throughout the story, sometimes soft and gentle, sometimes grand and epic. There has never been a better time to get involved with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" than with the release of Jackson's movie trilogy on DVD - read the book, and then watch the world unfold on the television screen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"&quot;One Ring to rule them all.

In this book, Tolkien develops the characters and backgrounds of the story and also includes suspense and excitement along the way.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.When you buy this, you might as well buy all three books of the rings set because it is essentially one story divided into three books. This book does not complete the story but only a section of it.And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books that make up the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Its about a simple hobbit named Frodo Baggins who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. He soon learns from a wizard named Gandalf that the ring isn't just any ring, it is the most powerful ring ever made. Now he is sent on a quest to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom before the Dark Lord, Sauron, finds it. If it ever got into his hands, the word would turn to darkness and all things once peaceful and beautiful would be destroyed and Sauron would rule the world.Frodo and Samwise Gamgee then go on an adventure together with seven other companions. These seven are: a dwarf named Gimli, an elf named Legolas, two men named Boromir and Aragorn, and two hobbits named Merry and Pippin (Gandalf also joins them for a little while). Merry and Pippin are bothe cousins of Frodo while Samwise is his faithful gardener. Frodo is a normal hobbit who loves food and friends. He is also the kindest person Sam knows. Aragorn is the heir of a great kingdome who has finally decided to take up his throne. Boromir it the son of the steward of that kingdome who wishes to represent it by joing the company. Legolas is the prince of a far away forest and Gimli is a well respected dwarf.The beginning of the book is a little boring but it pays off when their quest begins and conflicts begin to come up. In the beginning, Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam begin their journey alone through their country called the Shire to a little town called Bree to meet Gandalf. After going through and meeting new and interesting people and being chased by Black Riders (servants of Sauron), they finally make it to Bree. The trouble is, Gandalf isn't there!Can the whole world depend on hobbits to save them from destruction? Will Gandalf ever come to Bree? How can the hobbits go on without him?

It just got boring after a few pages discribing tiny detail.I lost interest during the climax, and put it down for what I meant only to be that day, but ended up being several months. When I finally picked it back up, and managed to finish it, I really didn't feel fulfilled.There were good things about the book, like the overall story.But it could have been a huge amount better. Like if they shortened the detail to like a page per place, and blew up the important events more, rather than letting peaceful moments dominate the story.It could just be that I need to read it again. I sometimes find that the second time around is more enjoyable.Overall, I thought it was perhaps worth the chore of reading it, but would have enjoyed it more if the detail hadn't droned on quite so long.Oh, by the way, I'm halfway through The Two Towers book, and it's much better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I would give this book two thumbs up. I read its pre-quil, The Hobbit, it was excellent as well and helped to understand this book. The Lord of Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a book that is placed in an earth-like world, but it isn't earth. The time would be medievalish, with such things as dragons, orcs, elves, dwarfs, wizards, trolls, and hobbits of course, plus many other creatures. The content of this book is very similar to that of an AD&D (advanced dungeons & dragons) storyline. This story starts off at a mild pace, a peaceful setting in the hobbit town known as The Shire. The story is about one hobbit, Frodo Baggins. His long time friend Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, visits him and that is when the story really takes off. They set out on many adventures, most of them unintentional. This story is filled with adventure, and the suspense never stops throughout the duration of the story. There is a great conflict between the good and evil in Middle Earth, where the story takes place. Evil forces are threatening to destroy everything good in the world, Frodo and his fellowship set off to prevent that from happening. If you like all of these things that I have just described, this book if definitely for you. It has one of the best storylines I have ever read. It helps to read The Hobbit first however, it will give you a much greater understanding of what is going on. This story doesn't end in this book, it stops right in the middle. To finish the story you have to read the next two books, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As a lover of Science Fiction and a moderate consumer of fantasy, this book easily ranks up there with the best either has to offer. Dune and Ender's Game being personal favorites, this book offers elements that were never attained in either of the aforementioned. In particular, the details with which Tolkein encapsulated the true settings and feelings of places and characters is unmatched. Like another reviewer remarked, I have to agree that this novel was not written to give the reader a symbolic hidden message underneath the beauty of his writing, but rather entertain the reader with a land of magic and fantastical delight. I have yet to read a novel where i thought it would be astonishing to see how a movie could be made based on this. I am afraid that there is no way possible a movie will encompass what Tolkein has created and that those who fall victim to exchanging the reading for the viewing of the movie will be at a loss. Simply wonderful."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book shoves off the greatest trilogy ever written. Some people might say that it is long-winded and boring. Obviously these people are (...). They need to stick with their R.L. Stein and take another dose of those nummy medications.

It was slow and after three chapters of dragging myself through it, i returned it wondering what was so great about it. a year later, i was brousing for a book to read when it caught my eye. I was incredibly bored so I decided to give it another try. Afterall, fantasy is my favorite genre. From then on i was caught. I read the book three times and loved ALL the characters, (even the EVIL Sauron, which,i admit, is odd). The middle earth is so believable that for days after i expected to find orcs lurking about at night.

This, the endless mentions of places, people, and things that have nothing to do whatsoever with the central plot; the mind-boggling barrage of songs and poems; and the book's drudging pace curbed all of the enthusiasm I had going into reading this epic story. The story itself is creative and wonderful; of course, how couldn't it be and be so popular. \\"The Hobbit,\\" though, was a much better reading experience in both style and pace. It had a clear beginning, middle and ending. \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" seems from the beginning to concentrate so much on laying down the foundation for the trilogy, that it really doesn't move. The ending is not an ending at all, but the most blatant lead-in to a sequel you could imagine. I expected a lead-in, but I didn't expect that this book would end completely unresolved in every way. Also, so many of the character's physical descriptions are so vague that I still can't really say what the difference between a dwarf and an elf is. What does an orc look like? I'm not too sure, yet the geography is often described in painful detail. Now I understand all the dubious remarks about this book that have kept me from reading it over the years. It's good and agonizing to read at the same time. In my case, the agony wins out."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is probably the most loved epic fantasy series ever written. From the first pages when Bilbo Baggins makes his secret departure from Hobbiton, you are drawn in to this lush story. Tolkien tells a wonderful story and is able to do that while keeping the reader hooked from page 1.&quot;Fellowship&quot; is the start of the trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; In this first installment, Bilbo Baggins leaves Hobbiton and leaves The One Ring in the hands of his cousin, Frodo Baggins. When gandalf the Grey tells of brewing trouble the Hobbit says he's going to move to Buckland. He departs on a quest that will change his life forever. He takes along friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The hobbits finally reach Rivendell and an important counsel is held. This is the point in the book where the plot starts to skyrocket. To tell you any more on the plot would most likely ruin your reading.Tolkien's detail on nature and history is astounding and only makes the novel even greater. He is always describing the surroundings and I just couldn't get enough of it. Some may not like this detail because they say Tolkien just drags on and on. This couldn't be furthur from the truth. His detail only adds to this beautiful story.For those of you that are interested in reading this book because you loved the movie need to know what you are getting into. This is the start of one of the biggest and best fantasy epics of all time. Don't think that you're going to be opening a book that anybody can handle. That is not the case. Only people that are willing to make a commitment to a fabulous and sometimes complicated novel should buy this.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is most likely the best fantasy epic of our time. There is not enough that one could say about such a riveting novel. I strongly recommend this to anyone that is interested in a wonderful fantasy that is willing to make a commitment.

Personally I have never liked such titles, but I will say this is an amazing work. J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination is matched only by that of Frank Herbert, in my humble opinion.The novel starts off innocently enough with the departure of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who was the hero in The Hobbit. Soon, however, we learn that one of the items his nephew Frodo inherited is not as it seems. It's belongs to Sauron, the Dark Lord who, for ages, as tormented Middle Earth. Thus begins a journey of epic proportions.Tolkien developed full-fledged languages for the various races which inhabit Middle-Earth, inlcuding the Elves, Dwarves and others. He also developed a history for all the peoples which gives the story added depth, a depth unparalleled in fantasy novels which attempt to recreate the magic of this work. Authors such as Robert Jordan would do well to re-read this novel and learn the fact that sometimes brevity is best. Tolkien has the ability to give the reader enough information to make the story interesting while not loading him/her down with useless details.The reader will, by the end of the novel feel as if he/she has read a history of a world gone by, a place which truly exists. You will find yourself wanting to visit the Shire, to walk down the old road to Rivendell and visit the elves who dwell there. From the fields of Hollin to the darkness of Moria and the evil power dwelling in Barad-Dur, this novel is excellent. If you read only one novel this year, read The Lord Of The Rings."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Few can compare to Tolkien for fantasty writing. Every time I pick up this series I find myself astounded by the beauty of the writing and the richness of the characters. It's different now that I've seen the movies. I find myself trying to picture places and things from viewing them on the TV screen instead of relying on my imagination more. Once I finally start to imagine things again though it's like Dorothy stepping into Oz - full blown color, brilliant scenery and fantastic creatures that I've known since I was a child.One of my favorite characters was left out of the movies and, while at first I was disappointed, getting reacquainted with him in reading was made even more pleasurable. Tom Bombadil, in Tolkien's own words, is an enigma. He does not fit the molds, fantastic though they may be, created for the other races and characters. In speaking to my dad about this read through I mentioned that it's incredible to me how Tolkien wrote in such a distinct way, not only in describing and speaking as individual people in the book, but also how sweeping he wrote about their races as a whole. When the Hobbits speak, they are Hobbits. The same with the race of man, elves, dwarfs and even the council-folk. Each voice carries the weight of history of their kind behind it and that's not an easy thing to accomplish and one that, in my opinion, is often forgotten about or overlooked.I love re-reading these books. I still feel the same thrill when Elrond says, \\".. This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great\\". I still quake with fear when the drums beat deep within the heart of Khazad-dum. I wonder at the description of Galadriel but still can feel a kinship with the longing for home and a hearth that Sam often wishes for.

Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring has a plot and storyline superior to most books that I have read. I loved reading it to the end. Tolkien set out to create something far different than what had been made up until this point: Just a regular story with little background on the characters and places. Tolkien created something a thousand times better. He did a great job introducing all of the characters and actually writes about them in such a way that makes you feel like they are real. The plot is very original, especially for the time period that it was written in, and shows the thought and time that Tolkien put into writing it. Throughout the book, the reader is able to picture some amazing things in their mind, and allowed to really create his or her own world based on what Tolkien has written. The reader can visualize the different places and people in the book, and it is fun to do so.As for the characters themselves, there are quite a few of them. They each have a mind of their own, with all of them coming together seamlessly and creating a great book. One of the characters that I think is most significant is Frodo Baggins. He is a hobbit, a normal half-ling, that gets thrown into a quest to save Middle-Earth, and I like how Tolkien didn't try to create some supernatural character for this story to accomplish this task. Frodo had many flaws and had to overcome his weaknesses.Although it is one of the best books that I have read, there are a few minor criticisms that I have for the Fellowship of the Rings. Since Tolkien spends so much time describing the story and since he needs to explain so much, the book does become slow during multiple points of the book, as some other people have mentioned. However, most books have slow points, and this really is not a true reason why anyone should not read the book. I personally think that so much description adds to the high level of praise this book deservesAnother setback is that the story gets confusing due to all of the places and people of Middle-Earth, and the events that take place in the book. It makes it hard to follow and you might end up with a need to reread some of the pages to fully get a grasp on what is happening.Overall, this is an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone that loves fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is perfect for the person with time on their hands.

That is to say, to most of us.If you are afraid of the length and wordiness of the story, I still suggest you give the book a try: even if you find yourself skimming descriptive parts, you will still get something out of this book. Perhaps later you will want to reread it and see what else you can get out of it, but even if you do not, you will still have gotten something from it in one quick read.Also, to those of you who have read \\"The Hobbit\\" and did not enjoy it: I urge you to try the Lord of the Rings anyway. The difficulty I had with The Hobbit didn't continue through the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit seemed more like a delightful but light children's adventure, while the Lord of the Rings is much deeper. The two works have extremely different tones, so they might appeal to different audiences. The Lord of the Rings beautifully enthralling while also thought-provoking. Even with its darkness, it is, in the end, ultimately comforting."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" more than a couple of times in the past but was admittedly leary about the \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\". Perhaps the size of the collection was intimidating...I am so glad I got over that!! I just recently finished part 1, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and am currently working on \\"The Two Towers.\\" The books are absolutely mind-boggling!! They start up right where \\"The Hobbit\\" leaves off and are nothing short of adventurous and other-worldly. Tolkein creates a world of elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and men that is fantastical in scope yet wholly believable. Tolkein knows how to pit evil against good in an epic and spectacular way.I would literally stay up nights until 2am with my little reading light, driving my husband crazy because I simply couldn't rest until I got to the end. I feel the same way about the second book! What's more is that I've read that the third book, \\"The Return of the King\\" is even better and I couldn't be more excited to get into it.If you are a lover of good books and have been avoiding \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because of all of its current movie hype, I can assure you it would be a foolish thing to pass up. Also, if you really want to start off right, begin with \\"The Hobbit\\" (if you have lots of time on your hands I would suggest starting with \\"The Silmarillion\\" which is the start of it all).Tolkein was a world famous philologist and created his own \\"Elvish\\" language to create these books. They are perfect for readers young (young adult) and old and are a true means of escape from reality.Let this be the review that gets you started on the reading adventure of a lifetime, one you'll likely never forget."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the only work of fantasy prose in the last millenium which deserves all the awards which could be awarded to it. Tolkien outdoes himself with this first installment in the world famous trilogy, exceeding all limits with his creation of a new world, characters so deep you'll never be able to get yourself out of their heads after the first fifty pages, and a plot so complicated, and yet easy to understand for the reader, that the first time I read it, (when I was seven or eight), I knew that it was the best work of fantasy that I would ever read. I read it, read the other two of the trilogy, and read them all again, and again, and again, and I have read them at least once annually since. When you look at the trilogy all together, it looks like you'll never finish it, but the key to that is to read the first one, without thinking how long the others are. You'll love them, these priceless gems of fantasy from the mind of a genious, I garuntee it.This edition is an example of a faithful unaltered or abriged, true to the author edition that you can trust, and read over and over, until it falls apart. I recommend it.The plot centers around a ring, made in the distant past, which was created to give the dark lord Sauron the power to overrun middle earth with darkness and untold malice. He made the ring in the volcano in the middle of his dark kingdom, and that it the only place where it can be destroyed. But it was stolen from him. Follow the adventures of a Hobbit (a small sort of person, like a dwarf, but without the beard) to whom the ring has passed. Finding out what the ring is, and who is looking for it, Frodo Baggins, with his servant Samwise, set out to bring the ring to the Cracks of Doom, and destroy it once and for all."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It took seeing the wonderful movie version to finally make me read this book and for that I am grateful. I had read the Hobbit and enjoyed it but never finally felt compelled to pick up J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring. The characters of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and Gandalf are more complex than I expected and I loved the slow build up as both dread and unbearable tension are increased with every step on their long journey. The novel has a quicker pace after the Council of Elrond and the previously established atmosphere is put to good use and delivers on all its promises. How I missed this book during my nerdy teenage years will always remain a mystery. I am only thankful I have opened myself up to them now in my tender middle years."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read, and I have read many books. \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" begins when Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit from the book \\"The Hobbit\\", has his 111th birthday party. At his birthday party he left the Shire and left every thing he owned to his heir Frodo Baggins; he even left the magic ring. Gandolf the wizard finds out that the ring is the evil ring-of-power that was made by the Dark Lord Sauron. Years later after Gandolf found out about Frodo's ring, Frodo leaves the Shire with three other Hobbit companions. They are pursued by the fearsome Ringwraiths and finally make it to the Elven Lord, Elronds House. Along the way Frodo and his companions find many new friends and meet many evil dangers including a confrontation with the Ringwraiths. At Elronds house, they join a group of companions whose mission is to destoy the ring at Mordor Sauron's fortress. On their journey to destroy the ring they meet many evil dangers including one Gandolf the Grey can't beat.I recommend this book to people who like action and drama. This is an excellent book so even if you don't like action or drama you should still read it -- it could be the best book you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have never been a fan of the fantasy genre. My taste has always been of the classic, 18th and 19th century literature (i.e. Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, Louisa May Alcott, Oscar Wilde and so on).I am proud to say that Tolkien has broadened my selection of stories from which I now choose to read.Tolkien has a way of bringing a scene alive like the greatest writers of all-time. While reading The Fellowship of the Ring I felt as though I were there with the Fellowship; fortunately I was not. Some may think he labors a scene with descriptions but I assure you he does not. Everything he writes is for a purpose at some point in the story. And I might add, the best stories are those that give the most background about characters and places. Nothing is worse than a flat character, except bad writing.To those who decide not to read this trilogy I say this: You are missing out on two things: first, one of the most fantastic stories told of all-time and second, on an exquisite piece of writing.Incidentally, if you do read this trilogy be sure not to miss The Hobbit and The Silmarillion. The former is what I'd call the \\"prologue\\" to the trilogy and the latter is considered the bible of Middle Earth.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"WOW! This book is just unbelievable! Took my breath away....A story that shows the virtues of friendship, love, sacrifice,....a real heartwarming story. What i really liked about this book was that the hero of this story was a small, measle character who does not know what he's in for, or how he's supposed to save the day, he relies on his friends...its very rare because nowadays &quot;heroes&quot; are muscular, handsome men who know absolutely, everything, right? Well, read this story &amp; you will be absolutely touched.Frodo, a small hobbit (humans that are generally 3'6&quot; &amp; have furry feet, read The hobbit for more), was chosen by fate to be aringbearer &amp; bring the one powerful &amp; dangerous ring that rules them all to Mordor, the only place it can really be destroyed. He faces danger &amp; obstacles every path on the road.Read this! believe me, it might take a while, but it will definitely be worth your while!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Hopefully the first film of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; will cause many viewers to read the original books. Open the books, start reading, and you'll find the real treasure.If you have seen the movie and are new to the books, be prepared for a few things to be different:1 - Tolkien has to construct his world (Middle Earth) with words. Sounds ridiculous and obvious, but Tolkien spends a LOT of time describing this world, these people, and their history. In fact, most readers new to the book will probably find more information than they wanted to know. Understand, however, that for this world to be believable, Tolkien had to dive in and create a believable world that you could sink your teeth into. There's a lot of description and it's all important. Don't get discouraged.2 - The action is not as frequent as it is in the film. Get used to that. The action comes, but Tolkien wisely leaves a lot of the detail here up to the reader's imagination. When it comes down to it, the book is really not about the action as much as it is about the characters and how they behave. You get a little of this in the film, you get a lot of it in the book. Savor it.3 - Read 'The Hobbit' first. Even if you saw the film, you need to read the &quot;introduction&quot; to the series. It's fun, not too long, and will help you understand the goings-on of Middle Earth.If you are about to undertake the journey of Middle Earth for the first time, I envy you. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the great works not only of fantasy, but of all 20th Century literature. Be patient. Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the world Tolkien made and loved. I think you'll love it too."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book, The Fellowship of the Ring, is the most amazing book I have ever read in my entire life. It is extremely well-written, and very impacting. I admit I got emotional over many scenes in the book. I was very touched by the sense of fellowship... everlasting friendship that binds people together... that Tolkien gave off through his writing. No doubt that his work influenced me to write better and be more patient at times with my own work. I cried during the death of a character, which has never happened to me before. I strongly recommend reading this book, and the rest of the trilogy... I can guarantee that you will be as touched by this amazing emotional and epic book as I am."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This story exemplifies why books are so much better than the films.So much more to read and involve yourself with.A steady beginning to the adventure that captures the imagination.

Tolkien was truly a master. I had not read The Lord of the Ring since before the epic movie production was released, but Peter Jackson's The Hobbit will be released in December and I thought it was a good time to re-read. Just finished The Hobbit and now after finishing the Fellowship I am on to The Two Towers. The best of the three is still The Return of the King. I am in my late 50's but I am prompting my grandchildren on being Tolkien Fans!If you haven't read the Hobbit and The Trilogy, please do. You will become instant Tolkien Fans too!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \\"Sword and Sorcery,\\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of \\"High Fantasy,\\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entireSilmarillionlegendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the \\"Elvish Tongues,\\" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it becameThe Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey \\"there and back again\\" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in \\"pipe-weed\\"). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of aJ.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a \\"trilogy,\\" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, \\"The First Journey\\" or \\"The Ring Sets Out\\"; Book II, \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" or \\"The Ring Goes South\\"; Book III, \\"The Treason of Isengard\\"; Book IV, \\"The Journey of the Ring-bearers\\" or \\"The Ring Goes East\\"; Book V, \\"The War of the Ring\\"; and Book VI, \\"The End of the Third Age\\".THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first publisher-created volume. It starts out much like THE HOBBIT: Bilbo Baggins throws a magnificent going-away party and sets out for parts unknown. He leaves most of what he owns behind to be inherited by his nephew Frodo, including a magic ring which has the interesting ability to make its wearer invisible. The Ring (always capitalized) also has the ability to confer apparently eternal life and youth, and this makes Gandalf, the Grey Wizard (who appeared in THE HOBBIT as well), suspicious of its provenance.Ultimately, Gandalf discovers that Frodo's Ring is indeed the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than a thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.Closely pursued by \\"The servants of Sauron\\" Frodo flees The Shire, taking the One Ring with him to the temporary haven of Rivendell, where lives Elrond the Half-Elven, a master of wisdom. After a long council, it is decided to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast.The Ring sets out in the company of a Fellowship consisting of four Hobbits, two Men, an Elf, a Dwarf, and Gandalf, but almost immediately their steps are dogged by The Enemy.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, particularly Book I, is very unlike the remainder of the trilogy. Tolkien was still clearly trying to write a sequel to THE HOBBIT, and so in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING there are some of the avuncular narrator's asides which either made THE HOBBIT so charming or so irritating to a reader, and a kind of chattiness and droll humor that is absent from the rest of the LORD OF THE RINGS, as in\\"Why are you eavesdropping?\\"\\"Beggin' your pardon, but there ain't no eaves in Bag-End, and that's a fact.\\"\\"He took along a supply of pipe-weed (but not enough, I'll warrant).\\"Tolkien also includes many of his own original poems and songs.Ironically enough, this disparate tone works spectacularly well, since it was entirely organic and not planned out. What starts out as a second journey There And Back Again transmogrifies by small increments into a classic epic tale of a Quest, drawing the reader along with it.Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, set a high standard for fantasy authors who came after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail. Thus, we are told that \\"wisps of fog, like steam, rose off the surface of the dark river,\\" and we know what the \\"muddy\\" ground is like, that a \\"sullen\\" rain fell, and even what the phase of the moon is.Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. \\"Elen sila lumenn' omentilvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting.\\" For what it is, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserves as many stars as it can get."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A new wave of readers have discovered \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.And since this is being rereleased for the 75th Anniversary edition, apparently they've cleaned out some errors and replaced certain words with more archaic ones that Tolkien preferred.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I highly recommend this Audiobook version of The Fellowship of the Ring narrated by Rob Inglis.

Rob Inglis is a great narrator, his voice is not grating, his variations of the characters & creatures voices are wonderful, and his singing is also great. I, personally, think there are no other versions of this on audiobook that can come close to comparing.

Instead, the reader will find an extraordinary amount of time dedicated to introducing us to the fictional world of Middle-earth. For the fan of fantasy books, the read will be an engulfing experience, but for the person just venturing into this literary area and who are use to more straightforward prose that moves the plot forward, it may be challenging.Many may find that they are unsure if they can continue on with the following two parts, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Return of the King&quot;. Let me reassure you that as the novel progresses you will not be disappointed. At the end of Fellowship and into the Two Towers, the book will literally hit its stride as the adventure of Frodo, Strider, and the rest of Fellowship unfolds.The entire story of The Lord of the Rings is truly a classic and one that will be enjoyed by anyone who takes the time to immerse themselves in this glorious tale."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have a friend who for years tried to get me to read the Tolkien books. She fell in love with them in the 70s when they were very popular and wanted to share them with everyone. I'm not really into narrative prose--although I occasionally read a murder mystery of the classic \\"who-done-it\\" type--so I have never read the books, Fern's efforts not withstanding. When the recent Peter Jackson film Lord of the Rings came out, I was very taken with the trailers for it and decided to see what all of the hullabaloo was about. Needless to say, like many people, I was totally taken with the color, the scenery, the characters and the adventure of the movie. I decided to read some of the books before the advent of the next film, The Two Towers, so that I could be better prepared to enjoy and appreciate it. My first venture into Tolkien's style was The Hobbit or There and Back Again, which I managed to read in a matter of a few hours.Because the film had initially sparked my interest, I read part one of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, from which the action of the movie was taken. This book is considerably more complex in style than The Hobbit, and probably represents a more mature writer. (In checking the copywrite dates, I discovered that The Hobbit was, in fact, written in the 1930s, while the Fellowship appears to have been copywrited in the 1950s shortly before the author had retired from his academic career.) It's narration is much more convoluted, with great attention given to environmental detail and more space devoted to poetry, some of it exquisite--and I don't normally like poetry--than in the earlier work, perhaps reflecting the author's intention to appeal to a more adult audience. While The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the Lord of the Rings is a more sophisticated fantasy. The bard like style, the poetical interludes, the almost Celtic character of the story, and the author-created languages reflect Tolkien's background as a linguist, philologist, and translator of Anglo-Saxon poetry. It is almost as if he is writing a history of the parallel world of elves, halflings, and dwarves that mankind believed existed around them during the early middle ages, a delightful and frightful world of magic and mystery that modern man misses for all his scientific and technological advances!An enjoyable if brief suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and the mythical, mystical world of Middle Earth in which it takes place, have enthralled millions of readers. This book, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" is the first part of that legendary saga, which tells of the discovery that the magic ring given to Frodo Baggins by his uncle Bilbo is indeed the One Ring, forged by the dark lord Saroun, which would give him unstopable distructive power if he reclaims it. Therefore, it is decided that Frodo should embark on a perilous quest to destroy the evil, corruptive ring by casting it back in the Cracks of Doom where it was originally forged - in the very center of Saroun's stronghold, the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie - resulting in the ultumate good-versus-evil struggle - one which will captivate you, shock you, thrill you, scare you, and, yes, deeply move you. This first part will leave you breathless.If it is possible to improve upon Tolkien's already perfect text, Rob Inglis has done so in this complete and unabriged audiobook performance. From the moment he begins to read the story to you, you are totally immersed in the world and the peoples - both good and evil - that inhabit it. Each character is given a distinctive voice that perfectly suits his or her personality as described by Tolkien in the novel. He shifts from character to character flawlessly, perfectly balancing them all, almost making the listener believe that the real character, not just an actor, is providing their lines. During the passages where Inglis simply acts as narrator and not as any perticular character, he proves himself the perfect person to guide the listener through Middle Earth. He embraces the diversity of the story, and uses just the right tones to set the mood for the scene and to get his audience truly involved in the groundbraking epic.This performance - like the book - is flawless, and is a true listening experience. Pick this title up; no matter if you have loved Middle Earth for a lifetime or are just a kindly newcomer seeking to immerse yourself in the exciting, perilous world, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The first part of the book shows what the Hobbits are. This partis rather too long and maybe boring. You can learn all about theHobbits though. The book becomes really enjoyable from the nextchapter. The story is very thrilling and mythical. Tolkien usesmany motifs of medieval epic, Arthurian romance, Celtic legendand Old English poems. We can entry into the old-fashionedworld of story of adventure.Also Tolkien uses many styles of English- a colloquial expressionbetween the hobbits, a bit Middle- English like dialog by theelves and kings, a daialectal talk by the hobbit Sam and others.Reading this book, you can read all kinds of speeches and evenpoems."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy are one of the finest books written. Many other fantasy books included a lot of magic, evil wizards, big wars and happy endings. The Trilogy are fantasy books that are like no others. It mainly centers on a great journey to destroy an evil, with wars and evil wizards as just additions. Even the usage of magic is rare except when it comes to the evil Rings' seduction. The evil seduction is just one of the aspects that makes this books' plot dark so you should not expect a fairytale Narnia story.Many would find these books strange, for example, Tolkien does not create the characters personalities etc. throughtout the books but only changes them yet this makes the characters more believable. The books though, are not for the weak-willed readers since you need patience and a good imagination.Tolkien does not just create a plot and a load of characters in the books, but a whole new world so the books aren't simple. Yet this makes them amazing. It's the Star Wars of fantasy fiction. Every detail that Tolkien has written draws you further into that world. This is the difference between the movie and the books: the movie doesn't draw you in. These books are not for you if you are looking for a Harry Potter, quick read kind of book the centers mainly on the plot.This is definatly one of those books that seem hard and boring to get into but then you keep reading and it gets better. We've all had one of those books so with this one you can't give up. It is the best book i have ever read and it beats the rest of the fantasy books. (And segmented into 7 books make the chapters fly.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books in The Lord of the Rings; a story set in the fictional world of Middle Earth. The Lord of the Rings is Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that holds much of his power. His really wants his ring back and is controls some of the inhabitants Middle Earth. Through unknown ways, the ring is given to Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. Because of the ring, however, Frodo is caught up in business that will change Middle Earth forever.With Gandalf advice, Frodo sets out with three of his hobbit friends to keep the ring out of Sauron's hands. Lord Sauron's minions attack them, but, with the help of a man named Strider, they make it safely to Rivendell, a home of elves. There, with the help of Elrond, Frodo takes the task of taking the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the pits of hell in the fiery mountain Orodruin, inside Sauron's realm of Mordor. A Fellowship is created to help him, consisting of Frodo, his servant Sam, two other hobbits, Strider, Gandalf, an elf named Legolas, a dwarf named Gemini, and a man from the south named Boromir.The Fellowship heads south and tries to pass under the Misty Mountains through Moria, the ancient realm of the dwarves. There, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dum while protecting the party from a terrible demon called a Balrog. The rest of the party continues on to Lorien, the forest of the Galadrim elves, where the Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. From there, they go down the Anduin River by boat. When they must return to land, they cannot decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the sanctuary of Minas Tirith on the west. Boromir wants the ring and confronts Frodo, who decides that he must go to Mordor. However, Frodo cannot bear to take his friends with him or to subject them to further temptation, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. He does not, however, manage to escape his faithful friend Sam, so they set out together for the realm of the Dark Lord.I really liked this book it was good easy reading. I am a complete Fantasy guy so I loved that and it has a great plot. I really like Strider a lot but Lord Sauron is the coolest by far."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is the grim lesson learned by many who have sought the One Ring Of Power, a relic with powers of astonishing magnitude. Anyone who has ever possessed it has succumbed to its power... Except one. Frodo Baggins is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit. The ring that Bilbo found in that story is the One Ring, which was thought to be lost for centuries. Frodo is asked by Gandalf the Wizard to deliver the Ring to the town of Rivendell so that a council can decide how to destroy it before its maker Sauron revives himself and reclaims the Ring, then destroys the world. At the council, no one can agree on who should be the \\"Ring-Bearer\\" and bring the Ring to Mordor so that it can be destroyed. Along with Frodo go eight others, who are dubbed the Fellowship of the Ring. This includes Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn and Boromir, the humans, Legolas, the elf, Gimli, the dwarf, and the hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. But this is no easy task. Ringwraiths, trapped spirits forced to serve Sauron, are relentlessly searching for the Fellowship. What's more, Saruman (not to be confused with Sauron), a former ally, has become corrupt and obssesses over the Ring, and wants its power for himself. This is a great book, so if you haven't read it, at least check it out. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book was awesome!!! It was full of adventure and excitement. I can not wait to finish the trilogy. If I were Frodo, I would have let someone else continue my journey when they reached the House of Elrond. I do not know how he kept up the courage to keep running from the frightening Black Riders of Sauron. I could not wait to turn the page to find out what was going to happen next. There is a lot of anticipation as the journey progresses. No sooner do you think that the fellowship is in the clear that they are on the run again from the Black Riders and Sauron. This is a must read book, even if you saw the movie. Having seen the movie, it interested me even more to read the book and finish the trilogy to see the next two movies. If you can help it, read the book before you go see the movie.

I would order from these guys again in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is my least favorite of the three books as its split up into two separate books/stories. The first one is entertaining, it tells the story of the people Rohan going to Helm's Deep and their fight against Saruman as well as the Ents battle against Saruman. This part has a lot of history thrown around and it has the exciting battle sequences of Helms Deep and the battle at Isengard. This is all good and enjoyable to read.The second part is the tale of Frodo and Sam and their eventual companion Gollum as they traverse the wasted lands north of Mordor and finally into Mordor, where the story stops. There is not much going on here, and there isn't a lot of history thrown around, this is just character building for Frodo and Sam and the quest. Also the story ends abruptly, without a satisfying conclusion, in my opinion.Still overall the book is a classic, and I liked it. This is at least the tenth time I've read/heard this story in the past 25 years, so it still always gets a run every few years. The audio version I listened to sounded very professional. I also think after hearing this audio book and listening to the orc voices I believe Peter Jackson listened to this well to come up with some of the orc voices in his movies."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"this book is such a thrilling book it was hard for me to put it down. all the characters are so real but not at the same time !!!! it was also a very well writen book. tolken is such a good author. i encourage you to read the other books also they are wonderful books to."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"When I was 9 I watched the third movie with my dad, and loved it.

I wanted to read the books, my dad never did before he saw the movie, but he has seen all three movies! while I had no clue what happened in the first and second movie, (although now I have seen the end of the second one,) I soon forgot all about it. We got cable, and two years after my dad found the third movie on some channel. I watched all of it, I had to be forced to eat my supper and take my eyes off the screen, I couldn't take it any more. When I was 12 I got the first book from the library, since my dad wouldn't takeme to the book store, I finished it withen two weeks. It was amazing, every word was perfect, and I understood most of it. My dad is waiting until we buy it before he reads it. I love the story, it all comes together, and is all connected.

Have fun."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is the finest piece of writing that I have ever read. The Fellowship of the Ring though it is a rather old book, it still is very good. The Author starts out by telling about the events of what happened in the book The Hobbit and then goes on to tell about the events that currently are happening in Hobbiton, which is where the majority of hobbits in the story live and are from. Without giving away too much, the story then takes a turn for the worst, and the hero of the story, Bilbo Baggins, Must take the ring of power once held by Sauron, where is must be destroyed. The bulk of the first book in the series is about the journey to rivendell, which is where the elves are located, and then they must get south to the area close to Rohan and Gondor, the humans civilizations in the story. The book in my opinion is a good book because the characters are all developed very well, and they all have a back-story behind them, and they all have something to tell and for the most part seems blank in the story. The author is very descriptive in his writing, and likes to share a lot of details with the reader that would normally be left out of other books because of time restraints, or other reasons that need not be discussed. The basic factor behind this book is that the author is so good that the book works around the few problems that it has, and works through them with tremendous steam driving force. The problems that the book mostly experiences are that, the author sometimes goes too in depth with detail, and he sometimes drags on and on with certain parts. Some may find this very interesting, but from where I stand it goes on too long some times, and doesn't really progress to anything of real importance that may be used by the reader. But some believe that when the author goes into this extreme depth that he gets a point across, he sometimes does this but other times the detail just goes on and on without getting anywhere. The major strong points of this movie are that the characters are given real depth and they know what their doing based on what that type of character would normally decide in that situation, and not what the author would decide if He was there in that condition, and based on this the book accomplishes the factor that those characters have a very humanistic quality to them, and they always know where they are going based on their conditions. The characters though there are many of them, all have a very unique quality that they share with one another and themselves that they always want to accomplish a certain goal for the group and themselves. For example the character Boromir in the story is from the nation of Gondor, he comes with the Fellowship in about the middle of the story, when the fellowship is first formed. He comes to accomplish his own goals with the ring; he wishes to use the ring for good and not to destroy it, without giving too much away this will eventually bring about the end of him, because of his greed for the ring, which shows real humanistic quality and how someone would genuinely react to this sort of instance that may occur for them. Overall I would say that this book is a genuinely the best that I've read, for the most part it overcomes the obstacles and passes through the trenches to become an award-winning book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"When I first started this book I thought it to be another boring fantasy adventure book, then Frodo left Hobbiton and from there-on-out I was compleatly hooked.

The characters are well described and played out throught the book. Their journey starts in the Shire where we meet Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Grey comes to Bilbo's 111th birthday party and Bilbo shares plans to leave the Shire to adventure again after his party is near over. Gandalf sees a change in his life long friend from the last time that he saw him. Bilbo mentions of a ring that he found on his last adventure that he took and also mentions that when he has the ring with him he doesnt feel a year older. When Gandalf trys to convince Bilbo to leave the ring behind when he leaves, Bilbo goes crazy. Gandalf finally convinces Bilbo that it is best to leave the ring to Frodo when he leaves. Frodo doesnt know how powerful the ring is until he is instructed to leave the Shire because it is not safe with him there. He travels with 3 other friends (who are all hobbits like him) to Bree to find the Prancing Pony Inn. There they meet Strider who is a trusted friend of Gandalf and protects the boys through the night from the Ring Wraiths. The Next day the party of five now leaves for Rivendell to reunite with Gandalf. On the way during one night the group is attacked by the Ring Wraiths and Frodo is injured by one. Arwen (the daughter of Elrond) is trusted by Strider to take Frodo ahead of the group to Rivendell because Frodo needs Elrond's treatment to stop his transformation into a Ring Wraith. Frodo arrives savely and recieves treatment, then soon learns of why he was attacked specifically. The Council of Elrond, which consists of a representitive of the nine areas of Middle Earth(with the exception of Mordor). Together they decide to have Frodo take the ring to Mordor to destroy it in the place where it was created. Now the Fellowship consisting of nine members, four hobbits, two warriors, an elf, a dwarf and a wizard, set out on their incredible journey across Middle Earth to take back the one ring of power. Through The Misty Mountains and the underlying caves, the Fellowship embarks on a journey that faces them against such foes as: Orcs, A Giant Octupuss, Ring Wraiths and a Balrog. Though the party loses Gandalf to the Balrog, the Fellowship pushes on toward their goal of Mordor. Facing many other challenges and triumphs."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book really comes alive in the first chapters. The action may be a little bit slow in the beginning, but the wonderful details and descriptions of every part of the world really make this story seem real. As the story progresses, new locales are visited by the companions, and new challenges are conquered. From the start of this book, with Bilbo leaving the Shire, and giving everything he has to his nephew, Frodo. Gandalf the wizard then tells him that a ring bilbo left to him is really Sauron's One Ring of Power, and if he recovers it, it spells doom for all races of Middle-earth. Thus Frodo, with the help of three of his friends, makes it to the house of Elrond, where he seeks further council, and then heads off to Mount Doom with 8 other companions to destroy the ring and defeat the Dark Lord. This was an exceptional book"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tolkien created this unique world where men, hobbits, elves, ogres, et al all mix & mingle with one another. By reading this special piece, I journeyed to the middle earth & experienced the quest of the \\"Company\\" to battle evil.Quite interesting with Tolkien's unique language for each specie & the numerous 'songs' (supposedly) sang by the elves. Not to mention the very helpful map included at the start of the book which guided me through my reading. Very descriptive --- even the unimaginative cannot help but picture Tolkien's world vividly.I started with the Hobbit & moved on to this & immediately continued to read Books 2 & 3. Well, I have to admit, I had an overload of the Hobbit world but I appreciated the entire story more, since I view it as just one long continuing saga of the Company's mission to save Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is a great book but you have to be ready for the difficulties of reading it. It is hard to get into the language and fully understanding it. Sometimes you will have to read the same sentence over and over to finally get the meaning. I love the characters and as the book goes on it is easier to read. I can almost put myself in middle earth and feel like I am there with Frodo and everyone else. Just don't over analyse the language and try to remember everything that goes on, that would make reading this book like a headache.

Little does he know, that this ring can rule and destroy all of Middle-Earth. He and a Fellowship of nine must destroy this ring, or Middle-Earth will perish. Together, they seek Mt. Doom, the only force that can destroy the ring. They face many perils. In the end, for the most part, they succeed.This book was very exciting, I enjoyed it. It was Full of action and adventure. This Fellowship of Nine faced many dark creatures, and with the help of Gandalf, the strongest in their party, were victorious. Many demonic creatures are after them, they want to help their master, Sauron, get the ring. With this ring, Sauron can control all of Middle-Earth, but these nine devoted people will go to any lengths to make sure this doesn't happen. This book kept me on the edge of my seat.My favorite part of the book is when they had to pass through the Mines of Moria, a dark, dreadful place full of goblins and a firey demon. Gimli, the dwarf, helps Gandalf navigate through the dark mines. These mines were once inhabited by dwarves, and Gimli used to live in them. During the end, the Fellowship is attacked by Goblins. They fight them the best they can. They flee towards the exit when something bigger and more evil attacks them. A large, fiery, demon seeks to destroy them and get the ring to Sauron.

Frodo Baggins is given the responsibility of destroying the One Ring, the ring that will give the evil Sauron the power to destroy all of Middle Earth. He leaves to the Cracks of Doom with nine companions, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. The Felllowsip is being pursued by the evil Ringwraiths, servents of Sauron. With the orcs and other evil creatures of Sauron at their trail, the weight of the ring on Frodo is terrible. As the Ringwraiths grow near, the desire to put on the ring is tremedous, and that is the one thing that will bring them nearer.

I can't wait to get into the other books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The entire Lord of The Ring trilogy, starting here, is that rare thing so often mentioned in literature but so rarely true -- the undisputed masterpiece. This book shows that Tolkien's imagination must have been truly boundless. It starts the trilogy by recounting the events of The Hobbit, adding and greatly enrichening them, and weaving them into the tale of the Ring. It then goes on to tell of the Fellowship and sets the characters off on their journey. The book is so epic, so wide in scope that readers come away feeling that they have just read a true account, an actual happening from an actual world; such is the book's power. Tolkien has really described the whole world of Middle-Earth and its people in such striking and vivid detail that one can only be in awe. Apart from the striking array of richly drawn characters, a marvel in itself, Tolkien has created languages and entire histories for his characters, Hobbits of course being gone into in particular depth. This is a tale so epic, so novel, so bold that you are bound to like it regardless of your literary conventions. Tolkien's writing is very smooth -- though archaic seeming and a lot different from what we now see, which of course only adds to the marvel and sense of wonder -- and very poetic at times. It almost feels like reading poetry. There are of course lots of actual songs also. Not that the book is perfect. It is a bit overlong, and some parts drag. The walking bits seem particularly slow, as does The Council of Elrond, necessary though it is. There are also too many songs for my taste, ingenious though they are. Still, few books come closer to mastery. This is one of the books that all should be able to say they've read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is about the journey of Frodo and his companions. Frodo is a hobbit who lives in the Shire with his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. On the day that the book starts, it is Frodo's and Bilbo's birthday and Bilbo celebrates with a grand party with presents for all. In the middle of the party Bilbo vanishes and leaves a ring for Frodo. This ring is the beginning of his journey and the end of his normal life. Frodo learns of the power of the ring and of the dark forces of Sauron, who wish to steal the ring and slay its bearer. Frodo begins his journey with his companion Sam Gamgee. In the rest of the book, they acquire more alliances and companions to aid them in their quest to destroy the ring and save middle earth, and this is known as The Fellowship of the Ring.This book is recommended because of the suspense of Frodo's journey and the story behind it. There are many good chapters in the book, and it will rarely leave readers with a boring moment. Readers may wish that the book had is a bit more detail on the story behind the Ring Wraiths of Mordor. The book is a bit hard to understand if read through too fast because of the old style speech that some of the characters use. In some chapters, readers must really pay attention, such as The Council of Elrond, because of the detail Tolkien goes into and what will become of the ring. If one likes fantasy books with elves, orcs, goblins and wizards, read this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This trilogy has to be one of the greatest epic ever written.

Lord of the Rings is a story set in a fake place called the middle earth, the middle earth is where bag-end is. Like Thomasville is in the United States. The actual Lord of the Rings is Sauron, the Dark Lord, who lost the One Ring that had most of his strength. He wants to get the ring back and make all the people in the middle earth slaves. In a very strange turn of events, the ring somehow ended up in the little hands of Frodo Baggins, who is a simple hobbit. Hobbits are little tiny people who are about half the size of normal people. They have big hairy feet and they are short and stout. Frodo is the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins. But somehow the fate of the entire middle earth rests in Frodo Baggins hands. With Gandalf, the powerful wizard as their leader, Frodo and three of his friends, Sam Gamgee, Pippin Took,and Merry Brandybuck set out to keep the ring from Saurons hands but destroying the ring by taking it to the cracks of doom, the only place that it can be destroyed.

It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.I would also like to say the people that rate on what the book looks like are rating for the wrong reason, because i saw i guy saying it was one of the best books he has ever read but he gave it on star because how it looks. Frodo is a better character than Bilbo was in the hobbit.Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.This is the best book Tolkien has ever written.This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am just 12 and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece.

Tolkein gives the different races a certain attitude and the individual characters have personalitys that meet those attitudes. You know the dwarves are physically strong and carry pride, the elves are secret and cunning, the hobbits are hasty and curious, and many other things without Tolkein coming out and directly saying it. He is able to describe the scenary and the situation extremely well, I feel like I'm really in a land to where the grass is fresh and green, the air is refreshing and easy to breath, and the atmoshphere is happy when he explains the Shire. Yet on the other hand he can make me feel fear by explaining the fright that the characters are experiencing.

Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing.

Hobbits are little people that are cheerful and shy. The main character in this book is a hobbit named Frodo who must go on a perilous adventure. This book also contained a lot of sensory language. The Fellowship of the Ring also had many surprise outcomes or endings. If you try to guess what will happen next you are usually wrong.If you are interested in reading this book I sugest first reading The Hobbit, which contains an equally exciting adventure and will help explain many parts of The Fellowship of the Ring.Another interesting thing is that there is a movie coming out of The Fellowship of the Ring and this may be another incentive for reading it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I and many others will tell those of you who haven't read LOTR that if you were to read only one of the books, read this one.

Now that I am reading the Lord Of The Rings series, I knew why I thought that this is boring.It is because I was a little kid and didn't understand it very well. What I am saying is that I think that this should be a book for kids that are in middle school or higher because it has easy understanding but you have to concentrate more on this book than other books (for me at least).I am not saying that little kids shouldn't read this, but I am recommending it to an older audience because it is a little more complex than other books.

It was a great decision to do so. Even though the movie was a spectacular display of making an imaginary world come alive, it was not nearly as enthralling as this simply incredible book. I was just amazed with how much information and how many details were given about middle-earth and the characters within. Whenever I was reading this book my mind left my body and went to Tolkien's amazingly enchanted world.With J.R.R. Tolkien's fluid diction and incredible use of imagery, this book is a page-turner that will keep one up way into the middle of the night. If there is a problem with this book (and movie) it is the fact that it does not end, at least yet. In order to figure out the ending one must read the next two books in the series: &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Return of the King.&quot; I have not read either one of these, but I think I will continue with my pace of seeing the movie and then reading the book nine months later. I would also recommend this method to anyone who has not seen or read any of &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; books or movies because seeing the movie first helps put faces with names while reading the book. No matter what method one uses to read these enchanting fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, I recommend that they are read with an open mind and a will to be enthralled.

If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books. I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again. I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed. The movie is good, but it is different from the novel. Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading. As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out. Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.This novel opens my imagination. That is why I love Tolkien's work. It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder. I can feel myself in the journey. Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen. I am there. The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination. The nights before entering Moria. The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels.

Now some have criticized the language and I can see where that would throw some people off, however if you just let it flow over you it can really get insense.

It doesn't take a lot to see the parallels between Goodkind and Jordan's first novels and Tolkiens, the exhausting flight in the face of deadly and unexpected danger, the reluctant hero and even the black riders in the case of Jordan. So compelling and complete is Tolkien's dominance of this genre that it will take another genius of his calibre to truly innovate in every respect. With the film's of the same name fothcoming over the next three years I would recommend everyone get a copy a read or re-read what has to rank as one of the greatest works of literature produced in the last century to see if Peter Jackson can truly bring to life the majesty of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I &amp; II, Lost Tales (all volumes)).

He takes a genre once associated only with acne-faced teenage boys and elevates it to literary excellence. His selection as Writer of the Century was well-deserved to say the least.Written mostly during Europe's WWII years, the symbolism of that war lies heavily in his novels (See especially &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter in Vol. 3 &quot;The Return of the King&quot;)His epic story has a background color and richness that rarely exists in today's literary works. He built his own languages from the syllables on up, his appendices and notes lend depth and history to his works, he is truly the only fantasy write to literally create a world. Every sentence that spills from the mouths of his characters hints at a world that we are only scratching the surface of.The poetry and lore that his characters express hint at the many volumes that Tolkien could have written if time would have allowed it. Rarely have I seen a fantasy writer who could put such a large amount of high quality verse and rhyme into their works.Almost every fantasy author of the last 30 years must tip their hat in Tolkien's direction. I have yet to find a noteable fantasy author who didn't mention Tolkien in their list of inspiring/influencing authors.I can only hope that on the eve of the long awaited Lord of the Rings movies that would-be Tolkien Cinema fans take the time to read the epic fantasy saga that made the movies possible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

This book cannot be classified as fantasy, epic or anything because it truly stands alone. I was a bit suprised to see it only got 4 1/2 stars, but then I read the reviews. I can understand the frustration of the half dozen people who gave it one star. By their own admission, most are under eighteen and were perhaps forced to read it. I also put this book down as boring when I was in high school because it was like taking a valium; it put me to sleep. I picked it up again when I was about 28 and could not believe how good it was. It is undoubtedly one of the great English language works ever created. Over the next ten years I re-read my copy of the trilogy so many times it literally fell apart. My wife gave me a deluxe edition a few years ago and I once again cruised through it this summer. I don't attempt to read it word for word but simply dwell in Middle Earth for a while. I am now 41 and appreciate it more than ever. So if you are having trouble with it now, wait a few years and try again. You may eventually catch up to it.

The fellowship of the ring is from the beginning to the end a linguistic maze; those who have troubles with beautiful; almost poetic, language; will not appreciate this, but set aside that; and look only at the contains of this work, and you'll realize what a brilliant mind Tolkien had, noticeably is that he took much inspiration from Nordic, Preussic and Greek mythology; which adds to the atmosphere and feeling of this book, everything feels real; authentic, as if it was written in experience, I've read David Eddings, I've read Elizabeth Moon, but they are just mere pale copies compared to J.R.R Tolkien, (not saying they're bad though, just emphasizing on how great Tolkien is). This is a book that really is best experienced alone, in a dark room, with some soft moody music and just enough light to read, be terrified, be amazed, be astounded.To those who have yet to read this, and these books: I am in envy, the first experience of them is incredible, just put a little effort into it, and you will be rewarded times 1000."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Zachary PayneSeptember 29, 2004Mrs. Paulson, LAThe Fellowship of the RingThe story of the Quest for the One Ring, a small creature (a child in our eyes) stumbles upon the Ring. It gives him long life and youth, but it also eats away at his mind. When Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew he also gives him a quest that takes him across Middle Earth, meeting strange folk and fighting fierce battles, where Frodo witnesses true loyalty.This is a red-letter book with a plot that runs as thick as it's spine. I would also recommend The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The author, J.R.R.

The width is perfect; the font size and spacing are relieving to the eye, light and spacious, enough room to break up the printing so it doesn't jumble together on long, extended reading marathons, which with Tolkien is easy to do.This is, of course, the first part of the new \\"Holy Trilogy.\\" I would strongly recommend starting with the books if you've never forayed into Tolkien's Middle Earth before, although it's hard to find someone who hasn't seen Jackson's films. Needless to say, the film has done some \\"light\\" editing, such as many of the songs, as well as the Anglo-Saxon influence, which makes it in the film as dress, props, and the honorable Boromir.Chronologically the book follows a larger timescale than the films. For example, Gandalf leaves for the archives at Minas Tirith immediately after Bilbo leaves the Shire, and seems to be gone for only a week or so. In the book, his absence is actually three years in length, then a brief visit, and then another nine years. Although this all takes place in less than a page-length, the impression it leaves is that time has surely passed by, and Frodo is not quite the same hobbit as before. There has also been some shifting of the dialogue in the films. Example; the line \\"I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear\\" comes in the film at the Council of Elrond scene. In this book, it comes in Chapter two.Also cut are the smatterings of Old English, such as the word \\"glede\\" which is \\"hot coal\\" (haven't translated in years). As for the story itself; modern mythology, legendary, enchanting, superb. Yes, all these things.Finally, the maps in back are the authentic ones by Tolkien himself. They are printed large enough to trace your own pen-marks on them and make notes in the margins, useful especially if you're teaching.The quality of materials is good as well; you can beat these editions up a fair amount, dog-ear the pages, and they'll hold. The binding is very well done as well, no breaking or falling apart."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings/ The Hobbit are one of the best series of books ever written. What is so vast about Tolkien is that he creates a world and a culture like nobody else. He created languages, mythology, huge maps, etc.., culture, and in this world which is as believable as ours, a huge war is on the verge is breaking out. Many will complain that it is boring or pays too much attention to details, but do not listen...Warning: if you get stuck on the chapter \\"The Council of Elrond\\", know that after that chapter it gets very interesting, and you can skip a few pages if you like. Also, the movie-lovers will proclaim that this is not anywhere as good as the movie. Some will tell you that the book does an injustice to the movie. But do not listen to them.

The world created has clear cut lines between good and evil, leaving us whole-heartedly cheering on Frodo and the Fellowship. However, not only does Tolkien's Middle Earth capture us, we also are taken by Frodo's brave journey. He possesses the One Ring, which if surrendered to the enemy could destroy all that is good in Middle Earth. Frodo is faithfully accompanied by his innocent and vulnerable friends Sam, Pippin and Merry. Their helplessness and doomed quest capture the readers' attention and encourage the reader to complete all three parts Tolkien's spectacular trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the excellent first installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a story of Middle-Earth, where Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and all sorts of other races live. Set in a medieval-type setting, with medieval weapons and archetecture while combining fantasy and magic with realistic things. Though this book starts off a little slow, like a marble down an inclined plane it gains momentum til it reaches the suspenseful conclusion (to be continued in The Two Towers).Frodo Baggins (a Hobbit), relative of Bilbo Baggins who found the One Ring and took it from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, inherits the Ring from Bilbo. He soon learns that it is a corrupting Ring, the One Ring into which Sauron the Dark Lord poured all his wrath and malice in to. Gandalf the Wizard advises him to 'keep it secret, keep it safe' until he returns. He returns to tell Frodo that the what the One Ring really meant and that it must be thrown into the Cracks of Doom, the one place where it could be destroyed. This happened to be in the middle of the evil kingdom of Mordor where Sauron was regaining power, searching for the Ring, and preparing to destroy all that was good. Frodo, along with Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Sam, journeys to Bree where they meet Aragorn the Ranger and eventually reach Rivendell, all the while pursued by the Ringwraiths. There in Rivendell, the Fellowship that would take the Ring to Mordor to be destroyed was formed: Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Wizard, Boromir of Gondor, and Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam. They then embark on there quest: through Moria and Lorien, and many other places wonderful and terrible. Will they ever finish their quest?J.R.R. Tolkien weaves a masterful tale in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, to be continued by &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. His style of writing, plus the constant surprises and happenings, make this a wonderful story, a timeless classic for generations to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I believe that Lord of the Rings part one deserved 4.5 stars(out of five). It started off slow, but it leaves you wanting more. If you liked the Hobbit, this book is a must read. If you have not read the Hobbit, and you are planning on reading the Fellowship, I recomend reading the hobbit first so that you can see what the ring appears to be, and get an idea of what the main characters are like. But if your even going start to read it, you should at least be a little bit interested in fantasy types of books. And if you are even thinking about it being like Harry Potter, Ill tell you now, its not(its better).The main characters are frodo(A hobbit), Gandalf(A wizard), Aragorn/Strider(A king and a ranger),Sam(A hobbit),Merry and Pippin(Also hobbits), Legolas(An elf),Gimli(A dwarf),and Borimir (A king of men). These individuals were banded together in Rivindel to make the Fellowship of the ring. Thier mission was to destroy the one ring. Why destroy it?Well,the Dark Lord Sauron forged a ring that he invested all his powers into wich made him powerful enough to destroy Middle Earth. But only was it powerfull when he wore it. It was in the last attempt to fight against the armies of Sauron that Isuldir the king at that time, cut the ring from Saurons hand and took it for himself. Although the ring when in possetion of someone other than Sauron had a way of persuading the barer to wear it,for when they put it on it reveals to Sauron were the ring is. Isildir was ambushed and the ring was lost at the bottom of a lake for thousands of years until a creature named gollum or smeagol found it and hid far under the mountains under its influence. It wasnt untill Bilbo Bagins found the ring and brought it back to the shire(His home),that the ring was in good hands. Although the ring can only be destroyed in the fires of MT. Doom were it was forged, and is also were the armies and the stronghold of Sauron lay. Therefore the book is about the struggle to destroy the one ring and what the Fellowship has to do to get the ring to MT. Doom. Many battles will be fauhgt to rid the world of something so small.So if that plot doesnt interest you, I dont know what will. So I encourage you all to read The Fellowship of the Ring and all its sequals."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I'm sure much has been written about the Lord of The Rings series but basically, get through the first 100 pages or so and you'll get caught in the most masterful fantasy saga written to this day!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I am writing this critique as an English project, but also as an active reader.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is J.R.R. Tolkien's gift to the world. Tolkien did not just write a book, he created his own world full of different people, places, cultures, creatures, legends, and languages. The land of Middle-Earth is a place that he describes so vividly that you can just envision yourself there. The way he builds each of his characters' personalities, you feel an amazing amount of empathy towards them... Its almost as though you are right there with Frodo and Sam eating mushrooms, or fighting the evil Uruk-hai with Legolas and Aragorn.In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, we follow a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins on his path to save the world. You see, young Frodo inherits a ring of power that was created by a dark lord named Sauron. This ring has incredible amounts of power that Sauron wants to use to take over the world. Frodo, along with his hobbit buddies, a powerful wizard named Gandalf, an elf called Legolas, the dangerous human Aragorn, who is heir to the throne of Gondor, a dwarf who calls himself Gimli, and another human called Boromir, are on a path to destroy it. The ring that they are on this fateful quest to dispose of has a mind of its own. It wants to return to Sauron, and will manipulate the minds of its beholders until it gets there. Ridding the world of the ring is not an easy task. The ring can only be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was created, and Mount Doom is in the center of Sauron's fiery kingdom. This book is part one in a trilogy.I gave this book five stars, because its one of those you just can't help but enjoy.

At the end it is a nice story but I don't know if the pain reading it amounted to the pleasure of finishing it afterwards."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I've given a lot of good reviews on Amazon--generally, I don't review books I don't like because I don't finish them--but The Fellowship of the Ring is the absolute crown jewel of fantasy novels. In Tolkien's original plan, this was merely the first part of a single, enormous book: The Lord of the Rings. The afore-mentioned superlative could apply to the entire series, but being quite large enough on its own without the added weight of its successors, Fellowship is the all-time classic.I feel sorry for anyone who saw the movie before reading this book. I have two reasons for this: firstly, all those moviegoers, even if they read the book now, will be tempted to superimpose imagery from the film in their brains as they read, cancelling out the imaginative power of Tolkien himself. Secondly, these newer readers will be unprepared for Chapters 3-8, which are comprised entirely of matter omitted from the movie. Such readers are likely to find the story slow-starting, or even boring.Tolkien spends a lot of time working up his hobbit characters, establishing their peaceful and essentially inconsequential existence in a larger world. Only Gandalf the wizard seems to care for them at all ... until it becomes clear that one special hobbit has come into possession of an especially dangerous and powerful artifact, the Dark Lord's omnipotent ring, within which he has invested his hold on life and the potential to enslave the world.In Book I of The Fellowship, we travel with Frodo and his three hobbit companions into exile, \\"from danger towards danger, drawing it after me.\\" In Book II (the one from which the movie was largely drawn), representatives from the societies of men, elves, and dwarves accompany these hobbits at the start of an impossible mission towards the fabled Mount Doom, where alone the ring may be destroyed.Tolkien takes his time in his prose, establishing every character and setting with such talent and such a love for the language, that those of us who loves these things will be instantly and forever enchanted. Impatient readers, however, are likely to become quickly bored--and that is too bad, because the payoffs in the action scenes are worth the price of the book unto themselves.It's the best--period.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy \\"Teeth\\".)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I choose to read the classic J. R. R. Tolkien book Lord of the Rings, specifically the Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of the now famous trilogy. I choose to read it because I am a fan of both movies and have heard from several people that it is an outstanding book. I would have to say that I agree with these assessments, though I feel it was a little long winded at times.The story is entertaining, at time engaging, and the most wonderful aspect of the entire book is that Tolken masterfully creates a world of fantasy that becomes alive in the readers mind. If you really try, you can imagine a Middle Earth consisting of Dwarfs, Elves, and Hobbits fighting for the survival of the human race. Tolken takes so much care in depicting the ordinary lifestyle of hobbits that it almost makes their life seem interesting when really it is boring. However, it is brought to life with astounding detail to their habits and makes it very easy for the reader to imagine knowing a hobbit.One thing that must be made clear is that there is a world of difference between the movie and the book. Though the movie moves at a thunderous pace the book opts to be more cautious and deliberate as the tale unfolds. Of course Tolken had an entire book to work with while the movie has only three hours to unfold one of the premier science fiction stories of all time. The movie also leaves out important details about the story such as the time which passes when Frodo seizes control of Bag Ends, and the departure of Bilbo. In the movie it seems as though very little time elapses between these events however in the book it explains that no less than nine years passes before Gandalf comes to Frodo with news of the ring.Also there are several chapters in the middle of the book which tell of the hobbits journey from the Shire to the rendezvous with Gandalf. Important characters are introduced and bonds are strengthened and it seems like a relevant part of the story to me, which should not have been completely overlooked in the movie.The story is simply unique in its ability to capture the imagination of readers from many age groups. Though younger teens may have difficulty understanding more of the abstract aspects of the story the action and adventure of the story will surely keep them interested and older readers appreciate the shear genius of the story as they watch the carefully crafted tale unfold in three dazzling installments.Though I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the book more than the movie (I am of the MTV generation after all), I can truly say that the book was enjoyable to read. It has interesting underlining themes I believe about racism and judging people and the ability of people of all size and stature to achieve in the most outlandish of tasks. If you need a little inspiration or you feel that you just don't measure up to the task at hand, just look at Frodo Baggins, the small hobbit who had to save the entire world from doom. It will definitely make you feel just a little bigger, and perhaps push you to achieve your goal.The Fellowship of the Ring is a classic, and all classics deserve to be read. So if you are looking for a good book to read be sure to keep the Lord of the Rings as an option because books of it's quality are rare, and if you are a fan of the movie ( which has broken into the top ten grossing films of all times) it will help you garner a new appreciation for the story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Call me a heretic if you will, but while I found _The Fellowship of the Rings_ to be an incredibly vivid and imaginative tale, I also found that in many places, it dragged. Tolkein was a genius, no doubt about that; however, he was also a bit obsessed with an insane number of details about the world he created. Naturally, this is partly why so many people love his books immensely, but for those of us who are more interested in advancing the story than in the lineage of a hobbit or elf, the intricate details can truly weigh the book down quite a lot. On the other hand, the details in the scene-setting are wonderful - it's probably more a case of \\"one woman's drek is another's dream\\" and so forth. I reckon there's more than one person out there who hates the lavish settings, but loves the history and storytelling-through-song.As a linguist, Tolkein definitely got the language details *right* throughout this series - his efforts there are extraordinary. And, while some people no doubt find the frequent songs in the book charming and entertaining, I generally found myself clenching my teeth to get through them. Further, characters like Tom Bombadil had really interesting elements, but most of them were buried in his too-merry flouncing and bopping about. I would have loved to have seen more discussion of his relationship with nature, and less of the \\"hey-ho, Bombadillo!\\"Overall, though, this is the kind of story that parents should read to their children, letting them get swept away in the vast realm of Middle Earth. Fan of fantasy will likely also enjoy seeing where many of the standards of the genre came from. While there are parts of it went really slowly for me, it was worth the time spent.Now, for the inevitable comparison between the book and the film, for those who have experienced one but not the other. Personally, and I could easily be hunted down and thrashed for this...I enjoyed the movie more. It eliminated many of the slower areas of the tale that I didn't enjoy, yet still remained largely true to the story. Many of my die-hard Tolkein-loving friends agree that the movie did an excellent job, and that secretly, some of them enjoyed it better, too.Still, it would be worth picking up a copy of the book to see if you'd really enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole, when it was written, founded a new genre in the world of Literature. It did not &quot;set influence&quot; the concept of fantasy writing, it INVENTED the concept. These books are timeless and are rightfully placed in the ranks of books such as Candide, The Republic, Paradise Lost, and other truly classic literature. The levels of meaning range from the literal to the esoteric. While the new movies may be spuring new interest in Middle Earth, one must recall that Bilbo has lived for almost a century despite a previous movie that was disgraceful. To read The Fellowship of the Ring simply as an introduction to ann upcoming movie is a disservice both to the reader and the movie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I came to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" straight after reading \\"The Hobbit,\\" which is one of my favorite books of all times. (I've read it about ten times). Although \\"The Fellowship\\" picks up, in a sense, where \\"The Hobbit\\" left off, the two books are quite different, and the difference for me was a bit of a culture shock--enough in the past to prompt me to quit reading about after fifty pages. But this time I persevered, and did not regret it!The culture shock: totally different pace. \\"The Hobbit\\" flies along, wastes no time, goes into less detail, and covers huge distances of time and geography in a few pages. \\"The Fellowship\\" goes about ten times slower, poring over detail, which, once I got used to it, became rather interesting and at times welcomed. (I admit, though, at times I did some skimming, especially when I sensed that Tolkien was revving himself up to create his own Hobbitish version of Norse mythology.)That said, the book, overall, is excellent (so much so that I'm presently three-fourths of the way through \\"The Two Towers\\"). It's a true adventure story, spirited, passionate, deep, and for me inspiring. (I'm soon embarking on a major life adventure, and have found myself surprised to find comfort from Tolkien.) I heartily recommend it to everyone and anyone, especially if you like \\"The Hobbit.\\"But here are my criticisms, though take them with a grain of salt, because again, I find \\"The Fellowship\\" excellent overall.1) Too many poems and songs! Boring! AAH, I started skipping them after about page fifty, with NO regrets at all. Tolkien gets a little poem-and-song happy for my taste.2) The whole scene with Tom Bombadil is pointless and boring--and too grandiose for my taste. Worth skipping over entirely, because not only does it detour from the tale, but actually detracts from it. Why did Tolkien put that in?3) Tolkien makes some silly and/or inconsistent plot decisions from the get-go. To give one of many possible examples, Strider's whole mission is to save the wandering hobbits, and yet he moronically lets them walk right into a dangerous tavern, whereas he could have introduced himself to them while he was spying on them earlier (when they were with Tom Bombadil, who knew Strider!), and prevented a near calamity.4) I felt it inconsistent that the Ringwraiths were on one hand so TOTALLY powerful and yet on the other hand so foolish and stupid. Didn't add up.But all that said, J.R.R., you ROCK!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I've been meaning to read it for years but never seemed to get around to it. I've loved the Hobbit and knew I would enjoy the Lord of The Rings, but just kept putting it off. Tolkein is truly a great writer. Typically I find that older books take more effort to read as the writing style just doesn't seem to flow easily. Pleasantly, this was not the case in Fellowship of the Ring. I was amazed by how fluent his writing style was for me. I was also very happy to note that a lot of the dialogue from the recent movie was taken directly from the book. It really made me appreciate the movie more. Peter Jackson really did a great job on the movies and it's evident that he's a true fan of the novels. That's about one of the highest praises I can give a movie, for they're usually nowhere near as good as the book. On to the review of the novel... *spoilers follow if you aren't familiar with the story*The Fellowship of the Ring takes place several decades after the Hobbit left off. Bilbo is now 111 (eleventy-one as Bilbo would say) and ready to go quietly off and enjoy his life to the end of his days. The ring is entrusted to Frodo's care. Through Gandalf's inquiries, we come to find out that the ring is the One Ring.\\"One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them.\\"Frodo must leave the Shire to keep the Shire safe and keep the ring out of the hands of the Ringwraiths and Sauron. Frodo's travels take him through many treacherous paths and eventually he makes it to Rivendell, the house of Elrond. This seems to be where Frodo shows his true valor. He originally thought his journey was over since the ring was in Rivendell. But, he vows to take the ring to Mordor once he sees the turmoil it creates. It is truly an evil ring and will corrupt even those who would use it for good. Nine set out for Mordor to destroy the ring; Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragron (known by many names - Strider, the Ranger, and Isildur's heir), Boromir (a man and a son of Gondor), Legolas (an elf), and Gimli (a dwarf and son of Gloin who was one of the dwarves in the Hobbit on Bilbo's grand adventure).The book follows them through the mines of Moria (where Gandalf stands against a Balrog), to Lothlorien (where we meet Lady Galadriel), and down the river towards a decision yet to be made - through the marshes towards Mordor, or over the mountain pass towards Gondor. This is where the Fellowship of the Ring ends - the Fellowship has a parting of the ways - Frodo and Sam go in one direction and the fate of the others in another."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Frodo Baggins, a hobbit from the land of the Shire, destined to take the One Ring of power to Sauron's kingdom. A pretty routine plot, considering the hundreds of other fantasy titles out there. What makes The Fellowship so special? Every detail of the book was planned out perfectly, the storyline fit together like a jig-saw puzzle, and the bone-chilling points in the book (such as the attack on their camp) are balanced with light-hearted scenes as well (Rivendell, Elves). J.R.R. Tolkien is without a doubt, one of the greatest writers of all time, right up there with Shakespear and Poe."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book, and the others that precede and follow it, are perhaps the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. Tolkien's incredible imagination, and the creation of several languages, contribute to the incredibly realistic world created here. After reading this book, as well as the related works, I was left wishing that I could actually visit Middle-Earth. Throughout the books, one gets the impression that Tolkien is relaying actual events, that occurred in an actual time and place. I have never read fiction which has so successfully immersed me in the setting as these works.

However understandable this may be, some &quot;critics&quot; eagerness to say that so-and-so is imitating Tolkein, or so-and-so isn't as good as Tolkein, they are losing sight of the fact that they aren't Tolkein. True most fantasy authors have read Tolkein and probably put a little of his style in their works, but the point to their novels is to entertain. For those of you who keep forgetting this, you should either stop reading fantasy or open your mind a little and get a life. It's getting annoying and for anyone reading these reviews, who isn't a fan of fantasy yet, he or she may get the wrong idea as to the point of fantasy books, and never get introduced to what fantasy has to offer. It's not based around Tolkien, regardless of how good his books are, or how he pushed fantasy into the mainstream. The point of fantasy is the same as in any other genre, to entertain.For people out there who are looking for entertainment and not something to bitch about, Tolkein is a great introduction to fantasy. If you have already read some fantasy and not Tolkein, pick his books up, they are really good."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I would personally suggest, especially for impatient people, that you begin reading this trilogy with &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and then &quot;Return of The King&quot;. You can come back to this one, and will appreciate it more. (I did this, because my parents owned only the latter books. I bought this one myself later on. And then The Hobbitt and Unfinished Tales, going backwards in a sense.) Several things will be mysterious, but that adds to the excitement in my view. Life is a mystery too."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring leads the reader on a journey of triumph and defeat. Yet, the reader is rewarded in the end with a feeling of content and satisfaction. The novel begins with a complex telling of the origin of &quot;hobbits&quot;, the odd, dwarf-like creatures that utilize much of the story's topics. The reader is then introduced to a ring, once in the clutches of the cunning Dark Lord, who wishes to conquer creatures living throughout the land. Yet, in order to do so, he must have in his posession the empowering ring that rules all. The only problem is, this ring is obtained by the hobbit-folk (Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo). And the hobbits are unaware of the danger of the ring. Not only does it make the wearer invisible, but it empowers them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I wish that the Lord of the Rings trilogy was the last story I have ever read in my life. I have been trying for 30 years to find a story that can fill the void left by finishing this trilogy. But I can't. I know now that all books to come will never satisfy me like these great works.

Believe me, I have tried it. So I read it a second time, after reading The Hobbit. It was good, I liked the characters and it was well written and a great story, but it seemed difficult to read because of so many references to things that had little to do with the rest of the story, especially the chapters that took place in Rivendell. My advice to anyone who wants to read Lord of the Rings is this: first, read The Hobbit. Go ahead and read this book, then The Two Towers and The Return of the King (you will probably like those two better). Then, read this book again after completing the trilogy. It will make much more sense the second time around, and you appreciate this book so much more. This really is a great series, and after exhausting myself with reading yet another Wheel of Time book (Robert Jordan fans can relate) I found myself re-reading the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I found to be a pleasant change of pace. Robert Jordan should have taken a few more notes from Tolkien's works before launching himself into his never-ending story. I think anyone will agree, Tolkien is often imitated, but never duplicated."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings, the 20th century's most important epic fantasy and a perennial for all ages. It presents a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, as he discovers that a family heirloom is actually a magic ring devised and then lost by a Dark Lord, and then sets off to destroy the ring before it can be seized back. Frodo and his company pass through many parts of Tolkien world of Middle-Earth, filled with many races of mythical beings.There are several ways to approach the work, and for myself the most fulfilling has been from a philological perspective. Tolkien was enamoured with languages of all kinds, and over the course of his life he created many, giving special attention and care to two, Quenya and Sindarin. These two constructed languages are loved by many fans of linguistics, and it is precisely in FELLOWSHIP that we have the most important example of mature Quenya. There are also several important snippets of Sindarin here, especially among place-names.Approaching the work as just good literature will be disappointing, however. Tolkien, a specialist on Anglo-Saxon, tended to write mostly in a faux-archaic style reminiscent of BEOWULF or &quot;The Battle at Maldon&quot;. This tone, outdated and overly simplistic, will soon annoy the reader. Fitting in with the style, cliches and repetition abound. How many times must the reader be told Aragon suddenly seems not ragged anymore, but kingly and proud? Also, there are no narrative illusions here; the plot moves as it is overtly presented. If you like untrustworthy narrators, and thin and nebulous accounts where the reader must carefully fill in the blanks, as is common with such writers as Vladimir Nabokov and Gene Wolfe, Tolkien will seem infantile to you.I do recommend reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and even moving on the all of the Lord of the Rings. If you are fond of language, then it will be a fulfilling and eye-opening work. If you are just looking for fine literature to enjoy, however, then it would probably be best to read something by an author with a more modern tone and better academic reception."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The one that started it all! Join Bilbo Baggins as his wish for adventure binds all of Hobbylta to a quest to save Middle Earth. Tolkien created a world all his own that invites the reader to stay just a bit longer.

In fact, I almost abandoned it a few times before I was over the 300th page. The story is very slow going, though the fact that the details sort of put up to it, though I still have no idea of why the 50 pages of mentioning about hobbit's names and family which has almost nothing to do with the plot. I can name a few books that balance the story very well, so that it keeps excite you up and down through out the story and not bored you to death(ie. foreverwar, hyperion, hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy).There are also many poems(songs in the story) through out the novel, which make no sense to me and seem to have to do nothing with the plot. Maybe because I simply don't understand poems, but that's just my opinion, no one is good in everything. Sometimes after half of the book(around 350th page), though, the story really picks up, and you start to feel as a part of the journey.The end cuts off as if you're only went through 1/4 of the story, which gives me hope(also make me feel stupid that I went through 500 pages for this) that the other two books would be good since the beginning as less background has to be told. In general, the plot is very good. However, I don't really like the idea of a big gap between good and evil, though that's not the case for the main character(if you know the story around Warhammer 40k, you would know what I mean.....everything has an evil-side in it). On the course of adventure, the main character would either meet good people OR bad people.......Anyways, it's a great book if you can pass through 300 pages of snail-moving story. For me, the fact that 1/3 of it is pretty good, I will give it a 3 stars though I've heard a lot of good things about this trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a good book(just not great) and I'm looking forward for the other two(and hope that they won't put me to sleep as the first)."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I love the first part of this book-Frodo is a relatable nobody. The scenes are super-cute, like the constant stream of postmen going up and down, and the party, and best of all, the 'shop' at Bag End. But then, what could have been really cute and funny dissolves into an endless timetable of horseback rides, taverns, and quests. It begins to look like a Indiana Jones pairs up with Tintin and the Thompsons to find Excalibur and the Holy Grail in one go, but on the way they run into Professor Calculus' pendulum, Morgan le Fay, the Black Pearl, and to top it off, the bad guy, Saucepan, I mean Sauron, becomes an evil Voldemort and they have to destroy his umbrella.

In short there was to much talking and sitting around a campfire, eating lavish meals in lavish halls and whatnot.

Now that we are through the book we only get a small showing of how good a Tolkien book can be. Overall it is a good book and everyone has to read it.

Frodo is the nephew of Bilbo, and has lived a fairly quiet life with his uncle in a hobbit-hole in a small village. Bilbo is famous in the village because once years ago he went away on a long journey and returned rich. No one is quite sure exactly what happened. And no one except those who were on the journey with him knows about the magical ring he brought back with him, that can make him invisible.Bilbo has decided that he wishes to leave his village and get away. So he throws a huge party and at the end of it he simply disappears. He leaves Frodo as his heir and leaves him everything, including the magic ring.Years later Frodo is visited by the wizard Gandalf, who was the one who sent Bilbo on his journey so long ago. Gandalf has news that the ring Frodo has inherited is very dangerous--it was forged by an evil wizard a long time ago, and it has incredible power. Frodo must take it to be destroyed where it was forged, and he must do it immediately. Bad things are beginning to waken all over the place, and Frodo must not let this ring get into the wrong hands. Thus his journey starts. This book tells the story of the first part of Frodo's journey to destroy the ring.This book has a bit more character development than \\"The Hobbit,\\" but it is still hard to get a grip on exactly what the characters are like. It was difficult for me to accept that things in this story were so urgent, yet Frodo and his companions spent long stretches of time not moving. It seems that the dark riders would have been upon them if they waited like they did in this story.

Curious, I went to find the first book, being the FOTR, to see what all the hype was about. Now, don't get me wrong. LOTR is good, but not as good as most people actually say it is. Sure, Tolkien created a interesting world full of unusual people. But must he go over every little detail? Sometimes he just keeps describing something for so long, my head starts to hurt and I keep losing my place or reading the same sentence over and over again. His dialogue is bland and there is really no emotion to it. The characters are just as bland as the dialogue. There is no or little character development in this book, despite its size. Characters should be 3D. Not that all of Tolkien's characters are flat. Actually, Bilbo is more 3D than Frodo. The other characters--Well I won't even start. The list is too long. I just fell asleep reading this book. Believe me, I tried really hard to read this book. But I just can't. I admire Tolkien for being able to create a world where fantasy rules, but the writer must be able to control his world freely and realisticly so that we can read it and enjoy it. It is sad to know that LOTR fans point their fingers accusingly to someone who writes something similiar to LOTR, but the book that person wrote is actually better than Tolkien's work himself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"(...)

Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me.

Harry Potter is a great lighthearted and witty mystery series set in a 'modern' wizard school. The Prydain Chronicles (the best books ever written) use wisdom, ideals, attitudes, and witty dialogue while at the same time completely but perfectly believably changing the main character from reckless boy to wise man as he discovers the truth about himself and being a hero.

It is a story about a company of travelers trying to distroy evil, and bring peace to all creatures that still live in Middle Earth. Frodo Baggins, Bilbos adopted nephew, inherets all of Bilbo's belongings when Bilbo suddenly dissapeares again. Frodo is a hobbit that isn't content with the way his life is. There is something missing, and Frodo feels that an adventure would fill that eymptiness in his life. Well that adventure comes when Gandalf, the wizard, shows up and tells him that the ring that he inhereted from Bilbo, is wanted by Saruman, an evil wizard. The only way to keep Saruman from having it, and anyonelse from using it, is to destroy it. However to destroy it they need to take it to Orodruin, the fire mountain. This mountain is the only place where it is hot enough to melt the ring. Frodo starts his journey with three other hobbits, Sam, Pippen, and Merry. They run into many dangerous situations in the first few weeks. They are only few of many. While on the road they run into a man named Aragorn, or Strider. He is a ramger who has traveled that way many times. He helps them get to Riverdale where Gandalf is waiting for them. However before they reach Riverdale, they run into troublr with the Black Riders and it almost leads to a fatal accident. Frodo and his group fight the Black Riders many times before the reach Riverdale, but they all make it to Riverdale. There they are joined on the journey by Gandalf,Boromir( a strong man ), Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf. From there the adventure becomes even more dangerous. They realize this when they are lead into dander and one of the company is lost in the darkness of the Abyss. However the company still moves on towars there goal, facing one danger after the next.

When Frodo finds out about the ring he wants to get rid of it, but the only way to get rid of it is to throw it in the fires where it was made. Him and his friends go on an adventure to bring it to the place of the fires. They did not know how difficult this was going to be. They had trouble with orcs, blackriders, and the spy's of Sauron (The Evil Lord). Many awesome things happen in this book. My summarizing is nothing compared to Mr. Tolkien's writing.

Like this kid.He said that Tolkien should have read the script before he had had writen the book. First of all let me alucidate you little ass, Jackson who made the movies wrote the scrip after tolkien died. Tolkien wrote the book and then there was a movie. Not too bright are ya. As for this other kid, he did not know how to spell most of the words he wrote. I mean yeah sure everyone mispells, but this kid had his whole review writen like a 5 year old. There was this other kid who did not know the plot. He said that frodo was killed on the 170th page, and gandalf was eaten by zombies. I know WTF. As for the rest of you I know this book is long and tedious. But hey guess what when you get to high school, I'm not speaking about zombie boy, or dislexia lad, you will read not only this sucker, but the iliad,the odessy, excuse, and all the real epic classics. In general this is a good warm up to those books. But if you want to keep on reading level 2 books like 'the little train that could' or 'curious george' hey it is 100% o.k with me.

Bilbo retires from his home and Frodo is left to adventure...the journey to destroy the ring.The plotline is somewhat simple,but the world building and metaphors Tolkien used make up for that.What was frustrating was that I could only understand the story when I immersed myself in reading for long stretches at a time...because it is poetic and lavishly detailed.I found it dissapointing (with its' length) that there wasn't more of a subplot going on. Yes there was dialogue between the characters but it did not seem to build up their friendships or characters much.Overall, it wasn't that exciting. There were monster scenes with little details and dinner scenes that seemed too drawn out.It was fun to read about the fantasy items like a ring that can turn you invisible and a bowl that can show you the: past, present, or future(the mirror of Galadriel). But I do not think will read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Although the author did a great job bringing to life the world of the Middle-Earth, I felt that there were to many points of view. To me, the storyline jumped around too much between characters."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Ok, so I have to say that I enjoyed this book better than \\"The Hobbit\\" but it still was a very hard read for me. Somehow I have never read these books until now and starting them as an adult, I think I may get something very different from them than most people do who were introduced to the series at an earlier age. While I admire Tolkien's imagination, I still find some flaws with this book. I've also seen the movies before reading which could also serve to change my views on the book.We start in the Shire where Frodo Baggins has just inherited Bilbo Baggins (another hobbit we learn about in \\"The Hobbit\\")house, furniture, and most especially, a prized ring, after Bilbo has disappeared suddenly and plans to go off traveling again. For years Frodo doesn't worry about the ring and enjoys his time in the Shire just getting along alright. However, Gandalf the Grey wizard returns and gives him some history on this tiny little ring that is very surprising. It is the greatest ring on Middle-Earth and dangerous. It's previous owner Sauron wants it back for his own and has started to send out evil creatures to get it back for himself. If that happens, the world is doomed. Trying to keep it away from the minions, Frodo and some friends, take a journey to the Elven kingdom of Rivendale where they join part of a fellowship that is going to take the ring back to the one place it can be destroyed, but right at the enemy's gates in Mordor. Accompanying Frodo are a few hobbits, an elf, Gandalf, a dwarf, and a couple of humans. They have to pass through much danger and tribulations to try to get Frodo away on his quest as he becomes the Ring-Bearer.The characters in this novel are interesting, but to me, not enough time is spent on them. I would have loved to hear more about Hobbit's habits or the history of some of the other characters, but instead, the book spends more time detailing other things. Even the elves whom some may know about in the movie aren't described quite as well in the book. In fact, Arwen is barely in this book, which may disappoint some people. He did do a better job on Galadriel who actually did get a larger part in this book. Sam has always been my favorite character and I wish there was more of him in this book.The writing is extremely descriptive and this bogs down the reader at points in the novel. There are so many names of places and things that we don't even visit in the book that are described that it can serve to confuse a reader and make them wonder why it was even mentioned in the first place. The scenery is described over and over as well which makes for reading that once in awhile I just had to put down as it bored me. My biggest complaint would be all the songs and poems though. I found them distracting and there were so many, I have to confess that I started just skipping over them so I could get on with the story. I might have missed something in the history or backstory because of this, and I would have much rather just had it written normally. That being said there isn't a great deal of violence in this book and not many things offensive either.All in all I would probably give this book 3.5 stars. It has a great story but its hard wading to get through that story. But I'll move on to the next and see what The Two Towers has to offer.The Fellowship of the RingCopyright 1954458 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I'm one of those people who saw the LOTR films before reading the novels. And now, I've just finished reading \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" last night, and I must say that I didn't really enjoy it as much as other people did. I mean no offense: I still think that LOTR is classic literature that should never be forgotten, but here's the thing . . .After I saw \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" on DVD (both the theatrical and the extended; I now own the Extended Edition), I went on to read different fantasy novels. I've read Robert Jordan's first ten books of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series, Robin Hobb's \\"The Farseer Trilogy,\\" Diana Pharaoh Francis's \\"Path\\" trilogy, Scott Lynch's \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" (I'll be reading his sequel soon), and so on. Through the years, I've noticed a fomulaic structure that are prevalent in some of these books: average guy/girl in small village goes on a quest, average guy is world's only hope, etc. Terry Brooks's first \\"Shannara\\" trilogy falls into that category very well. But anyway, while I still enjoyed these novels, I couldn't help but be a bit irritated that they included the same basic structure that's typical in the fantasy genre. And now that I've read \\"Fellowship,\\" I couldn't help but think of all the fantasy cliches in many other books. But I know that Tolkien's works were somewhat original back in the day, and that the cliches were formed to perfection throughout the later years.But that's not all. I found \\"Fellowship\\" to be a bit more light-hearted than the actual film, which is fine with me, but light-heartedness isn't for everybody. I grew up watching TV shows like \\"Millennium,\\" \\"Deadwood,\\" \\"24,\\" and \\"House\\". And you already know that there are lots and lots of adult situations in them. Well, I prefer these hard-hitting adult shows over those crappy half-naive half-melodramatic teenage shows like \\"One Tree Hill\\" or something like that. And you know what, I think all these adult shows have affected my reading of \\"Fellowship\\". I feel \\"Fellowship\\" wasn't intense enough to sustain my interest, but I guess it's just me.Now, I'll start with the CONS for this novel. \\"Fellowship\\" gets things going in the second half, but the first half is very slow and tedious. \\"A Long-Expected Party\\" and \\"The Shadow of the Past\\" were interesting enough (it's the history of the Ring that makes it all worthwhile), but then as I got to \\"Three is Company\\" it became a bit tedious. \\"A Shortcut to Mushrooms\\" and \\"A Conspiracy Unmasked\\" is when it started to slow down even more. Then, as I got to \\"In the House of Tom Bombadil\\", I couldn't help but be constantly irritated at its melodramatic overtones. Bombadil's a bit too much on the bright side. But then, the pace quickened up when I got to \\"At The Sign of the Prancing Pony\\" and \\"Strider\\". And some of the most intense sequences in LOTR are found in \\"A Knife in the Dark\\" and \\"Flight to the Ford\\"; this is when it becomes interesting again. As for the second half, \\"The Council of Elrond\\" was just downright hard to read through. Gandalf, Elrond, Men, Elves, and Dwarves just talking and talking and talking and talking. Though, lots of information on Saruman and the Ring are found here, it was just a very big hassle.But I have to say that the PROS are much better here. The concept of a hobbit going on this quest is highly unlikely, and that's why this book's so compelling. Tolkien broke the mold back in the 50's when he created Bilbo (for \\"the Hobbit\\") and Frodo Baggins. And having eight companions to follow the hobbit to Mount Doom makes it all the more exciting. Even though I don't find Hobbits very fascinating anymore, the thought of having one of them go on a journey to Mordor is still outstanding. And let's not forget the writing itself. Tolkien's imaginative narration soars above every page that's written here. It's all so rich in detail and amazing in imagery (Alan Lee's artwork really helps, too). And let's not forget the races. I know that orcs, elves, wizards, and dwarves are a cliche nowadays, but here Tolkien gives them something more. There's history, culture, social issues, and politics. Finally, the sequences in Moria and Lothlorien are brilliant in almost every way.I would have to say that television shows and other contemporary fantasy novels have affected my reading of \\"Fellowship\\". The epic content I admire, but the formulaic structure I should try to tolerate. And I think it's not just fantasy novels and TV shows: there's contemporary books like \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"The Ha-Ha\\" and \\"House of Sand and Fog\\".But anyway, I did enjoy the first part of LOTR, but not that much, sorry to say. I'm glad, however, that other people have enjoyed it much more. And I admire Tolkien for his creation of a beautiful imaginary world. Now on to \\"The Two Towers\\" . . .Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I admit I saw the movies before I read the books. I'm just finishing up The Fellowship of the Ring now, and I must admit, I had to skip some parts out of sheer boredom. I love the storyline and the character development, but some of the detail just seems kind of, well, not desperate, but Tolkien seemed determined to make this the longest book ever. I don't think all the descriptions were absolutely necessary for the story, nor were they really enjoyable either.I love everything in, and not in the movie, especially Tom Bombadil, who brings life and happiness to a very dark story. Over all, it is a very, very well written book, but a warning: There are parts you might have to skip, and don't worry, most of them aren't that important to the story.I'd suggest this to any Lord of the Rings fan, absolutely, and also to anyone who loves a great fantasy novel. It's very intriguing and entertaining, and there are many awesome poems and songs, but just be aware that the prologue makes it seem like it won't be a good book. To be honest, I skipped the prologue and still loved the book anyway. I recommend this strategy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Before the well reknowned movies came to being the Lord Of The Rings books were there. The first movie was one of the best movies of all time in an epic trilogy, however it does no justice for the book. This book has more battles and introduces you to the characters way more than the movie does. Although it is lengthy it is well worth it, and you may want to read it again. I recommend this book to all Lord of The Rings fans and all people who like any sort of adventure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This fantasy is a great book. It's a prefect fit if you want to read about an adventurer. The Lord of the Rings, the series, are my favorite books! It's about a hobbit (who is a human, but smaller then normal). He has this ring that is evil and owned by a magical being who has a army of orcs that are mined from the earth. The hobbit's name is Fredo and he must go to Mount Doom. Mount Doom is a mountain that has such flaming fire that it is the only thing that can destroy the ring. Unfortunately, it is right next to the being, Sauron. Will Fredo make it to Mount Doom and drop the ring in the fire or will Orcs and other creatures get him and eat his flesh alive?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in a trilogy of books by J.R.R. Tolkien, titled the Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Ring is about the forming of the fellowship and the beginning of the quest.The book starts out in a land called middle-earth. In middle-earth, many different creatures live. There is a place in middle-earth, called the Shire. most of the hobbits live in the shire. Frodo, after finding out the truth to his inherited ring, has to begin a journey to a place called Rivendell. Along the way, Frodo and his managiere face many strange foes and meet many new friends. Upon entering Rivendell, an elf by the name of Elrond forms the Fellowship of the Ring. Elrond chooses 9 beings to go on the quest, some Frodo knew and some he didn't. The Fellowship faced many hardships along the way and even lost some of their members.This book was an overall good book. The only things that I didn't like is how there are some really slow parts, for example there would sometimes be 15-25 page long stretches were the book only talks about how the Fellowship is walking. Then there was too many poems and songs. There were also some really interesting added bits to the book. Tolkien gave a history to the peoples of middle-earth and also created several languages."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"FOTR is really wordy and much too long. Could have been half as long and twice as good if Tolkien had removed all of the really unecessary description, histories, songs (esp. the songs, really pointless), etc. I found it very difficult to stay with this book. After reading the Hobbit, this book is just too slow."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I don't read many books but for some reason this caught my eye. Hearing about the upcomming movie I decided to read the book it came from. Reading more into the book I'm accaully looking forward to what the movie has to offer this fall. It takes a long time for the book to accaully take off but it gets better. The story of a guy still living on his 111th birthday is differant and he still lives on longer. By holding something magical, he has the power to live on longer. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it takes forever to get going, but they have to make the background before they travel and they take a long time. In the most part after they made the background in the novel I couldn't get my hands off the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"In despite of my great respect for Mr. Tolkien's personality and the fabulous fantasy universe he has created, I can't give any good credits to this book. It's very leisurely and hard to follow. It's difficult to tell what it really is that's wrong with the book. When I think about it rationally, the story should be extremely interesting. When I start to read it, it just bores me to death. No offense.This book is for dedicated fans only. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, read The Hobbit first."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"* I would really like to give this book 2.5 stars, but since that's not an option, I thought rounding up was more fair than rounding down.So after my third attempt to slog my way with Frodo and Company on their seemingly endless journey over every hill and through every forest in Middle Earth, I finally made it! Yea me!!!! As other reviews here have stated, I found the story to c-r-e-e-p by and my eyes had started to glaze over after the 110th description of a hollow or hill or tree or ravine or cliff - you get the idea. I also found parts of it to be filled with, for lack of a better word, WTF- erry. Tom Bombadil anyone? I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent and well-read person and I had no idea what anybody was talking about during that whole section.What really made this book a chore for me to read, though, was the total lack of warmth or humor. Yes, I know it's a dark, serious epic, but come on! Harry Potter (yes, I also know that the two series have been compared, analyzed, evaluated, blah, blah, blah to death) also has a dark undertone but Rowling still managed to add a little sparkle to her characters and story. I cared what happened to them. While reading Fellowship, on the other hand, I was kind of hoping Sauron would get the ring and kill them all - end this somehow! I can't take seriously characters who take themselves so seriously. Half of the speeches given in the council scene reminded me of the Holy Hand Grenade scene in Monty Python - excpet that was supposed to be funny! \\"And lo, we beheld the day on which PooPooRoRo, father of BlahBlah, son of STabMePlease crossed into the Plain of TerribleTerror and crossed the River of WordVomit...\\" That whole scene was so academic and pompous that I almost couldn't read it. Couldn't Aragorn have said, \\"Ok - here's the deal guys. I'm really supposed to be the king, but I kind of have an attitude problem and I'm a loner (besides that means a really hot, brooding actor will play me in the film) so I've spent the past few years wandering around, but now things are serious and we have to get it together and save Middle Earth.\\" Was it really necessary to detail the family history (including school records and traffic tickets) of everyone on the Council?However - having completely slammed this book - the writing is beautiful and the story (as far as I could tease it out of all of the other stuff) really is fantastic. Kudos to Tolkien for creating a total universe of his own that is obviously vastly influential to both the literary and cultural world. I mean, I read a 400 page book that I really didn't enjoy because I felt like I could barely consider myself literate if I hadn't read it! And I'm going to read the other two - which I've been given to understand are more entertaining. It is obvious that this world was real to Tolkien and I can appreciate that.But if I have to work as hard to read The Two Towers, I'm going to chuck it and turn on Monty Python..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I love fantasy and I love long books that are continued in a series.

It was an unnecessary evil."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The ring has once again found a new owner after spending many years in the hands of Bilbo it was thrust upon Frodo whose task is now to carry the ring out of the Shire and keep it out of the hands of the enemy, Sauron. The planning of Bilbo's 110th birthday was going as planned and only person that knew of Bilbo's planned vacation from the Shire was Frodo. At the party there were many fireworks, compliments of Gandalf the wizard, and other activities, and at the feast Bilbo disappeared after giving a speech and was not seen in the Shire again. Frodo discovered the ring and Gandalf told him to never use it even if the situation was dire. Gandalf left to do research and didn't return for many years but when he did he told Frodo that he would have to leave the Shire because it was no longer safe for him or the ring for ring wraiths were trying to find it. Frodo then sold Bag End (the place where he and Bilbo lived) and bought a small hole in Crickethollow to try to cover u the fact that he was leaving. Frodo started out on his journey to Crickethollow with Sam Gamgee and Perigrin Took (known as Pippin) and they were met by a group of elves and Frodo was named elf-friend. They decided to spend only a few hours and then the group of travelers, now including Merry Brandybuck, left at dawn. They decided to take a road through the Old Forest to find a way to Rivendell where they got into trouble but were saved by Tom Bombendil who gave them a good nights rest and then led them out of the forest, and then he told them to go to the Prancing Pony Inn to spend the night. At the inn they met a man named Strider who was a Ranger from the North and he helped lead them to Rivendell. After a few days they were caught by ring wraiths and they stabbed Frodo in the shoulder. The groups of travelers proceeded on but were chased again by the wraiths, but this timed an Elvin lord appeared and the wraiths were crushed under raging waters that had risen. They made it to Rivendell and Frodo was cured and reunited with Gandalf and Bilbo. After Frodo came to, they had a council to decide who would go on the quest with Frodo. At the first council it was decided that Sam would accompany Frodo on his quest, but on the second meeting it was decided that Aragorn, Legolas, Boromer, Gandalf Pippin, Merry, Sam, and Frodo was form the fellowship, and were tasked with the job of destroying the ring. They traveled for a long time with little problem but they hit bad weather and were forced to travel through the mines of Moria where they met a terrible beast and Gandalf met his fate. Then the company traveled on but entered the land of Caras Galadhon where the stayed for a while and decided that it was solely his purpose to destroy the ring. Then Frodo fled and Sam followed as they headed for Mordor, but the orcs caught up with the others and Merry and Pippin were captured and Baromer was killed. This was one of the best books I have ever read because it kept me engaged through the whole adventure.This was one of my favorite books because of how far the hobbits had to go just by themselves, even though they are not much taller than about three feet. First when they had to leave Bag End and travel through the forest instead of on the road with the lack riders on their tale all the way. Then in the Old Forest they were confronted by evil trees that were rotten at the core but they were eventually saved after days of horrible walking conditions by Tom Bombendil and Goldberry. Then after that they had to travel to the inn of The Prancing Pony all by themselves and stay secret to most people throughout their time in Bree.I loved this book greatly because of how he fights the desire to disappear t any moment. In the beginning when the black rider starts to chase Frodo through the grass and Frodo had the urge to slip the ring on his finger but he did not and they were saved by a group of elves. Then when they were in Barrow-Wights Frodo wanted to escape the place by disappearing but the urge to save his friends was stronger and he instead called upon Tom. Then while on the road with Strider, Frodo also had many thoughts about disappearing.I also really liked this book because of the variety of characters throughout the story. First there are the hobbits from the Shire who are brave, kind, and thoughtful, but they are small and not the smartest people. The elves such as Elrond and Legolas are very tall and wise and know many things about the world. Then are the men and dwarves who are Gimili (the dwarf) who is short of temper and sometimes rash in his decisions, then there is Baromer who secretly and desperately wants the ring for Gondor to revive its glory. Then there is Aragorn who is a decendent of Isildor and is also wise and strong and will protect Frodo always at any cost.I liked this book because of characters like the heroic Aragorn and Frodo; also because of how Frodo fought against the will of the ring, and because of how the hobbits manage on their own. Frodo fought against the ring many times against the black riders and evil people of the land. It was also amazing that the hobbits made it all the way to Bree after being chased all the time by the black riders. This was one of my favorite books and I will the treasure the experience that I had while reading it.R.

To summarise, it DELIVERS. The Fellowship of the Rings may be long and complex, but is the epitome of all that is simple literature. JRR Tolkein uses his remarkable poetic and philological talents to guide us through an entirely distinct universe, and in the fashion of Classical, Norse and Irish legend and mythology envigorates the mind with each twist and turn in the basic struggle against good and evil. With the literary skill of a master seanacha&iacute;, he relates the tales of a new quasi-mythology...this book isn't fantasy, to an open-minded reader it is a new level of reality; we may learn as much from the thematic structure of the Lord of the Rings than we do from the innards of a history book. No other novel has delved as deeply into the mind of the author, and none have manifested these ideas as well to the reader.

Not so here, I swear I looked at the page numbers all of the time and got nowhere. I read the first 200 pages (which were really boring) then got to the interesting part. Unfortunatly the report on it was due the next day so all day I spent reading it page by page until it was finished. Moria was good Rivendell and Elf Land were dragged out quite alot.

The characters are well rounded and three dimensional - a rare occurence in works of fiction. The prose wafts along agreeably, absorbing the reader into the incredible world of Middle Earth. The first time I read this book I was so enchanted by the whole aura of the setting that for weeks I lived in Middle Earth alone. Now, I read it not for the story - which I know inside out - but for the feeling of home I get when reading it. The warmth and detail of Tolkien's writting is uplifting. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"everyone told me that this first book was in fact a bit boring but that the other two parts were much more enthusiastic. i don't see why because i'm just reading the 2nd part now. 1st part is as great as the 2nd one(as far as i've read of the 2nd part).i just loved it and felt myself living in that world too. i could even cry when i thought that Gandalf was dead forever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is Great.But not the best of the three.I'm half-way through The Two Towers and I can say it is better then the Lord of the Rings.I think what makes it not as good is it's not as action packed as The Two Towers and it has one LONG chapter called The Counil of Elrond.true this chapter gives you all sorts of information.But it's too long and nothing happens.However this book is worthy of it's fame."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have read the trilogy five or six times and I can honestly say it is the best series of books I have ever read. One wonders why a full length film version has never been attempted. For those attempting it for the first time I would recommend skiping the intro and going straight to Chapter 1. Once you have read the first chapter you will be hooked and then is a good time to backtrack to learn a little more of 'Hobbit Lore.

I am halfway through \\"Two Towers\\" and i stopped reading to work on the list but i am planning to finish it this summer. The Fellowship of The Ring is one my favorite book.

Lately it has been given even more praise, due to its appearances in the movie theatre. Personally, I thought \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" to be no more than a decent read. Tolkien focuses much on character development rather than progression of the plot, which sometimes caused me to put the book down and go clip my toenails, because doing this simple task was more entertaining than reading this book. I have to give Tolkien credit in the level of thought and detail he put into the world of Middle Earth. He gave the reader vivid images of the characters' surrounding (sometimes a little too vivid.) I do have to say that this book is a good tale, but after reading, I wasn't eager to jump into the next novel into the series."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingBy: J.R.R. TolkienReviewed by: W. HorngPer.6This story talks about Frodo, a hobbit, who get hold of the Ring of Power and he had to destroy it in the mouth of Mt. Doom. At the beginning he was just a regular hobbit when his uncle Bilbo's old friend, Gandalf, came to celebrate Bilbo's 110th birthday! Gandalf found out that Bilbo has a magic ring but doesn't know that it was the Ring of Power. When he found out, he gave the ring to Frodo and told him to leave the Shire and go to the Prancing Pony to meet him. That's when Frodo and his friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry met Aragorn, a warrior who's suppose to be the king of Gondor. Together, Aragorn, Frodo, and his friends went to Rivendell, where the elves live. After they arrived at Rivendell, many people were gathered around to discuss how to destroy the Ring. Frodo volunteered with Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir,and Frodo's friends. So the nine companions set out to Mt. Doom. Will they destroy the Ring of Power???I like this book because it's so intense and amazing that you don't want to stop reading, especially when they were battling with the orcs or Urak hais. The sad thing was that the fellowship broke very soon after Gandalf fell down from the bridge of Khazad-dum with the Balrog that he was fighting with. The last words he said was to Frodo, \\" Run, you fool!\\" That part almost made me cry. It must felt really bad to watch as an old friend fall to his doom.The part that I don't like about the book is Sauramon betraying the good and joining forces with Sauron, the Lord of the Rings who can destroy all of what is good in Middle-earth. Gadalf was shocked when he heard Sauramon said,\\" Let's join with sauron, it's a much wiser choice.\\" Gandalf refused to join with Sauron so Sauramon held him as capitive, luckily, he escaped. Gandalf left Sauramon with these words, \\" There is only one Lord of the Rings and he will not share his power.\\"My favorite part was when Frodo thought he got stabbed by the cave troll and was about to die, but he was wearing mythril, an armor light as a feather and as hard as dragon's scale, so he survived. I also like frodo's sword, Sting. I like it because each time when orcs are near, the sword glows, the brighter the closer the orcs are. If I have those things, then I wouldn't be afraid of battling anyone(Well, maybe except Demons and Balrogs)."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent book just as his others. There are three books in the whole story that are very elaborate. Every character fits perfectly in the story like Tolkien knew about the history that no one else had. In the Fellowship, It explains a lot about each character's story and why they were chosen to go on this amazing quest. I liked Tolkien's detail to the environment in the story. You can almost see in your head where the characters are. I would though, have liked to see what the characters were talking about on some of the long journeys, or more of how the characters reacted to each other."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I believe that this story is J.R.R. Tolkien's test to himself as a writer. It was to see whether or no he could start from nothing and bulid up a whole new world for his audience to look at. He created lands, peoples, geographical structures, and family histories. It is the perfect fictional world in the eye of J.R.R. Tolkien. In my opinion he succeeded, yet not only did he succeed he shocked his audience. It is a great strory of a journey of faithful friends and their fight against evil that everyone interested in fantasy fiction should read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings: Felloship of the Rings, is the start of the greatest adventure in the history of middle earth. Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, is sent out to destroy a ring, made by an evil lord. The only way to destroy the powerfull ring, is to drop it into the cracks of doom, where it was made. Frodo sets off in this adventure, and soon runs into trouble.This book keeps you wondering about the evil forces and thier powers, since they are very hard to see at first. The book displays many common problems we have today. It shows how idiotic some discrimination is. The dwarf wasn't allowed to walk through the woods of the elves without wearing a blindfold. The elves were enemies with the dwarfs, because they believed in diffrent things, just as some people hurt others because of religion or race, which is very wrong. The story also shows that one person can make a difference. Frodo made the journey to his first destination injured, but he did his job. And he was just a small halfling against the forces of evil. There are more relations, and I could go on, but I think you understand. English teachers can have a fun time thinking of projects to do off of this book.This book is a medival fantacy style book. This book is for people with around an 8th grade reading level, yet to fully understand the books English, it would help to be a better reader. I think that if you want to read the Lord of the Rings, get through this book fast, before you lose intrest, then get into the other books, which have more action."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Frodo is a hobbit who has just inherited a mysterious magical ring from his Uncle Bilbo. Gandalf, a wise wizard and close friend of Frodo, advises him to never wear the ring and to keep it hidden, safe, and secret. Gandalf tells Frodo that an ancient and evil lord named Sauron forged the ring to rule the other magic rings possessed by dwarves, men, and elves. In resistance to this ring, men and elves battled the forces of Sauron, eventually defeating him. The ring was then believed to be lost. Thousands of years later Bilbo found the ring and passed it on to Frodo, however Sauron had reawakened and was seeking it. To prevent Sauron from obtaining the ring Frodo had to journey to Mordor, the forging place of the ring, to destroy it.The book The Fellowship of the Ring goes on to tell the extraordinary tale of Frodo and his eight companions as they journey to Mordor to destroy the ring. However, the Fellowship doesn't survive the journey into Mordor, and Frodo, with his best friend Sam, must finish the task alone.The book and the movie The Fellowship of the Ring differ from each other. For example, in the book the Fellowship did not fight a cave troll in Moria, but just see one. When the Company reaches Lothlorien it takes them several days of hiking through the forest before they reach the elf city of Lorien and speak with Lady Galadriel. The movie also doesn't show most of the places that Frodo visited during his quest, such as Tom Bombadil's house and the Barrow Downs.The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who likes an exiting and suspenseful read. The Two Towers and The Return of the King are sequels to The Fellowship of the Ring and are equally exiting. The Hobbit is the enchanting prelude to the Lord of the Rings books and explains how Bilbo found the ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book was one of the best books I ever read.

If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books. I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again. I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed. The movie is good, but it is different from the novel. Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading. As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out. Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.This novel opens my imagination. That is why I love Tolkien's work. It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder. I can feel myself in the journey. Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen. I am there. The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination. The nights before entering Moria. The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels.

There is no way to describe the entire world JRR Tolkien created from his (huge) imagination. Anyway, try to think about a world, similar to our world in the middle ages, where there is MAGIC. Not these tricks you are used to in real life, but real magic: a kind of power that comes from every living being. People that are really connected to nature, trees that can think and speak ... and everything in this world has a very well defined history: the beginnings, the myths, legends, kings ... everything told in words that reflect the author's sensations about his own dream. Even poetry you'll find in this book.The Fellowship of The Ring, being the fist part of The Lord of the Rings (usually published in three volumes), is the most polemic of Tolkien's works. This book has been read by many people since it appeared in print, and Tolkien himself received lots of letters filled with opinions, critics, and whatsoever. This story is a huge one, and there are people who dislike big stories. The first part of this book is concerned with providing a background to the saga and to make a link with The Hobbit, the previous book in chronology. This way, things seem to be slow and there's almost no action. For those who have read The Hobbit, a very nice and dynamic book, the first part of The Fellowship of the Ring may (but not probably) be boring. In fact, it's almost necessary to read The Hobbit before thinking of reading The Lord of The Rings; otherwise, much of the fun in this book will be lost.However, in the second part (Book II), action comes back, and now we have the characters dealing with a never-ending series of adventures, puzzles, dangers ... In other words, this book is worth the money you're gonna spend on it. But remember: before doing that, read The Hobbit!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"With all the hype over the movies there is a great opportunity to encourage reading.

It is so powerful that it calls people, elves, dwarves and hobbits alike and dements their mind so much that they can only follow Sauron. Thus begins the adventure of 4 daring hobbits, an elven archer, a wise wizard, a feisty dwarf and a powerful soon-to-be king.While it is a very good book, if you do not like fighting, gore, or extremely intense cliffhangers, do not read this book.

This is an actual reading of the entire book, not a dramatization or an abridged version.I think the reading is very good. The reader has a very good voice and he varies it to represent the voices of the different characters.The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that there are some cases where the reader voices the characters differently than I would imagine. This might not be a problem if I had never read the book before, but since I have, I have an idea of what I think the characters sound like, and what I think their emotions are in particular scenes. In some cases, the way the reader voices the characters doesn't match what I already had in mind.I'm sure that any reading by another person would never match how I imagine all of the scenes, so I would probably feel this way with any reading or dramatization.

But I loved it (although I hated the actual reading part. Now I have read it sixteen more times, and I can safely say I know where everyone is coming from.

No other book is so rich and detailed with the history and peoples of its world and no other book tells a tale of such magnitude and beauty. So many people today have such short attention spans and require such consistant melodrama that it's no wonder the beauty and detail of Tolkein's masterpiece ends up wasted.

It is rich and beautiful, crafted with a skill and likely to enjoy the amazing depth with which Tolkien shapes his world, nor are they likely to be able to tolerate a book that does not rely solely on battles to advance the plot. Those who adore epic adventure, huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love* this book.'The Fellowship of the Ring' starts things off wonderfully, telling the tale of the ring, and giving the reader a feeling of how vast and evil the story behind the ring is. Frodo and his companion must endure a series of adventures and encounters, trying to make their way out of the Shire. The first half of the book is very much reminicent of The Hobbit, and picks up with the same spirit.The second half of the novel gathers together the party who will make the journey that is the center of the series, and features one of the most famous and beloved parts of the series - Moria. Fantastic!Recomended for all readers, young and old.

It's true that it's a great story and that Tolkien creates a world that is totally immersive and believable (even down to the history and structure of the imaginary foreign languages). More importantly though, he has a deep-rooted sense of ethics that he has woven into the story that strikes a harmonic chord in the soul of the reader - for example, that wisdom is often more powerful than strength, that hunger for power or money is bad, that sometimes the harder path is the best, that displaying one's power (or wealth) is bad, and that sometimes it's better to not use power even if you have it. (Consider Aragorn, an heir to the throne who wears muddy boots and lurks in the shadows). From a literary point of view, these concepts are similar to the teachings of Jesus, which are obviously very powerful. Tolkien's anti-materialistic view of the world may be what moves readers so much and what pushes the series beyond being just technically great (which it is) to being almost a religous experience. The only things I found disappointing were the loose ends that weren't tied up at the end and the hints of the decline of Middle Earth towards being a world like our own."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The young hobbit Frodo Baggins has been chosen to go on a daring quest.A few words from the encourager. I have always enjoyed a good fantasy tale, and a heroic quest. It all started when I saw the animated cartoon based on the best selling book The Hobbit. Back then I was too young to read a thick novel.Aventualy I read the book The Hobbit. Now I am reading the conclusion series The Lord of the Rings. I have just finnished volume one The Fellowship of the ring, and I will be reading volume two The two towers very soon.The Fellowship of the Ring is focused on the young hobbit Frodo, and the evil one ring.If you do not know a Hobbit is a being slightly shorter than a dwarf, they have leathery and hairy feet, and often curly hair.Frodo, along with his eight companions Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas, must send the ring into the fire it was created.The one rinc can help the evil sorcerer Souron destroy all good in middle earth.Can Frodo, and his companions put the ring into the fires of Mount Doom? Read the book, and find out.I sugest you read The Hobbit before you read The Lord of the Rings , because it will help you understand the story line of the conclusion.The only thing I don't like about this book, is it started to bore me for a while, but my interest returned. Never give up if it bores you, because your interest will return!If you like a daring quest, heroic adventures, and a good story line The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings are the books for you.I will end this with a quote from the book.In elven &quot;Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbitul, ash nazg thrakatuluk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul!&quot;In English &quot;One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I first read his books when I was in 4th grade and every two years or so I return. I cannot think of another book in print (other than the Bible) that people return to again and again throughout their lives. Tolkien made you feel his tale. His mastery of language allowed us to experience vividly the grandeur of Middle Earth. The languages, cultures and histories of its peoples are rich and real as any from ours. The elvish and dwarven tongues are not just nonsensical sounds slapped together but actual languages that he laboured to produce. The poetry and the songs added a weave to the tapestry of cultures that demanded to be believed. The characters that he breathed life into were real in every sense. Their thoughts acts and motivations were not simply one dimensional: Good men were bad, the brilliant made errors, some people were lucky, others not so, the herioc last stand didn't always save the day, war is very ugly and glory is fleeting, travelling on foot is very hard especially over mountains and through wastelands, eating a good meal, drinking good beer and smoking a pipe is a nice way to spend an evening. Anyone who has ever been in the military would appreciate the proper place given to the joy of a simple bath, rest and food after leagues of cross country travelling. I do not despise those who cannot wade through the reality in this fantasy. It is on a level that some may find daunting. I agree with the fellow described it as art, high art. Not everyone will get it, not everyone can &quot;get&quot; it. I must in closing, take a parting shot at those who would place Robert Jordan near him let alone over him (I blame America's education system). If it wasn't for Tolkien, Jordan would have had to rip off someone with talent closer to his own, assuring you of a tale even more dreadful than the one he spun. You won't see reviews about people not being able to comprehend his work, because it is already dumbed down for the masses. There is a reason whyTolkien's work is so beloved, because it is simply that good and that unique. The man himself is an interesting study and worthy of some time.

He's brilliant in using just as few words as necessary to describe the beings, the landscapes and the events taking place around Frodo, Gandalf and the other members of the fellowship of the ring. His dialogues are charming, pointed and so rich of both hints crucial to the plot and references to events that took place centuries ago on middle-earth.

The story flows thru the subsequent chapter like a jolly mountain brook, now and then running thru wild currents, as the companions encounter new and dangerous obstacles. But with each chapter, the creek becomes wider and in the end, it becomes a wild river, when the fellowship breaks apart at the waterfalls of Rauros. Of course two scenes stand apart from the rest. The dwarven mines of Moria are just fantastic, and whenever I reached Balin's gravestone I had goose bumps while reading. &quot;We're cut off. We can't get out ... they're coming!&quot; So few simple words, yet so much drama in that specific situation. And of course Galadriel's mirror. When Frodo offers the one ring to the elven mistress, and she resists the temptation to use the ring to preserve everything that's left of her previous life, to save Lothlorien, and instead decides to stay herself and rather whither away in beauty than become a queen of darkness and despair, the reader gets a glance at the love that Tolkien sensed for this world and his work.So, whenever you're in need of a good read and of some enchantement to lighten your mood, take LotR from your dusty book shelves and jump back into the lands of Middle-Earth, and follow the cute band of Hobbits on their adventures far away from the Shire."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is for sure the best book ever written.If you are young, prepare yourself to live a grown-up adventure.

There is no way to describe the entire world JRR Tolkien created from his (huge) imagination. Anyway, try to think about a world, similar to our world in the middle ages, where there is MAGIC. Not these tricks you are used to in real life, but real magic: a kind of power that comes from every living being. People that are really connected to nature, trees that can think and speak ... and everything in this world has a very well defined history: the beginnings, the myths, legends, kings ... everything told in words that reflect the author's sensations about his own dream. Even poetry you'll find in this book.The Fellowship of The Ring, being the fist part of The Lord of the Rings (usually published in three volumes), is the most polemic of Tolkien's works. This book has been read by many people since it appeared in print, and Tolkien himself received lots of letters filled with opinions, critics, and whatsoever. This story is a huge one, and there are people who dislike big stories. The first part of this book is concerned with providing a background to the saga and to make a link with The Hobbit, the previous book in chronology. This way, things seem to be slow and there's almost no action. For those who have read The Hobbit, a very nice and dynamic book, the first part of The Fellowship of the Ring may (but not probably) be boring. In fact, it's almost necessary to read The Hobbit before thinking of reading The Lord of The Rings; otherwise, much of the fun in this book will be lost.However, in the second part (Book II), action comes back, and now we have the characters dealing with a never-ending series of adventures, puzzles, dangers ... In other words, this book is worth the money you're gonna spend on it. But remember: before doing that, read The Hobbit!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What's to say, tolkien's a very good author in his own way. You don't feel his character's though, you don't care about them much. 500 pages seems really really long in this books. You know how in some books you hardly noticed that you've read 100 pages. Not so here, I swear I looked at the page numbers all of the time and got nowhere. I read the first 200 pages (which were really boring) then got to the interesting part. Unfortunatly the report on it was due the next day so all day I spent reading it page by page until it was finished. Moria was good Rivendell and Elf Land were dragged out quite alot. I give it three because it's very high quality writing. Structurally sound. I just failed to pick it up and soar...if you get my meaning. Don't get me wrong though, the hobbit and the rest of the trilogy are really good."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I really love Tolkien's writing and I was happy to find a non-abridged reading of it that I could use to share my passion with my non-reading family, but all this recording did was put everyone to sleep and probably put them off picking up the book forever.This reader slaughters the text. I'm sorry, but I don't know how else to say it. I know some people here have said that he performed it on stage before recording it, but I find that hard to believe. Did anyone pay to see him? He reads as if he had never seen the books before and had put no time into familiarizing himself with the material. He never puts the emphasis where it belongs and his sentence melody is so off that a lot of the time you have to concentrate to even be able to follow what he is saying. I mean, Tolkien is not really easy listening material, he needs someone to bring out the allure and beauty in the text. I had hoped for someone who could do for the whole book what Ian McKellen did for Gandalf's lines in the movie, but instead this guy reads it like a laundry list.Anyways, I could go on, but you get the picture.

I was unsure of what to make of them.As far as the Tom Bombadil character: What is his purpose? Is he symbolizing something or an error in the plot?A long work, yes? The films are visually extraordinary, but I wonder if NOT reading the books puts one at a disadvantage when seeing them (the films).&quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot; chapter is probably the best in this first book of the trilogy inasmuch as it explains a great deal of background.Personally I prefer the third book &quot;Return of the King&quot;."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I had heard about this book that the plot was slow, but it was a good book anyway because the setting and the &quot;world&quot; the characters are placed in was so good.

This happened to Frodo in the book The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is a fantasy book and it's the beginning of the series of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" The book's main character is called Frodo Baggins, and his problem is that his cousin Bilbo disappeared from his party and left him with the responsibility of destroying the ring at Mt. Doom. He also has to face several challenges before he reaches the Anduin River, which leads to Mt. Doom Frodo is friends of most of the hobbits that live at Hobbiton, except for his cousins, the Sackville-BagginsI read the book very carefully, considering that it had a very high level and it was long. I sometimes stopped in parts I didn't understand, but afterwards, I moved on. I got to a point where I couldn't keep myself in the chair of the excitement and I started to jump while reading. In the prologue, I got to the point where my head almost drooped after reading the first page because it was so boring, but that's only on the prologue. I reconsidered abandoning the book three times, but my \\"book mates\\" told me not to. Something interesting about this book is that from the most interesting parts to the most boring parts, and that makes me sort of upset. This book is similar to \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\" by Lloyd Alexander because there are different races besides humans, like dwarves, elves, and wizards. I think that the book is very colorful because its magical writing can cheer you up, just like colors do. Also because its enriched with the good use of vocabulary.I would recommend this book to male teenagers and adults because it doesn't talk about things that girls regularly do or enjoy, like fighting, for example. This book is very similar to the chronicles of Prydain which has the same type of characters. Even though this book is challenging, you have to give it a chance and don't give up on it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The trilogy, and Fellowship in particular, helped to shape my childhood. It opened the doors of perception far more than Aldous Huxley or LSD ever could have. Tolkien is a creative master with talent far beyond what I would have thought possible.

When the reproductive cycle of algae is more interesting than this work of fiction, you know you're in trouble.Let me sum up the plot of this 400+ pg book for you: Frodo and co pack their bags, rest, eat a good meal, and walk. Walk, walk, walk through the forests, walk to Elrond's house, walk to Moria, walk to where the elves live. AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. Occasionally, some &quot;dark forces&quot; strike, but it is all very anti-climactic. Tolkien's writing style is never intense, so if you're getting drowsy as you read, you might gloss over the fact that the characters were just attacked and think that they were just walking as usual.Ok- let's give Tolkien credit for creating this extremely detailed world, new languages, for defining the genre and influencing generations of fantasy writers to come. Fine. But plot? No. Characterization? None whatsoever. Entertainment? You've got to be kidding.I really wanted to like this book. Everybody else does, even people who don't generally like to read. What am I missing? Perhaps that I never read this book as a child?Tolkien has inspired some really amazing artwork and the previews for the coming movies look awesome.

After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed &quot;Not another goddam elf!!??&quot;. Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is a mindless, poorly written, utter bore."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Last year I read the Hobbit and thought it was pretty good, so I decided to read the LOTR. About halfway through The Fellowship Of The Ring, it started to get really boring and I about gave up. But for some reason I decided to read the whole thing. Finally, I got through the book and bought the second book, The Two Towers, thinking it would be more exciting and that there would be more fighting. But, was I wrong. I finally gave up at about 4/5 the way through. A few months back, however, I decided to give the LOTR another try because everyone kept talking about how great it was. I painfully got through the first book for the second time and was halfway through the second book when I just got so bored I started skiping pages. Finally, I got through the second book and I guess if you read the first two books you have to read the third. So, I bought the last book and pretty much skimmed through all the pages. In fact, all I can remember is how the ring was destroyed! I wanted to like LOTR, I really did, but I guess I never will.

Here are the reasons why this book is so incredibly boring, slow moving, and often frustrating.ok, first of all, Tolkien spent more time describing the scenery than he did anything else.There's hardly any character development. I mean, honestly, the book is more surroundings rather than narration. Plus, the book was just too wordy.Not enough action. Where are the battles? Tolkien had the talent of creating a good battle scene, but, unfortunately, there were hardly any action scenes, and the ones that were there you had to get through atleast a hundred pages of fluff, and in the end the battle scene was only two pages long!Needed more excitement. Oh man, I don't even wanna begin to tell you how much minimal, (yes, MINIMAL) excitement this book has. The movie was ten times better, no make that one hundred times better. No, make that a thousand time better.Overall, I wouldn't be willing to spend one dime on any of these books. I read one hundred pages of the fellowship, and it was just so boring. Where were all the good battle scenes? Where were the monsters? There were hardly any other creatures of interest besides Orcs and Hobbits. That's basicly it.I just don't like any of the lord of the rings books. I want action books, not only with action, though. I don't expect an action scene every two pages, I just want an action scene atleast every one hundred pages! I also want a book that has SOME KIND OF EXCITEMENT OR A HOOK! this book didn't supply that at all. Plus, it's frustrating. Why is it frustrating? Because it has nothing which makes the quality of a book good. That's it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There is so much to be said against The Lord Of The Rings that it shouldn't be worth the effort. A book that, judged by conventional standards, contains so many appalling lapses of taste and so much coarse vulgarity really ought, by now, to have faded from sight.From many points of view, it has dated badly, and its aesthetics and politics are now so odd that you might be forgiven for thinking, as Peter Jackson's new trilogy of movies rapidly approaches, that its appeal, after all, is one of a delicious period piece.But all judgements have always been confounded by this extraordinary book. It ought to be too long, and too pointlessly abstruse, to command wide popularity; it is not a book for children, and yet not a book for adults either; its style is too elevated for popular literature, but too coarse for &quot;high&quot; literature. There is no reason on earth for anyone to like it, and there are plenty of readers who still think that the judgement of JRR Tolkien's first publisher - who was surprised when it started to look as if the book might make as much as 1,000 - was much sounder than the people who, in the past 50 years, have bought more than 100 million copies of the book.However, by now, The Lord Of The Rings is unarguably a part of English literature. Contrary to popular belief, 100 million readers can perfectly well be wrong; but the continuing life of the book cannot just be ignored. It is just there, massively.But, in many ways, it is just awful. It is amazingly humourless, and Tolkien knows it - over and over again, he writes &quot; 'Come, master Pippin!' Gandalf laughed&quot; - a very bad sign, all those laughing wizards. You don't have to be politically correct to be mildly alarmed by some aspects of it. Apart from Eowyn, the women in it are not madly significant, or allowed to do anything much. There is Galadriel, who stays at home being Wise; there are Goldberry or Rose, who stay at home being Patient Helpmeets; there are Lobelia Sackville Baggins and Shelob, who stay at home being completely ghastly.It is an appallingly nave fantasy of good and evil races; mostly, the good people are tall and blond and speak Nordic or Celtic languages, and the bad ones are dark and hairy and talk a sort of Persian - those guttural dwarves are allowed a sort of virtue, but it is rather grudging in tone. Sam Gamgee is a loyal retainer of the most frightful variety, still &quot;Mr Frodo-ing&quot; away and knowing his place 1,000 pages in; basically, he is Dickens's Sam Weller, and Tolkien couldn't even be bothered to change his name.Tolkien probably knew as much about language as anyone, but it would be fair to say that his interest stopped at grammatical inflection. The Lord of the Rings, by ordinary standards, is just badly written. Great swathes of it are in a sort of Ben-Hur biblical: &quot;And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them... until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords...&quot;There are endless mock subtleties of the &quot;It seemed to Sam that he saw...&quot; variety. And there is, too, that infallible sign of a really bad writer, the overuse of the word &quot;suddenly&quot;. Everything in The Lord of the Rings happens suddenly, dozens of times a chapter. And yet it is one of those very rare books that confounds all objections, all standards, and which in the end may make its own standards. Nobody, I think, has ever produced anything with the imaginative density and intricacy of the book. The reviewer's clich&eacute; is, for once, apt here; he really created a world.The power and resonance of the book come in part from an ethical debate that is much more adult than one remembers - it is haunted by the cruelty of its age, and is not, in fact, just about the alternative of Good and Evil, the elves and the orcs, but largely about the possibility of becoming evil through the best intentions. It is really about slow corruption, and is at its finest in the portraits of Saruman and Denethor, characters who it is not difficult to parallel in 20th-century history.But its claim on real greatness comes from the sense of huge, half-glimpsed vistas of history and language, the illusion (which may not be an illusion) that its author knew exactly the languages each of its characters would have spoken and understood the events of ancient history that lead all of them to act as they do.In a realistic novelist, writing about a real war, this would be a remarkable feat of intelligence; when you consider that Tolkien invented absolutely everything - the backstory, the languages, the geography - it quickly becomes almost incredible. At some point, the critics and the literati have to admit that they were just wrong, and, by now, it is probably time to start considering his extraordinary flight of imagination as one of the key works of modern literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I read the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; section and the first chapter and then immediatly returned it to my library.

Prior to its publication (July 24, 1954), fantasy adventures were aimed at young readers, including Tolkien's previous work - \\"The Hobbit\\" which was published nearly 17 years prior. While \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" still centers on the adventures of the child-like Hobbits, the material is much darker and more serious than its predecessor. Tolkien also showed that one can deal with serious themes (machine vs. nature) in fantasy writing.Tolkien preferred the name \\"The War of the Ring\\" to the eventual title of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and he wanted it published in a single volume as part of a two-volume set which would have also contained \\"The Silmarillion\\", but Tolkien did not have much influence at that time, and so the Publisher dictated that the single work would be divided into three books, the first of which is \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\". Each of the three volumes is then divided into two books, though this volume also contains a prologue entitled \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which summarizes the events in \\"The Hobbit\\" as well as provides background material about what type of beings Hobbits are.The first book is titled \\"The Ring Sets Out\\" and covers the events of Bilbo Baggins leaving the Shire after his birthday, the transfer of the ring from Bilbo to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, and the adventures of Frodo, Samwise Gamgee (Sam), Merriadoc Brandybuck (Merry), and Peregrin Took (Pippin) as they escape from the shire and travel to Rivendale. In addition, the reader is introduced to Gandalf, Strider/Aragorn, Fredegar Bolger (Fatty), Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, and Glorfindel. The reader is also introduced to the Nazgl, who and pursuing the ring. The events in this book take place over numerous years, though once the hobbits leave the shire it is a shorter period of time.The second book is titled \\"The Ring Goes South\\", though it has also been called \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" and covers the time at Rivendale. There we learn about Saruman turning on Gandalf and imprisoning him at Orthanc, and we meet the other members of the fellowship, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli. In addition there is Gl&oacute;in (Gimli's father whom the reader would have met in the Hobbit), and Galdor. The book then covers their travels, from the failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains at Caradhras through their travel through Moria, to the forest of Lothl&oacute;rien where they meet Celeborn and Galadriel. The book ends with the breaking of the fellowship at Amon Hen. Frodo and Sam have left the others, and an Orc attack is causing confusion with the remaining members.As much as I enjoyed the movies which were based on these books, they are simply do not capture significant pieces of the story. Wonderful characters are lost, as are nuances and events which are simply cut out. Some things are changed in the movies, perhaps to make them easier to follow, so while I can certainly understand why one might enjoy the films, I would suggest that you do not deprive yourself of the opportunity to enjoy the books and the original story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tolkien was a professor of some sort, and it shows. When I was a lad, we had to read some dreary British novel, in high school, Silas Marner, or something like that. They stretched reading it out to a very boring entire school term. It was torture, and I like to read. I slogged through this book joyfully in high school, on my own time. Why don't they have books like this in high school? There is of course far more detail than there is in the movie. This is a book assembled by a craftsman, a Kahuna- an expert- in Hawaiian terms. One can enjoy the book at a few pages per day. He has great, archetypal characters. This book set the standard. The only complaint I might make, and that is small, is that it is long- many people don't want to read something quite this long- however that is not a problem for me, I like it just as it is.

The hero has a horrible burden he has to destroy. There's a bunch of names you can't pronounce. Maybe so. But, for the record, this has to be one of the most awesome pieces of literature given to man.A hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins has his life take an unexpected turn when he inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. His friend Gandalf the wizard informs him that it is the One Ring, creation of the Dark Lord Sauron, and Sauron wants it back. If he reclaims it, he will have all the power he needs to destroy Middle Earth. The ring must be destroyed. And a fellowship of many brave friends assembles to do just that.Tolkien is a master writer. Just to give a sense of it, I used to hate poetry. Then I read Lord of the Rings. And now I love it. I took away so many lessons from this series: friendship, suffering, self-sacrifice, nobility, and yes, love as well. After all, the fellowship truly love one another, as brothers and as friends. Even now, watching the movie at the part titled \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" makes me cry.

Tolkien. The story takes place in a mysterious land by the name of Middle Earth, a land inhabited by captivating creatures such as elves, dwarves, orcs, ents and wizards, but strangest of all is the race of the hobbits. Hobbits are very docile creatures that inhabit a territory known as the Shire and tend not to stray from home, but in this story one particular hobbit known as Frodo Baggins embarks on an epic quest.To begin with a little background information will have to be given on the situation that middle-earth finds itself in. First of all an evil tyrant called Sauron has just returned and many details portend war to come. A while back Sauron had created a series of rings of power, one of which he channeled all his power into, causing it to gain control of all the others. Many years ago when Sauron was first defeated this ring was lost, and now that he has risen again it is of utmost importance to destroy the ring before it comes into the hands of the dark tyrant. Interestingly enough a very wise wizard (he is almost like a prophet at times) named Gandalf has just informed our hobbit friend, Frodo, that the ring given to him by his recently vanished uncle is the ring of power that Sauron seeks.Once Frodo is made aware of the fact that he possesses this ring of power Gandalf advises him and another hobbit loyal to Frodo, Sam, to leave the Shire immediately and travel to the House of Elrond (Elrond is a very wise elf and in his house others whom the rings business regards are present), which is quite a way off. When Sam and Frodo set off another pair of hobbits called Merry and Pippin accompany them. As the hobbits begin their journey they realize that mysterious riders that are dressed in black are following them. Later they check into an inn and meet a ranger called Aragorn, who tells them that these black riders are called Ring wraiths and have been sent by Sauron to recover the ring of power. Aragorn chooses to accompany the hobbits for security reasons, but despite this Frodo still sustains a serious injury about three-fourths of the way to the House of Elrond. Once the travelers arrive at the house of Elrond Frodo is healed and Gandalf catches up to the group. Once Frodo his regains health, discussions begin on what should be done with the ring. In the end it is decided that the ring should be destroyed and a fellowship is formed, one in which Frodo is the ring bearer. The members of this fellowship are: Gandalf, the wizard; Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin; Legolas, the elf; Boromir, the dwarf; Gimli, the dwarf; Aragorn, the ranger. Immediately after a plan of action is delineated the Fellowship proceeds to leave the house of Elrond with both the Mountain of doom (a volcano who's fire is capable of destroying the ring) and Gondor(the fortress which the dwarves need to protect).The fellowship travels for many leagues and eventually is forced to proceed by entering a dangerous underground realm called Moria. In Moria they are almost immediately pursued by goblins. These Goblins force the fellowship to travel swiftly to the exit of Moria. Once they get near the exit they need to cross a bridge but a Balrog (mythical creature of immense power) appears and blocks their way. Gandalf knows that the Balrog will be there doom so he sacrifices himself and takes the Balrog with him, allowing the Fellowship to successfully escape. Once Gandalf is gone the Fellowship decides to Proceed and eventually comes to the crossroads between Gondor and the Mountain of Doom. Here the fellowship is forced to make a decision on how to divide them, but they decide that before anything is said the ring bearer should voice his decision. Frodo then asks to be left alone for a while so that he can think, so he distances himself from the rest of his companions. While Frodo is alone Boromir comes and questions him about the ring, reaching a pint where he attacks him in order to take it away. In order to avoid any further effects of the ring on the fellowship Frodo decides to leave to the mountain of Doom on his own, but Sam forces Frodo to let him accompany him and together they escape. Finally Boromir dies trying to protect Merry and pippin from orcs, but despite his efforts the two hobbits are abducted.Now that you know the story I think it is apparent that this book is very interesting, but despite the whole book being captivating there are a few scenes, which stand out. In my opinion there is one that is especially intricate and engrossing, when Boromir attacks Frodo. In this part of the book we are able to witness the first of many negative effects that the ring of power is causing. The ring has corrupted Boromir's formerly noble mind to the point that his lust for it leads him to turn on his own companion. At one point in this scene, in reference to Boromir, the author says, \\"His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire in his eyes.\\" (pg.415) As you can see by this quote the ring was able to seize control of Boromir and twist his mind, thus creating the illusion in Boromir's mind that it was absolutely necessary for him to take control of the ring. This newfound power of manipulating minds that the ring has plays a vital role throughout the rest of the trilogy.Interestingly enough this novel is actually related to history. Many of the events and characters in the Lord of the rings trilogy (especially in the book I read, The Fellowship of the Ring) parallel various aspects of Christian history. To begin with Gandalf is a clear representation of Jesus Christ. This is evident when Gandalf dies to save his people, just as Jesus Christ did. This similarity between characters is even more evident when later in the series Gandalf resurrects. Another vary evident inclusion of Christianity in the novel is the ring of power representing the devils temptations. The ring is constantly tempting others to use it or acquire it, as can be observed when Boromir succumbs to its subtle infiltrations of his mind. Throughout the whole story Frodo himself is forced to fight off urges of wearing the ring and using its power. As you can see J.R.R. Tolkein includes many Christian ideas in this novel.This novel is a captivating tale that leaves the reader hungry for more. I especially like the way in which the author develops the power of the ring. In conclusion enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for some good fiction. If the reader likes the first novel I recommend to go ahead and read the whole trilogy and the other books associated with it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"We all know the storyline.

Tolkien has created a world so compelling, and so 'real' that the reader cannot help but be pulled into Middle Earth.The characters are engaging, the story is riveting, and the locations - Good Lord - the locations are Wonderful. Places like Lothlorien, the Old Forest, Weathertop, and of course the Mines of Moria - the ancient, sprawling dwarven kingdom that inspired Gary Gygax to create the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role playing game.If you are new to fantasy, if you don't usually go in for this kind of story, or if you are just looking for a great read, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up and find out what all the fuss is about.Let me put it this way -- there exist in the world dedicated Tolkien Scholars. How many Clancy or Koontz scholars do you think are out there?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first segment of the greatest literary masterpiece ever written, The Lord of the Rings. Lots of people call it a trilogy, but I can only agree with that idea in that the three segments were initially published seperately in the years 1954, 1955, and 1956. Besides that, one has to notice that each segment is incomplete without the others. A trilogy would contain three complete stories, like the original Star Wars trilogy. Well, its time I got on with my two cents of TFOTR. After The Hobbit was published, the fantasy genre was revived in a way that gave Arthur and his knights a run for their money. Fantasy was back, 20th century style. People begged for a sequel, and Tolkien delivered one beyond anybody's expectations and imagination. TFOTR begins to answer the questions that resulted at the end of The Hobbit. This, I feel, is its main purpose. It doesn't have as much action as the two later segments, but instead focuses on why a new quest is to begin. It does have its moments of action, but most of suspense and intrigue comes from revelations. Thats why The Hobbit should be read first. It would be a mistake not to. It is true that is somwhat slow in the beginning, but the suspense and wonder of a ruling ring just glides in the story. Suddenly, what happened with Bilbo's quest becomes very importent. It was in TFOTR that Tolkien introduced Middle-Earth and its history. A person forgets that they're reading fantasy in LOTR. It feels very real, and once TFOTR gets though the beginning, it doesn't let go. The only real bad part is that it leaves you hanging in the end, forcing you to read The Two Towers and making you wish that you had a single volume edition. I've been to Middle-Earth, and I deeply regreted having to leave for a while. Read this masterpiece (LOTR) before you die. You'll be incomplete if you don't."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Prepare yourself to delve into a world so rich, so full of life and history that you will have trouble distinguising it from something real. The Lord of the Rings is a veritable treasure. I picked up The Hobbit quite some time ago, I think I was in the 4th grade.From the moment I read the first words &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot;, I just couldn't put it down.This book does, however, lack a few things. Smut, trash, cussing, and all of the other all too common things these days. This is pure fantasy, pure enjoyment.My only wish is that I had never read it, so that I could enjoy the experience of reading it the first time again.I warn you. If you are a very busy person, and don't have much time on your hands, then don't get this book, because you'll find yourself neglecting many important things to keep reading.With charecters so vivid that it wouldn't surprise me at all if I were to run into Gandalf on the street. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'd sit down with him and blow a few smoke rings before heading in our seperate directions.My point is, this is a wonderful series . . . arguably one of the best. Buy this book, take the chance. I did, and I have no regrets."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Part one of the Lord Of the Rings Trilogy is an outstanding work of art. Tolkien uses rich and skillful words to tell his epic tale. While part one doesn't have much in the way of action, it is my favorite out of the three books. It contains a very suspenseful build up to part two, where the real action begins. Of course you wouldn't expect Part one to have as much action as Part two or three.In 'Fellowhip of the Ring' I fell in love with Frodo's faithful servant Sam. He is character to good too be true! It is Sam's personality and comments, that make him an absolute bomb. In the other books he is the bomb, but in an action stand point. The only problems with the other two books, is that you have to wait to the second half of them, to find out what has happened to Frodo and Sam.This is a must read for everyone. Of course read 'The Hobbit' first. Without reading that first, this book here can be confusing, and less fun. I wish at times that I hadn't ever read this trilogy, just so that I could read it again for the very first time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in the trilogy Lord of the Rings. This first portion of the book tells of the making and breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. The major appeal of the story stems form its rich history of the mythical world Middle Earth, and the great number of characters.The Fellowship of the Ring tells of a little known race of beings called halflings, or as they like to all themselves Hobbits, who's peaceful and fun loving way of life is being threatened to the brink of total destruction as well as pure and utter chaos. None in the Shire,the secluded home of the Hobbits, know of this emanate danger which is rapidly approaching except one small Hobbit named Frodo. Fore he possesses a magical ring of immense power. A power which is sought after by the dark lord of Mordor and his nine black riders; who will stop at nothing and go to any lengths to obtain the One Ring. Frodo's ring.With the help and guidance of Gandalf the gray,a powerful wizard and a well respected member of the Great Council, Frodo resolves to travel to the ancient land of Mordor to unmake the One Ring of the Dark Lord, by casting it into the firy mouth of Mount Doom. Although the journey may prove parlous or even fatal Frodo and three of his closest friend begin their journey toward Mount Doom, which will that them more than a year fromstart to finish.I could go on for several dozen pages, how ever I would hate to destroy the great pleasure I found in reading and discovering the deep and rich history of Middle Earth. The best aspect of the Fellowship of the Ring is I never tier of reading it. I have spent many a nights reading well into the early hours of the dawn when I suddenly realize that thoughs \\"just five more minutes\\" have turned into just five more hours. And even then I will say to myself \\"just five more minutes."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Rob Inglis's reading of Tolkien's work is brilliant. He evokes the spirit of the book through the very timbre of his voice. Even if you do not usually like to listen to recorded books, I believe this recording will draw you into the story and keep you spellbound. Every time I listen to Inglis's recordings of The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit (he has recorded them all), I feel as if he is spinning out the tale for the first time.Listening to a book helps me pick up details I miss when reading (sometimes being a fast reader is not a good thing). Inglis's narration and characterization have helped me understand the plot and characters better. In particular, he gives delightful and moving readings of the poetry--the stories within the story of Frodo's adventure. He sometimes chants, sometimes sings the tales of the ancient heroes of Middle Earth.Do not miss the opportunity to hear the best reading of Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Lord of the Rings is truly monumental fiction. I've read fantasy from many, many different authors, including Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, Stephen R. Donaldson, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, to name only a few, and I have come to the conclusion that every fantasy author in the last fifty years has borrowed from Tolkein to one extent or another.The basic plot of the book is fairly simple. Frodo Baggins is a hobbit who inherits a Ring of Power form his uncle Bilbo Baggins. At first glance, the Ring seems to be a good thing, posessing the power to turn its wearer invisible (a power which saved uncle Bilbo several times during his own adventure, chronicled in The Hobbit). However, the wizard Gandalf learns that the Ring is in fact the One Ring, created millenia ago by the evil Dark Lord Sauron, and removed from his posession by thr forces of good. Sauron was weakened by his loss, but now he has recovered strength and wants his Ring back. Once he gets it, he will have the power to conquer the world. The only way to keep the Ring from his grasp is to destroy it, and this can only be done by casting the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally created. Naturally, Mount Doom lies in the very heart of Sauron's realm in Mordor, so the quest is fraught with peril. Frodo and his faithful servant Sam, along with others, take on the task of the destruction of the Ring and the salvation of Middle-Earth. Fellowship of the Ring chronicles the first part of this story, which concludes with The Two Towers and Return of the King.If that was all there was to this book, it would be mo more than a first-rate work of fantasy. But, what lifts this book out of the realm of &quot;fantasy&quot; and into the realm of classic literature is the backstory. Lord of the Rings is essentially the conclusion of an incredible mythology that stretches back for over 7,000 Years of the Sun, and for who knows how many millenia before that. Tolkein worked on this mythology for several decades before Lord of the Rings was published, and references to it are sprinkled liberally throughout. The language and songs of the Elves are the best example of this, but there are many others.The pace of the book does slow a little in places, but that is only becuase several long expository sections are essential to give the reader the full story behind the Ring and how it made its journey from the hand of Sauron to the posession of Frodo. But, the book nevertheless has the power to draw you in. I've read this book over 20 times since I first discovered it in the early 1980's, and I still have not gotten tired of the wonder of this book.I do want to make one comment on the latest version of the book, however. I've noticed that many people have criticized the maps in the book as too difficult to read. I've looked at some of the newer copies, and I have to agree with this. I would like to point out that the map in these new copies is NOT the original map drawn by Tolkein himself, nor is it the revised map drawn by his son. The older maps are much better drawn, though the text is a little small. Frankly, if the new maps (drawn by Shelly Shapiro) bother you, I would suggest that you prowl through a local used bookstore and pick up an older copy of the trilogy, preferably the beautifully done Ballantine paperbacks of the early-to-mid 1980's. In addition to much better maps, the cover art on those books is beautiful. The one-volume red hardback version is also very nice, and you should be able to find a nice copy of it new.Books like the Harry Potter series are OK. They are light and enjoyable reading, but 100 years from now, they will be forgotten. Not The Lord of the Rings. It's a major classic of English literature, and it is THE classic of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What can I say that has not already been said? (except in the bad reviews) Tolkien has changed my perspective on life. I may be an evangelical Christian (Tolkien was Catholic) but I find his books full of great Christian insights. And besides that, his books are AMAZING.The descriptions: full, deep, beautiful. Rich with variety, color, and realism. I stand on the rocky crags of the Emyn Muil. I hear the ever-changing music of the Falls of Nimrodel. I see the breathtaking majesty of Minas Tirith. And I shudder under the menacing glare of the Dark Tower of Mordor. I have read this book countless times, and I am still moved by it.The characters: Rich, touching, real. I cry for Frodo and empathize with Sam. I cheer on Gandalf when he rides on the Pellennor Fields. I gasp as Eowyn removes her helmet, revealing her identity and defieing the Nazgul. I laugh at Butterbur puzzling over the thought of Strider as a King. Even the secondary characters seem to have lives and histories of their own. These are people I know.Last, the plot: Oh-h-h-h. &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; still scares me half to death. &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot; makes me want to slap that evil wizard. &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; still takes my breath away.I swear: Tolkien did not make this up.

Tolkien writes that the story he began in The Hobbit &#34;grew in the telling&#34; as it metamorphosed into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I've found that The Fellowship of the Ring grows in depth and breadth each time I read it. I must confess that, after seeing Peter Jackson's movies of The Lord of the Rings, I needed to take a break from reading to let Jackson's images clear out. Having done that, my recent re-reading of The Fellowship of the Ring has been a wonderful experience.

A simple book as it was, it became the stepping stone to probably one of the greatest writings of all time. The Hobbit was my favorite book, and two years later, the memory of Middle-earth and all its splendor came to me, again. I decided to pick up The Lord of the Rings, a story much more in depth than The Hobbit, much more dark and mysterious than a simple journey to the East to retrieve a dragon's loot. It tells of an Evil coming over the magical land of Middle-earth, and a simple hobbit's quest to destory the One Ring that could save them all. It is but a simple, unadorned ring, just as this story is a short, simple story, and yet underneath the surface, it is much more than what it seems to be.When you read The Lord of the Rings, you are drawn into the mystical land that J.R.R. Tolkien, a genius way ahead of his time, drew from the imagination of all those who dare to imagine. You will find yourself reading on, flipping the page and wondering what you are about to stumble upon next. It was not at all a rare sight when I would be reading late into the night, with my mother begging me to go to bed, while I would be saying, &quot;One more page, okay?&quot; You will not be able to stop!Tolkien's work is sheer poetry; not &quot;boring&quot; at all. I find myself reading hundreds of pages in only a short amount of time, as anyone who has half of a brain will. So, don't be discouraged by those who say that he is monotonous or that the writing is slow-moving. I don't think so at all. There is much mystery and intrigue in the story; you will end up wondering whether Middle-earth exists or not, for he comes up with such a deep and rich history and so many tales of woe and tragedy, and of valor and hope. This is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"One word can describe the writing of Tolkien: excellence. Tolkien has mastered the arts of story telling, language, and writing. Nothing can be said about this book that is not of a positive nature. Tolkien has written a believable story that gives his readers an adventure too incredible for the common man. In some ways, Tolkien gives readers something for which to strive. His characters put themselves at risk to protect the freedom of the land. The characters of the book are what we all desire to be, heroes. These characters serve a higher purpose than self. People long to be heroes and guardians of justice. This book gives readers a sense of satisfaction that can only be felt in the imagination.The Fellowship of the Ring and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the greatest fictional tales ever told. I plan to read all of the books J. R. R. Tolkien. I would recommend a Tolkien book to anybody who is creative and open minded. I would also recommend reading The Hobbit, prelude to the Lord of the Rings, and then moving into the trilogy. These books offer so much to the open-minded reader. Satisfaction, adventure, and an all around incredible story are just a few things Tolkien has given to so many readers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy! It's one of those classics where you can just keep on reading on and on and you don't want to finish. Yes, this book just captivated me with the adventure, suspense, excitement, and humor.&quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; is the first book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Hobbit Frodo Baggins, the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins (read J.R.R. Tolkiens prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) is visited by the wizard Gandalf. When Bilbo had left years ago he had left his magical and mystical Ring which he had taken from Gollum in his earlier adventures to Frodo. From Gandalf Frodo learns that this Ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themLost for centures, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron, he would be enabled to destory everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry travel to the Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Elrond on what to do with the ring. There he finds out that he must destroy the Ring and to do that, must cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood, Boromir a man of Gondor, and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains. Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them.But the story doesn't end here. If you have never read the books and you want to try it out, I suggest that you get all three books, not just the first one because this. If you like it, I assure you that you will be in agony at the end to find out what happens. The books are very addictive and it's very hard to stop at just &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;. Have &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; on hand.My favorite character has got to be the Elf, Legolas. Elves have always fascinated me, for their mysterious, quiet, and almost immortal ways. I love it also how Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf in this book are sort of unfriendly towards each other since Elves and Dwarves usually do not get along. But towards the end of this book and the rest of the trilogy, they're the greatest of friends and inseparable.Another good character is Pippin the hobbit with his bright and cheerful ways. One of the youngest of the group of hobbits, he is always in a positive mood but somehow manages to get in trouble often.All of the books in the trilogy are must reads. Also the prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, should also be read to understand the events which had happened before the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Though it is written mostly for adults, I'm sure teenagers wil also love it, though younger kids might not be able to understand it.

But his writing is not -- to me -- particularly interesting. There are far too many topographical passages, along the lines of &quot;Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys.&quot; And then there are the historical passages: &quot;Under [the mountains] lies Khazad-dum, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit...Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundudshathur...between their arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimril Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.&quot; And on and on and on.

Do we need it? Probably not. However, I would like to say that, if you are new to Tolkien's work and are thinking about reading The Lord of the Rings because of the impending movie then I can say that The Fellowship of the Ring is the easiest of the three books to read that make up the trilogy. The film that is to be released in December is this part of the story, with the other 2 films (The Two Towers and The Return of the King) to be made next year and the year after. The Fellowship of the Ring is such a good book to read. It is full of innocence, magic, terror and wonder. Tolkien conjurs this world of loveable Hobbits and ultimate, brooding evil. In this, the first book, you get a real insight into hobbit life and the beginnings of the adventures that Frodo makes to destroy the one ring. The other two books are great, of course, but the story gets more political and I feel they demand much more from the reader, especially The Return of the King. If you want to dabble in a bit of fantasy literature, then you can do no better than this book. I know people go on and on about The Lord of the Rings but there is a reason for that and I feel a newcomer with an open mind to this genre will be even more rewarded when reading these stories than a hardened fantasy buff. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It is quite difficult to review a book which is generally acknowledged as a masterpiece; there is the danger of merely repeating the praises heaped on the book by earlier reviewers, and there is also the difficulty of doing justice to the book's greatness. Fortunately, the release of Peter Jackson's excellent film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" gives me a fresh perspective from which to review J.R.R. Tolkien's novel.If you enjoyed the movie, you should read the book, which you will almost certainly also enjoy, even if in a different way. One of the glories of Jackson's film is its great richness and depth, the feeling it gives the viewer of stepping into an unfamiliar but real world with a long history. The reason Jackson's film is able to produce this effect is that the world in which it takes place had already been created, and imagined in almost unbelievable detail, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Far more even than the movie, Tolkien's book lets the reader share the hobbits' experience of wandering out of their doors into a world with a detailed and believable history, a multitude of different mortal and immortal races with distinct cultures and languages, and a well-defined geography (maps are included in the book). I must place special emphasis on the linguistic depth of Tolkien's world: Tolkien, a distinguished philologist, invented around fifteen languages for the inhabitants of his imaginary world to speak. (The \\"Star Trek\\" Universe, by contrast, contains only one language, Klingon, which has been devised in any detail.)Moreover, as with any cinematic adaptation of a work of literature, Jackson's movie leaves out characters, events and scenes from the book. These elements are waiting in Tolkien's text for fans of the movie to discover them. In particular, the chapters involving a character named Tom Bombadil are among the best parts of the book, although they had to be left out of the movie to keep it down to a reasonable length.Anyone who has not yet seen the movie should certainly read the book first; it's best if you imagine the characters and events of the book yourself and then compare your visions to the movie version.Like the movie, Tolkien's book is often astonishingly relevant to our post-September 11 world. The film's exchange between Frodo and Gandalf in which Frodo wishes the Shadow of evil had not arisen in his time comes directly from the book, which also contains a few other moments that resonate strongly with the current world situation. Tolkien was writing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" during World War II, but he did not intend it as an allegory of that war or of any other specific situation; rather, he hoped that readers would feel free to find his work applicable to any scenario they might see reflected in it.\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is, in fact, not a novel, but the first volume of the three-part novel \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Anyone who reads the book and sees the movie of \\"Fellowship\\" will surely want to read the two subsequent volumes, \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King,\\" to find out what happens to the characters without having to wait for the release of the two subsequent movies at Christmas in 2002 and 2003."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I'd been a fantasy binge as of late and decided to pick up the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy since the movie is due out soon. Why did I wait so long to read this? Actually I can remember starting this book at an earlier time but I got bogged down in the detail. This time through the detail didn't stop me and I screamed through it. Tolkien has woven together a very intricate adventure with characters that are both likable and believable(in the sense that they have flaws as well as attributes) in land that you can easily visualize. When I was finished I ran out right away and purchased the second installment and hope to start it shortly. I would recommend this book to anyone....even if you aren't a fantasy fan, because you soon will be. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is the fact that there were a few sections where the action seemed to slow down, but theses sectoins were short and easy to read through."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"After reading this book, I was surprised to see that so many of the reviews here were written by young people. Naturally fantasy tends to be very popular with young adults (it was with me), but Tolkien's work seems to transcend demographics. This is not a book for escapists nor for those who prefer a reality that is in opposition to our own. This is a book for those who desire to understand reality and look for magic in the process of discovery. Tolkien uses human traits and physical realities to create a world of complicated and mysterious morality - a world where a wizard Gandalf the Grey is somehow more pure than his colleague, Saruman the White.People are rarely what they appear to be and neither are hobbits. Frodo Baggins, the protagonist hobbit, is the ring bearer. He like many human heros in other books carries an unasked and heavy burden. He does not carry it with a saint's gracious self-immolation, but rather with a determination to do what he thinks is right for himself and those who depend on him. Like anyone in a situation like this, he desires to cast his burden off, but gathers the courage to continue. The admirable thing about Tolkien is that Frodo does not make these decisions based on some blind fervor for an unattainable ideal, but rather through a series of inductive steps. In this way Frodo transforms the ideal of saintliness into syllogism.Frodo would prefer to kick back with a pint of ale beneath a tree, but he doesn't. Through logic and reason, he determines that unless he begins his perilous journey and defeats the great evil spreading across the land, neither he nor anyone else will ever be able to see simple joy again.It is a story about magic of course, but the magic serves as an ideal that the realists strive to protect, not worship. They are rooted in reality, as is this tale. All fantasy writers since Tolkien owe a great deal to the style and imagination of this writer, but the greatest gift he gave them was the gift of realist fantasy. Rest assured that Tolkien is not simply the progenitor of a generation of better writers. He is a master among masters."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I guess a little over two years ago I saw the Fellowship movie, and I was blown away and went out the next day to buy the boxed set...I mean, if the movie was that good, the book must be ten times better right? WRONG! The Hobbit was pretty decent; I finished that in a few days. Then I started Fellowship. After 150 pages I couldn't take it anymore! I put it back in the box and forgot about it. I made a second attempt a year later, but only made it to page 50. I am now on my third attempt and I am GOING to finish it this time because it's driving me MAD.Now, it's not that it's not a good story. I respect Tolkien for his imagination and creativity. You can tell that he put his whole soul into this book and you can't bash someone's soul (reason for the 3 stars...), but clearly, not everybody's souls match up, so to speak. Personally, I like to feel a certain degree of empathy for characters in a story. I don't care how many leaves the 52nd tree to the north has, but I would like care about the characters. This book leaves you identifying more with topography and three page long descriptions of sunsets and such than with the characters. And I don't understand what the deal with the songs are. I hope they aren't that important because I just skip them. Derry dol, Merry dol, who cares? Jeez.Obviously, there are people who like this book, and if you're the type of person who likes to be given vast descriptions of things for the neurons in your brain to construct, then you should get this. Maybe you will even feel something for the characters. Everyone's different, otherwise this book would be as beloved as it is. If you would rather read something that moves you and stirs empathy, then go for something else.I haven't said anything new, but I need to suggestion this: I made assumptions and wasted $30 on a boxed set that I will probably never finish. PLEASE don't buy the boxed set! Just buy the first book to see if you like it, and then if you don't, you won't feel OBLIGED to read them like I do. (I guess I just have OCD or something. LOL I feel like I can't buy any other books til I read these.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Frodo Baggins was a simple Hobbit with a normal life, until he was chosen to be the heir of Bilbo, a Hobbit with a long history, and inherits an evil ring that will send him on a quest that was started long ago. On his quest he faces many dangers and meets many friends that accompany him, including an old wizard named Gandalf who seems to have started the whole quest; Sam and Merry, two Hobbits with very little taste for adventure; Strider, a Ranger with an Elven lineage, and many more people whom he befriends. During the entire journey he travels out of the boundaries of his home, the Shire, and ends up in cursed forests, abondoned Orc camps, great Dwarven and Elven cities, and a dark kingdom where he must destroy the ring which could give the dark prince the power to bring all the other rings of power together and rule Middle-Earth, destroying all good with in it.This book is for only the most serious fantasy and adventure fans because you must understand a lot about fantasies, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and Wizards. This book is the first in a three-part story that will leave you wanting to know what the author has in store for our heroes."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I loved the book called \\"Lord of the rings\\", because their is a lot of action and fighting, and not a whole lot of ROMANCE like other books. I also like the old style of military like archers and swordsman, and that is another reason why i love this book! It is also kind of spooky, and I love horror films.The best part of the book is when they started to climb the mountain and that one wizard started pusing rocks on them, and they started to fight with the enemy's. That was probably the best action scene in the book.I think conflict and characters are the most important. conflict is the most important one because that is what the whole book is about. You need to have characters otherwise who will be in the story?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Unfortunately, I have not read the books and don't have time to. I have just recently started listening to audio books on my long commute. This unabridged version has to be the next best thing to actually reading it. The reader has a good range in his voice to distinguish different characters and it never sounds dry or dull. The story really draws you in and seems so real that you want more. I wanted to listen to this before I see the movie, which I'm going to do this weekend because I'm almost finished. There is no doubt that I will be buying the next audio book next week so I can continue the story. This is very entertaining all the way through the 20 hours of listening and I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"After nearly ten years of people telling me I *had* to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy I broke down and finally did so. Having read The Hobbit in high school I thought I knew what to expect from Tolkien's trilogy. I was very wrong. The world he creates here is richer and more fully realised than the Middle-earth of The Hobbit. This, unlike The Hobbit, is a story on an epic scale and Tolkien never lets you forget that.As the first novel in the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, obviously, must set the stage for the next two novels. That means a lot of back story and that many characters and themes need to be introduced. It also means that it doesn't wrap things up in a neat little bow when you reach the last page. This bothers people for some reason.Some other reviewers here have said that Fellowship is boring. While I would agree that there are slow spots in Fellowship, I would never call it boring. The bits of the story you learn from Gandalf's meeting with Frodo in the Shire or the Council of Elrond are important much later and Tolkien needs to bring them in when he does. Even the journey to Rivendell (what I thought to be a rather slow bit) introduces a good many characters. The pay-off for the dull parts come in the sections dealing with the Mines of Moria and the journey down the river from Lorien. Tolkien is a master storyteller and he does not waste a single word.If you've enjoy reading works on an epic scale (The Odyssey, Beowulf) then you'll enjoy Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tolkien's &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy literally created the genre of heroic fantasy, spawning works as diverse as those written by Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel Delany, Terry Brooks, and of course, even J. K. Rowling's &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. You can also hear echoes of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; in both the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, and especially, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (Indeed J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; has often acknowledged his debt to Tolkien.). Yet it stands head and shoulders above them all as an epic tale of friendship, devotion, and faith as a motley crew of heroes valiantly try to stop the evil Sauron from conquering all of Middle-earth. In &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;, Frodo Baggins undertakes a perilous journey as the Ring bearer, the keeper of Sauron's one ring of power, without which the dark lord can not hope to conquer all of Middle-earth. Frodo is joined in his quest by such noble figures as the Human ranger Strider (later revealed as Aragorn, the last surviving descendant of a legendary lineage of kings), the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the wizard Gandalf, Frodo's kinsmen Merry and Pippin, and his ever faithful friend Samwise Gamgee.Much to my amazement, Peter Jackson's filmed adaptation of &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; remains remarkably quite faithful to the text, though compressing some details for dramatic license, and omitting the important character of Tom Bombadil. Indeed, the film ends at the very opening of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the next installment of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;, with the fellowship dispersed and with Boromir, another of the humans, dead. If you haven't read Tolkein's epic before, you're in for a veritable literary feast after seeing Jackson's elegant adaptation (One of the finest filmed adaptations of a literary work I've seen in a long, long time.). However, I'd recommend reading this splendid work first before viewing Jackson's cinematic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien took forever to write this book, but I think both he and I would have been saved a lot of time if he just cut down his lenghthy descriptions and stuck to the plot. The ridiculous songs, included to add an ancient, mysterious tone to the book, really don't contribute to the book's success, nor do the historical ramblings or repetitive descriptions of the characters' surroundings.Yes, yes, I know some nut who's so caught up in fantasy that he dresses like a hobbit himself will no doubt criticize my review, stating that the descriptions and songs and countless pages of dribble make the story SO REAL and it's the alternate reality that makes this story a masterpiece. But for those of us still living on planet earth, it's just a bit too much to have to deal with the long-winded, unnecessary parts of this book.BUT, the plot is excellent, and that's what kept me reading. Although not as exciting as The Hobbit (a superior book in my opinion), the great storyline and exciting turn of events were enough for me to call this book a good one. I will read the other books in the trilogy, now knowing what to expect.I do recommend this book, but just realize what you're in for. If you have the patience, it's worth your time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"OK-first I've got to confess that I avoided &quot;Ring&quot; geeks in high school-they were way too passionate (zealots?). Over the years, I've resisted and when I finally read and loved &quot;The Hobbit&quot; I decided to read &quot;Fellowship&quot; a year ago. Since then I put it down twice, getting bogged down in the lengthy history of Middle Earth that precedes the actual story. Once I decided to skip it altogether, things built speed rapidly and I ended up really enjoying the book.Since many will consider reading this based on seeing the film, I'll add that I saw the movie and was blown away by how well the filmmakers told the story, leaving out the parts that are nice but superfluous, and keeping the core intact. That said, the book makes more clear the monumental task of gathering opposing forces against a common enemy and shows why the choices characters make (the elf-queen, for instance) are not as simple as they appear in the film.I also realized how thoroughly George Lucas &quot;borrowed&quot; from &quot;Rings&quot; in the first 3 Star Wars movies..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I debated whether or not to write a review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I mean, there really isn't a whole lot more that I can say that hasn't been said already. However, I decided to go ahead and add another two cents worth.THE LORD OF THE RINGS is my favorite novel of all time. It's a shame that all the books weren't printed together as one when they were first published; one has to discuss each part of the series separately. Anyway, Tolkien's novel (of which this is the first part) is the granddaddy of all fantasy and science fiction. Before Tolkien came along, there really wasn't much in the realm of fantasy fiction or even science fiction. It took a master of language to write an extended sequel to a children's story he once wrote to enliven the genre. For the fact alone, Tolkien's work will remain as a classic and endure for ages to come.Yet, there is more to it than that. Tolkien's masterpiece is more than something that started a new genre. It is a great story, one of the best, culminated from many great stories of the past (Shakespeare, Norse mythology, Chaucer, etc.) and imbedded in the morals of Tolkien's Christian faith. It is a story that all men long to live. It is a tale about life. It's about friendship. It's a story about death, redemption, and salvation; a tale of good triumphing over evil. Combining all those elements (and so many others) into one story is a great feat. So, here's to Tolkien and THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Long may it endure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I see many reviewers giving low ratings and was disappointed. For one, it shows how little people care for details and setting these days. The main reason the details are there in the first place is because it is a different world with a different history. The characters were fine the way they were, unless you wanted another 200 pages of &quot;tedious&quot; reading.I think there are people who should stick with MTV and the WWF for entertainment and there are others who can handle something more involving. If you are the latter and love fantasy epics then you probably have already read this trilogy, if not then I recommend getting The Hobbit first and then the non-film versions of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Well, I decided to read this book once more before going to see the movie. It would have only been twice, but I still needed to refresh my memory badly. Was I ever glad that I did! This story is so full of adventure, danger, and mystery it's not even funny. Each page opens up into a new world with things never even imagined by this reader. Reading about the dark lord Sauron sent chills down my spine because this is one of the most evil characters ever created. I can't believe some people say the characters are one dimensional! Every single character has their own distinct personality, and by the end I had grown to love them all.Unfortunately I wound up in the climax during finals week. I couldn't get any studying done because I couldn't put this amazing book down! If you pick up this book and find the first 100 pages or so slow, keep reading...it really starts to pick up. Read this...60 years later it can still thrill, amaze, delight, and even sometimes, cause a laugh. In case you don't know, the story is about a fellowship of hobbits, humans, and other creatures who must take the one ring to be destroyed in the one place where it can be destroyed: In the middle of evil Sauron's vast land. If Sauron got ahold of it, he would be able to rule all of middle earth with it...and make everyone his slave...this ring is the most powerful of all rings.

If you haven't read this book, where have you been? This is where J.K. Rowling, Brian Jacques, Susan Cooper and Philip Pullman all got their inspiration.

Two maybe described as 'new school' and two as 'old school'. The newer novels are 'The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant' by Stephan Donaldson and 'The Book of the Old Sun' novels of Gene Wolfe. (The Shadow Of The Torturer, The Claw Of The Conciliator, The Sword of The Lictor and The Citadel of The Autarch). The older novels are the Gormenghast trilogy of Mervyn Peake and of course J.R.R.Tolkein's 'The Lord Of The Rings' of which 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' is the first book. All of the books I have quoted have one thing in common and that is an astonishing depth of characterization and the invocation of a sense of a whole, new, fully consistent and fully realized place. These novels draw you in, you believe the places are real, you believe in their independent existence 'out there' somewhere. Once you read any of these books, the characters are with you forever. Thomas Covenant and Linden Avery, Titus, Flay and Steerpike, Severian and Dorcas and of course Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pipin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, Arwen, Faramir, Boromir, King Theoden, Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron, Gollum, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Galadriel, Eomer, Eowyn etc etc. I can read these novels now just for the chill I get at certain passages.... &quot;And they hewed Hama's body before the gates of the Hornburg after he was dead&quot; as King Theoden says to Saruman.

Who is you're hero, what makes the hero great. This is the grandaddy of all modern fantasy fiction. If you have read any of this genre and were put off, remember..all others are pale shadows...shadows of shadows of this truely remarkable and living book. It has it all, love, war, magic, sorrow, pain and truth. It has such a depth of story telling that even on the second or third read through, you will find more significance than the last. And the poetry, just read it aloud, read the songs. Many fantasy writers (and straight fiction writers as well) have tried the pen of the poet in thier prose, and failed, Tolkien did not .Tolkien wrote something subtle and beautiful in these books.

I don't like the elves leaving Middle Eatrth because they could play a bigger part in the story than they do.My favorite character is Aragorn, because he is humble, yet kingly & strong. My favorite paragraph in the book is where Bilbo talks about Aragorn's hidden strength because it describes the respect some show him. This is what he says, \\"all that is gold does not glitter, not all who wander are lost, the old that is strong dois not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost, from the ashes a fire shall be woken, a light from the shadows shall spring; renewed shall be the blade that was broken, cronless again shall be king. It's a great read & all three books (The Fellowship of the Ring, The two Towers, & The return of the king) are worth the time, but I would like to know why the Elves fly from the Eastern Evil & why most Hobbits are so ignorant.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I loved these books from the moment I read them because I believe that they are great fantasy books. I understand that the characters don't have flaws and you can't relate to them, but I think these books are still wonderful. Every fantasy book that I have ever read, which is a lot, I haven't ever really been able to relate to. That is what a fantasy book is about, it's not about emotions most of the time. I agree also that it gets boring at times, but I think most books do that. I found it so amazing that Tolkien had made up his own laguages and put so much effort into this outstanding world of fantasy. I have never read another fantasy book where you can tell how much effort has gone into it. I would not recommend seeing the movies first because you get so much more out of the books than you do the movies. If you see the movie first then you will not understand the books as much."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I liked this book very much. The story starts out in a cozy little place called the Shire. There lived Bilbo Baggins, an extremely wealthy hobbit who was quite well known for his adventures. He acquired his wealth from an adventure in which he fought trolls, goblins, giant spiders and even a mighty dragon.He planned a huge party for his 111th birthday. During his speech, he makes an unexpected surprise in which he slips on a magic ring and disappears. While invisible, he headed back to Bag End, his house, to say farewell to Gandalf, an old wizard and friend. Bilbo left everything to Frodo, even his ring, however with an odd sense of reluctance. He then left on a permanent and secret vacation.Gandalf soon discovered the cause of Bilbo's reluctance to leave the ring behind for Frodo. It was created by Sauron, an evil sorcerer with one goal, to conquer all of Middle Earth. He seeks the Ring and it wishes to be found by him. Should he get it, all of Middle Earth would lie within Sauron's grasp. As long as it remains hidden, there is a risk he shall find it. It also can only be destroyed in the heart of his empire where it was created, deep within the fires of Mount Doom.Frodo and his gardener, Sam Gamgee, set out on a journey to Rivendale with the Ring to decide what should be done with it. It is a long and perilous journey. Sauron's spies are everywhere. To make matters worse, they are pursued by hideous Black Riders, armored zombies-like creatures on horses whose only mission is to get the Ring - at all costs! All hope for Middle Earth lies in two hobbits. Will Frodo and Sam successfully make their journey to Rivendale, or will Sauron prevail?I liked this book quite a bit. It has such a realistic plot line you could believe that it really happened. The idea with the Ring of Power, Sauron, hobbits, dwarves, elves and goblins was incredibly creative. J.R.R. Tolkien must have had quite an imagination to make this story and I look forward to reading his other books as well.I also loved how much detail he gave the characters. They seem so real and you can really see the book from Frodo's point of view even though it's not in first person. In most parts, such as the mines of Moria, the book was riveting. However, in other parts, such as the forest of Lothlorien or the House of Tom Bombadil, it loses its grip.I would recommend this book to people 12 and up. The only factor to that is it's just so complicated. Even I found it hard to understand every now and then. It's a great story anyway and I loved it. I give J.R.R.

Gandalf eventually figures out it is the One Ring of Sauron, and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin leave the shire. Through many perils they reach the Prancing Pony Inn, and meet Strider (aka Aragorn, son of Arathorn). From here, the story becomes truly exciting, with a fight with the black riders, and a flight to Rivendell.

The Fellowship of the ring is the first part. Within its numerous pages, you will find all the questions, and some of the answers (of the questions) posed to you over the course of your life. The story follows the quest of Frodo Baggins, who has been entrusted with the ring of power, which he must destroy, for if the enemy regains it, the world of good will come to an end. With only a few companions, he sets out to complete an impossible, quest, will little hope of either success, of survival. the only thing that keeps him going is his love for his people, and the knowledge that the world's fate is in his hands. The moral issues, questions of greed, and wants, and fortune which arise, are some of the deepest you will find in fantasy stories. A master of both his languages and the one in which he writes, Tolkien masters emotions, fate, a world picture, and characters which do not even need to be explained for the reader to be able to relate to them. There is a magic in the work of good writers which allows one to get totally indulged in the characters, their problems, and their emotions. Tolkien is a master of that magic.I the year 2001, NewLine Cinema released to the public a cinematic take-off on the Lord of the Rings. According to the producers it was a movie which was intended to stay as \\"Faithful to the book\\" as possible. It was a movie which should have never been made. Although it is a masterpiece of a film, with excellent actors, and phenomenal landscape and music, it lost most, if not ALL of the magic inherent of the book series. A true reader of literature, and moreso a faithful reader of tolkien, will not hold this film in high regards. There is no \\"Lord of the Rings: The Movie\\". This movie has no authority over the true story. Watching the movie before reading the book leaves one with little appretiation for an excellent work of art. DO NOT DO SO. If you can help it, do not watch any cinematic version at all, but instead revel in the magic, and power of the epic trilogy. Tolkien didn't write an action/adventure film, nor was he targeting the mainstream media of the early 21st century (during which, consequently, he was/is not alive.) He was, as all writers are, (speaking from experience)writing to express ideas, and feelings, and true issues. This book will take you to a world you have never been before, and give you views on life you never had. This book is not just entertainment, this book is a way of life. Please read it, and it's two sequels. And don't even think of the movie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I would strongly recommend this book to any reader that likes fantasy.

He thought it was cool to have the &quot;The One Ring&quot;. Until Gandalf (the wizard) teaches him a little bit more about the Ring and finds out it makes you grow attached to it and then corrupts you. Gandalf told Frodo to keep it secret until Gandalf returned. Gandalf returns and tells Frodo what it really meant and that it is meant to get thrown into the Cracks of Doom. Which is the only place where it can be destroyed. Out of Frodos the Cracks of Doom are in the middle of the evil kingdom Mordor where Sauron is trying to get back his power, trying to find the one Ring that Frodo has, and destroying all good. Frodo, Pippin, Merry, and Sam journey to Bree where they meet Aragorn the Ranger and eventually to Rivendell, all the while pursued by the Ringwraiths. There in Rivendell the Fellowship was more developed: Gimili the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and Borimir of Gondor joined the team. I think with this group they will be able to get the job done.J.R.R. has great writing. And once you finish the first book you want to go onto the second book.

It is fabulous."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of The Ring is the first volume in the Lord of the Rings trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien. This is one of the greatest epic fantasy books of all time! We are introduced to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins who has just discovered this one ring is no ordinary ring but a very powerful dark force. This ring was forged long ago by a very dark and powerful lord, who lost the ring and will stop at nothing to once again claim its great power and rule all of Middle Earth.I really enjoyed this book partly because Tolkien uses such vivid and lifelike detail to describe the settings and the characters. It was hard to get used to the strange names and the places, but after the first couple chapters you knew exactly what he was referring too. Then it was so easy to put yourself in the same places and feel as though you were part of the story. I especially liked the way he describes the elves and Rivendale. When he describes the Dark Riders, you can almost smell the cold, stale air coming from the nostrils of the evil horses.Also his characters were very interesting and intriguing especially Frodo because everything revolves around him and the decisions he must make. I feel as though he could have focused some more on Gandalf because he is the one who convinced Frodo to take on this task.Overall, this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, I could not put it down. I really recommend that if you have seen the movies to also read the books because they are even better than the movies."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There is, as Simon Cowell says, &quot;no question or doubt&quot; (or &quot;no question a doubt&quot;, danged if I know from his accent) that this is one of the greatest works of Western literature the world has yet seen. That was beautifully proven with the movies. Now, after reading the tedious &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and witnessing Peter Jackson's timeless adaptation, I was finally ready to pick up Part One of LOTR. I'm glad I didn't wait another second. Tolkien's first brainchild is timeless, a flawless blend of rousing adventure, memorable (and often quirky) characters, hypnotic fantasy, good vs. evil, and social commentary. If you are willing enough to read the lenghtly introduction, don't be fooled by Tolkien's explanation that this is just a book for your basic reading pleasure. It can be read on so many thematic levels it's unbelievable. There is a chapter in the book that was cut from the movie. The chapter &quot;In The House of Tom Bombadil&quot; provides a pause in the increasing tension of the novel (the hobbits have had a close encounter with death from a terrible enemy) and introduces us to Tom Bombadil and his lovely wife. In the book, the pause works, but it was best left out of the movie, where the pace was much quicker. That brings me to another point of the book: the pace. Tolkien did not write this to satisfy children. This is fantasy for those with very long attention spans. He goes into long, at times tedious, detail of what the Fellowship had for breakfast, if one of them ate more than the other, etc. And the romance between Aragorn and Arwen is not present in the book as it is in the movie. No matter. Both the movie and book are excellent and stand as perfection in their genre. Buy both immediately."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"_The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_ is an amazing adventure story of four friends and many allies who journey great distances as an attempt to preserve all life from evil forces. The main character, Frodo Baggins, exhibits outstanding courage and bears the burden of the ring, which gives its user awesome power. The ring also easily corrupts the mind of all its users. Frodo and his life long best friend Sam are determined to stick together no matter what danger they encounter. It is an excellent display of friendship, and although this is a fictional novel, the qualities exhibited by each and every character make readers feel as if the story is real and they are actually in the setting of the story.Some may say that the first part of the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy is slow and boring, but I believe the books serves a very important purpose and sets up what is yet to come in this exciting series by J.R.R.

In J.R.R Tolkien's epic novel The Fellowship of the Ring, readers are propelled into the breathtaking fantasy world of Middle Earth and introduced to young Frodo Baggins of The Shire. Throughout this spellbinding epic, readers accompany Frodo on his rugged road of hardships and dilemmas leading up to the destruction of the ring of power and the liberation of Middle Earth.Frodo Baggins was just a typical Hobbit who coexisted peacefully and quietly in his secluded environment in the Shire. He was a normal citizen who was very naive with regard to the many happenings of Middle Earth. However, Frodo's serene life was short-lived, for he soon discovered that the all mighty ring of power was in his household. This book is about how Frodo most leave behind his beloved home and set out to destroy the ring of power once and for all. Along his quest, he faces many arduous circumstances and he sometimes longs for his familiar home. Often, IR.R Tolkien makes the readers really ponder whether Frodo has enough willpower to continue his quest and if he will ever truly overcome affliction. The author does an outstanding job creating this believable yet surreal world and making you really get interested in the characters and events. In my opinion, he is one of the most innovative authors of all time.Perhaps even more alluring than the predominant storyline are the strong underling themes and messages that permeate the book. Even though this book is a fantasy, it has some extremely important messages that are universally significant. For instance, one of the most dominant themes of this book (and the whole trilogy) is the concept of small people being strong enough to overcome great adversity. At some instances, you can really see that Frodo is a brave person and that he has enough determination to overcome the malice and hatred of the enemy. Another central theme is the notion that fate intervenes with an individual's life. For instance, when the ring of power fell into the hands of Frodo, was it really misfortune or was he meant to be the destroyer of the ring and savior of Middle Earth? I found myself pondering such questions over and over again in my mind and definitely think that this added great intrigue to an already outstanding book.All in all, you can see that I enjoyed exploring Middle Earth and experiencing the many thrilling events described in this amazing piece of literature. I think that this is an essential read for anybody who is interested in fantasy stories and I strongly recommend it to everyone who has the stamina to persevere through some of the more complicated and confusing parts. This is my favorite book that I have read thus far and I believe that J.R.R Tolkien is one of the most creative and gifted authors of American literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"In the Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring, there is one ring that everyone is after.

Tolkien, author of The Fellowship of the Ring, always possessed an interest in the English language and began writing The Lord of the Rings trilogy in 1939. The story falls under the fantasy and adventure genre. The epic is set in the land of Middle Earth where Men, Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits dwell. The once weakened Dark Lord Sauron has regained much of his power and is searching for his Ring, which is the focal point of his power. Now, Frodo Baggins, a cousin of the renowned Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, has acquired the Ring of power. The first half of The Fellowship of the Ring details Frodo's flight to the Elven City of Rivendell, where the fate of the Ring will be decided. Tolkien uses an intricate setting, a unique style and strong characterization to bring this adventure to life.Perhaps the most important device Tolkien uses in his writing is setting. The first half of The Fellowship of the Ring is set in the imaginary country of Middle Earth and focuses on the Ring's journey to Rivendell. The environment plays an important role in The Fellowship of the Ring, and Tolkien spared no expense in creating a setting that could be clearly understood and visualized. To do this, Tolkien employed the use of personification. Frodo's travels through the Old Forest are a fine example of Tolkien's personification. \\"But after a while the air became hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them.\\" (123). Tolkien uses personification of the environment so well that the environment almost becomes a character in the story. The lifelike descriptions aid in making this story so real. Tolkien's style in this novel is noticeably different from other novels.One characteristic of his style is Tolkien's use of songs that are found throughout, and play an important role in his writing. Using songs, Tolkien is able to express feelings and relieve tension in suspenseful situations. The songs are also used to give the reader glimpses of the history of Middle Earth. For example, Strider sings a song of the old days to the Hobbits on their journey to Rivendell. \\"\`I will tell you the tale of Tinuviel,' said Strider, \`in brief-for it is a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old.'\\"(203). This allows Tolkien to depict his imagined world without slowing the pace of the book. The reader gains knowledge of the world of Middle Earth that gives them a stronger connection with the story. Songs also server the purpose of giving readers insight into the characters of The Fellowship of the Ring.Tolkien develops Frodo from a young carefree hobbit to a hobbit encumbered with the burden of bearing the Ring of Power. As Frodo journeys towards Rivendell, he encounters challenges with other characters. These conflicts make the story suspenseful and create stronger bonds with his companions.Once Frodo reaches Rivendell, he will go towards Mordor on a quest to destroy the Ring. Tolkien's adventure does not bore and it only gets more exciting. The end is a cliffhanger and urges one to jump immediately to the next installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I am tingling in anticipation to read what happens in The Two Towers (the second volume). I recommend this novel to any that seek a change in their life and want to escape to a wonderful world of mystery, honor, and adventure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"\\"Three Rings for the Elven-Kings under the SkySeven for the Dwarf-Lord in their halls of stone,Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord, upon his dark throne,in the land of Mordor where shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themin the land of Mordor where shadows lie.\\"And that is the summary of the tale of Sauron, Lord of the Rings, who sought to rule the Land of Middle Earth until his defeat.

Tolkein, the task of taking the Ruling Ring to the pits of Mount Doom in the treacherous lands of Mordor and the fate of Middle Earth is placed in the hands of the brave hobbit, Frodo. This burden is also held by the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship consists of the cunning and fearless ranger, Aragon, the skilled elven marksman, Legolas, the stout dwarf, Gimli, the wise wizard, Gandalf, the headstrong heir of Gondor, Boromir, and the three friends Pippin, Merry, and Samwise. All of them agree to helping the young hobbit accomplish the task. They are beset by many setbacks. They find that Gandalf&#65533;s friend, Saruman, is now in alliance with the forces of Sauron. After fleeing from Saruman&#65533;s forces in their encounter in the Mines of Moria,Gandalf sacrifices himself to the demon, the Balrog. They continue their journey disheartened by the loss of their dear friend. The Fellowship is attacked by an army of orcs, the twisted servants of Saruman. Boromir, like his human ancestors before him, is seduced by the power of the ring and tries to seize the ring from Frodo. Realizing his faults he decides to face the Orcs in a last act of redemption. He tries to allow the others to get away. By blowing the Horn of Gondor he gets the attention of all the orcs in the area. He dies a heroic death fighting the Orcs. Still, his efforts fail and the hobbits Merry and Pippin are taken captive by the Orcs. Legolas, Aragon, and Gimli head for Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, in hopes of overtaking the Orcs. Frodo and Samwise head for Mordor to continue their quest.I think that the Fellowship of the Rings is a well written novel and I think that it is a must read. In this novel, Tolkein illustrates an adventure of magic and thrills enough to keep you satisfied till the end.

Our charachters begin thier great adventure. This book has a more lighthearted feel than the latter two books because the fullness of what they are really up against has not been revealed. Still, there is heartbreak and tragedy on the road, but we know this is only the beginning."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"If you have seen the movie, Lord of the Rings, and you think that you don't need to read the book because it won't have anymore that the movie, than your wrong! The book has so much more than the movie and also some different details. I recommend this book to anyone that likes fantasy or magic.In the book three hobbits leave the Shrie, not two like in the movie. Black Riders are drawn to Frodo (the main character) because he has a ring, and not just any old ring, but a very powerful ring that they must destroy. On their journey they meet many characters that help them to avoid the Black riders and other obsticals.

It is about nine companion that set of on an adventure to destroy the one ring and rid the land of the Dark Lord Sauron. The main character, a hobbit, is Frodo Baggins and he sets out with his friend Sam, and relatives Merry and Pippin. Along with them come two men, Aragorn and Boromir, one elf named Legolas, a dwarf named Gimli, and a wizard named Gandalf. They are determined to come to the aid of Middle-Earth, the setting of this book that is based on an medieval England long forgotten. This story is told in third-person which tells of how Frodo got the ring, how he sets of with the said companions to destroy the One Ring in the land in was forged, Mordor, the land inhabited by the Dark Lord and his servants.This book is an epic masterpiece beyond question. The way that Tolkien writes mixed with the history and culture of Middle-Earth draw you in and never let go. I loved how he created such a complex history and his love for this realm he created.Another reason i loved the book was that the writing was so moving and interesting that you want to keep reading. Here is and example:To the sea, to the sea! The white gulls are crying,The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.West, west away, the round sun is falling,Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling,The voices of my people that have gone before me?I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;For our days are ending and our years failing.I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,In Eressea, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,Where the leaves fall not: land of my people foreverThere is such originality and love in the books that is hard to comprehend, but easy to love. This is why i love this book because the words and sentences you will read in there will never be forgotten by you.Another reason is because Tolkien integrates themes of honor and loyalty that make you wish the book will never end. The way he writes makes you wish you could witness the honor and loyalty portrayed throughout this book. Here is a example:\\"Come, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\\"This quote was said when Sam and Frodo were completely exhausted from the journey, they had not eaten or drank in a day but Sam carries his master, because he has not the strength, shows the loyal of unimaginable proportions. He follows his master to almost certain failure and perhaps death, but he never leaves him none the less.This is a amazing book and i rate it 5 stars because of the complicity and originality in this book that you will find no where else."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Definitely a book to read if you are an advanced reader and likes fantasy.

Unparalleled in scope and detail. Few other works of fantasy even come close to creating the mythic appeal that this novel has evoked. I believe Tolkien's work is now considered a form of mythology than a mere novel. It's characters are profoundly relevant in thought and action. While the political scheme and the places are far different than earth, the characters live like us and act like us, they come with all the quips and foibles of our character. In short Tolikien expresses this profoundly encompassing work as part metaphor, part fantasy story. This is more than a great read, as one reads it more and more, one is drawn into the world of Middle Earth, drawn into its history and its characters. This is not a novel to be read but a saga to be experienced."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them...I know a lot of people that think kids today are hopeless.

I think all the books (so far) are awesome. I've always hoped to find something like Lord of the Rings. When I read it, I get totally absorbed into the world of Middle-Earth. Sometimes people will be screaming my name into my ear and I won't hear them. I've been introducing it to my friends (most of whom have read The Hobbit already). Some of my friends on the internet, all either 11, 12, or 13, introduced it to me. I think it's great when you can relate to someone years older than you who has read the same books.

This book is also deep and very rich. The world Tolkien creates is so real and his characters are so intricate that I have to slap myself for ever thinking of Robert Jordan as the King. In Jordan's books you get the same richness of his world but not like Tolkiens. It's weird. It's like Tolkien has some special skill that becomes apart of his words. Oh yeah, and Jordan waits up to 4 years to bring out his next book. While this is insulting to the fans and shows how smug Jordan can be I can't help but appreciate the sincerity of Tolkien.

R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time. There is simply no way the whole story could be squeezed into three hours. Ralph Bakshi's attempt to do it was a total failure.With all of the truly demoniac scenes in the second and third volumes, not to mention Gandalf's heroic stand against the Balrog in the Mines of Moria, I really find the single scariest moment in the whole novel to be the one I read on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. It is no surprise that this scene is one of the most powerful in Jackson's movie. Jackson even improves on the scene by replacing the mighty warrior, Glorfindel with the very slender, delicate looking Arwen, who would seem to not have the snowball's chance in hell against the nine black riders.While almost all the scenes in \`The Two Towers' made it to the screen, important parts of both \`The Return of the King' and \`The Fellowship of the Ring' were understandably left behind when the film was done. Oddly, the single most interesting character of the volume, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the \`deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was \`the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of the Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. \`The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes. Bombadil and his soul mate Goldberry seem to be great archetypes for the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. In fact, of all the characters in \`Lord of the Rings', the contrast between Bombadil and Gandalf are two of the most interesting archetypes relevant to modern humans. I certainly have less trouble identifying with these two than with the diminutive, hairy-toed hobbits.While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more \`human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. These struggles of conscience are masterfully depicted in the films. The most important instance in this film is the struggle of Boromir between his sworn allegiance to the quest of the fellowship versus his fealty to his father, Denethor, steward of Gondor.As great as the movies are, and they are masterful in how much of Tolkien's story they got onto film, the depth of history and linguistic richness Tolkien creates simply cannot be conveyed in three hours. You got to read the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I first read the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as a pre-teen and over time my memory of the details of this story had become blurred. It was a great pleasure to return to Middle-Earth to make this epic journey again. Tolkein's attention to detail, in particular to the development of the history and backstory, pay huge dividends in making this story believable. You can't help but be drawn into this quest to save the world. Tolkein's characters are complex and even his heros don't always get along. The story is full of surprises, some of them pleasant, others, not so much. The thing that surprised me the most, upon re-reading, was the time span of this story, with large gaps in time glossed over in the telling. If anything, this helps reinforce the epic nature of this saga."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bid them. These were the words inscribed on the one ring in the black language of Mordor, the one ring that was forged by the dark lord Sauron; the ring of power is all Sauron needs to cover all of Middle Earth in eternal darkness. All that prevents Sauron from spreading his dark dominion is Frodo and his companions. Frodo was chosen to be the ring bearer and to carry the ring to the one place where it could be destroyed-Mount Doom, the very heart of Sauron's kingdom.This is the setting of the great trilogy of the Lord of the Rings written by J.R.R. Tolkien-the man who is widely acknowledged by many as the father of modern day fantasy. The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, begins on Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday. Bilbo, weary of his life in the Shire, desires to have adventures like he's had before. Before Bilbo's departure he leaves his possessions to his nephew Frodo Baggins but he is reluctant to part with his precious ring. Bilbo finally parts with the ring after the wizard Gandalf the Grey convinces him to. Several years pass and Gandalf returns to Frodo in the Shire and reveals the truth about the ring. This is when Frodo's great journey began. When Frodo eventually reaches Rivendale a counsel is called and The Fellowship is formed. Its members include Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimly, Boromir, and Gandalf. The hobbits had many powerful people to aid them but these powerful people weren't the true heroes in the story.The \\"great heroes\\" in this novel are people who are arguably least suitable for the job. The hero wasn't Aragorn, son of Arathorn, the heir to the throne of Gondor, nor was it the great wizard Gandalf the Grey, the great heroes were Hobbits. Hobbits aren't known for their greatness; they are content with their life in the Shire and care very little about the outside world. Yet, hobbits were the ones who had the fate of Middle Earth placed in their hands. Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin (Pippin) Took, and Meriodic (Merry) Brandybuck were the greatest heroes. They are by no means powerful. They don't wield magic or swords with great skill; they are just ordinary people, but their ordinary qualities are what make them great.Although Tolkien's characters are very interesting I think they could've been developed in greater detail. Much of Tolkien's rich descriptions were focused on the appearance of the landscape or the history which was involved. Very rarely, if ever, does Tolkien describe the thoughts of his characters; Tolkien writes in an omnipresent viewpoint-the reader sees the events but they don't see into the character's psychology or reasoning. The reader doesn't get to know the character on a personal level through interpreting their feelings, the motivations of a character must be interpreted through dialogue or their actions.Boromir's desire to use the ring to defeat Sauron shows how he is greedy and impulsive. He has the same traits that the Nazgul, the undead servants of Sauron, had while they were human. They desired power so they were easily deceived and corrupted.Other information can be inferred though a character's dialogue. It is evident that Gandalf has great power but the magnitude of his power is never completely apparent. A glimpse of Gandalf's true power is shown at the bridge of Khazad-dum. While the fellowship journeyed through the dark mines of Moria they encounter a Balrog-a demon of the underworld. Once they reach the bridge Gandalf confronts this demon directly and makes a definite statement, \\"You shall not pass.\\" No fear is evident in Gandalf and it was obvious that he is facing a creature of immense power, a creature powerful enough to cause hordes of orcs and goblins to flee like cowards. In spite of this Gandalf confidently stated, \\"Dark fire shall not avail you here...\\" This was a further display of his lack of fear. Gandalf's confidience gives us a glimpse of his true power. People are usually afraid of things that are greater than them; Gandalf's confidence implies that he knows that his power is on the same level if not higher than the Balrog's. It was only because Gandalf dropped his guard that the Balrog was able to pull him down as he fell.After losing Gandalf the fellowship was forced to continue on. Even after losing his great friend and mentor Frodo and the other hobbits still continued this journey while carrying his heavy burden. Through their actions Tolkien demonstrates the bond of friendship that existed between the hobbits. This is what made the hobbits great; in spite of adversity their friendship stayed true and they stayed by each other's side. Through Frodo's journey he was never truly alone; Sam had vowed to stay by his side. To me, one of the most interesting aspects of the hobbits is where their strength lied, in their friendship.Tolkien's interesting characters and intriguing story combined to make an excellent novel. My only complaint is that I wish he would've wrote about some of the other characters like Gandalf and Aragorn in greater detail but that wasn't something that Tolkien wanted to focus on. The main focus of his novel was the hobbits and the extraordinary accomplishments that came from these very ordinary people. Even though I wished that Tolkien would have given more exposure to some of his other characters, I agree that Lord of the Rings definitely deserves to be known as a classic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Having seen the movie adaptation twice, and looking forward with great eagerness to the next installment, I decided it was time to re-read the novel. I used to read it twice a year, religiously, starting from when I was in grade school---third or fourth grade, I think---and even now I pick it up at least a three or four times every decade. I can still write my name in Elf-runes...I was (and am) fascinated by Tolkien's world-building, so desperately imitated by so many neophyte fantasy writers. This world-building is a good portion of the attraction of the book, for me. It feels so complete. As a kid, I wanted so much to believe that it was true (not, at that point, being able or willing to differentiate between the truth of art-making and the truth of history). It resonates at a very deep level for me, all those Jungian archetypes and half-remembered myths. At a time when I was becoming aware (and frightened) of my own adolescent mortality, I wanted desperately to believe in the immortality of the Elves...And every time I go back to it, I am surprised all over again at how grand the story-telling is---I tend to remember the writing as beautiful but lugubrious, but Tolkien actually evokes places and personalities swiftly and skillfully.I read a lot of schlock in the early 70's which featured large ad-copy: &quot;Not since Tolkien has an author blah blah, blah...&quot; but there are very few who work satisfied me as his did (and still does). Ursula K. LeGuin. Octavia Butler, Sheri Tepper, Orson Scott Card. Sharon Shinn. Ray Bradbury when he's not overdosing on lyricism. But Tolkien is the Master, the one to go back to. I'm not as fond of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, but I can gladly recommend Smith of Wootten Major and Farmer Giles of Ham---both terrific little books with deep resonance."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The reason that I read this book is so that I could have some background knowledge to help me understand the book's movie, once it comes out this winter. The book certainly fulfills that purpose, and is a very good book as well, but there are some problems with Tolkien's writing that made it harder to read than it should be.I'm sure that, with all the positive reviews (...), you're already aware of all the better parts of the story, so before I say those opinions for myself, let me say what's not so great about it: pacing problems. The first hundred pages of the book are used solely to provide the backstory, when this could probably have been done in 50 pages. And although the action sequences in the Mines of Moria are appropriately fast-paced, this was done at the expense of one of these scenes making immediate sense- very unfortunate, seeing as this particular scene is practically the climax of the book. And I really wish that the last chapter had just been left out; it feels more like a poorly-worded attempt at starting the next book than an ending. But note that I'm only noting three problems with the book. Those were the only problems that I could identify, and that's saying something about the quality of the rest of the book. Great characters, a consistent world, and generally lots of innovation make me glad I read this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I was just checking this site out for the first time, and I have to leave this comment, those who said this novel is boring should learn the virtue of patience and understanding. The first portion of the book many claim to be boring, in fact it is just slow and is imperative to developing the deep rich story to unfold, much like Stephen King does in his novels(whadda you know he's the most reknowned author of Horror in the world!)so they are quite obviously a key component to the story, while in many novels I read I was left to guess about a character or there were just flat characters. This book will go down in history along with it's other companions. The number of publications Tolkien's many works have recieved is proof of the quality of his work which has set the standard for fantasy writing, which remains unparalleled to this day. Few authors compare to Tolkien, but these in my opinion come closest. Terry Brooks, David Eddings and the duo(Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman). There are many other authors which you already know who write forgettable novels. Tolkien's works are unforgettable and I haven't read this trilogy for 5 or 6 years, when I was in 6th or 7th grade and I only read it once, and I can recall that I did not want it to end, for several days afterward I would just lay flabbergasted on my bed after school and in the morning and dream about the vivid characters and places which Tolkien had unfolded me, I can still remember the entire story after not having turned a page since the years I read it. I have read many other fantasy books and most I found to be the same predictable formula which quickly becomes boring. Sticking through with the remainder of this series you will discover for yourself how Tolkien stands apart."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tolkein has created a world of hobbits, elves, dwarfs and wizards that's so real you feel you're reading a history book. Unfortunately, I wanted to read the rollicking good tale that Tolkein buried with plodding details of topography, weather, and history instead. The pacing is so off that several chapters are given to a character that has nothing to do with the plot, while a pivotal scene involving Galdalf is told as a puny, bland page or two flashback. Luckily, the movie excavated the story and showed us what this book could have been if Tolkein was as skilled at storytelling as he was at world inventing."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I wanted to love this book, but it just didn't happen. I liked it up until about 2/3 of the way through. Tolkien has a keen imagination and a talent for making the reader want to believe in his creations. But there's also an undramatic over-reliance on exposition in his writing that needlessly bogs down the story, ultimately putting a wedge between the characters and reader (at least this one).I wasn't wild about &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but still wanted to give the world of Middle Earth another try. I thought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was a pretty good little adventure-quest story spoiled by a not so great ending.I had a similar experience with &quot;Fellowship&quot;. For the first couple hundred pages, Tolkien had me. &quot;Fellowship&quot; wasn't the best book I'd ever read, but I was certainly immersed in the world, and was enjoying turning the pages.You'll have to excuse me for going to the Titanic for a fitting metaphor, but that's the only thing I can think of at the moment. I felt like the book hit its iceberg at the Meeting of Elron, about 2/3 of the way through.The fun-if-slow-going story comes to a screeching halt as Tolkien goes into mind-numbing hyper-exposition mode for close to 30 pages. The story continues on after that, but falteringly--the fatal damage has already been done. The book just gets heavier and heavier after that, until it just can't stay afloat.There are some great passages and concepts in &quot;Fellowship&quot; (I especially liked the psychological insitefulness Tolkien displays in having the ring possess its possessor). But there is a distance in the way that Tolkien writes his characters that just kept me from becoming fully engaged."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tolkien's book is undoubtedly the pinnacle of the fantasy genre.Peter Jackson's films are a masterful and enthralling adaptation.Rob Inlglis's unabridged narration is a worthy and thoroughly enjoyable audio experience.But this 'dramatization' is so horrendously awful that I couldn't even get through the first CD!The Hobbits sound like demented Chipmunks... Merry is voiced by a woman... Frodo is American... the narrator sounds like an Irish DJ...

I think that if you're a reader looking for a good book, then this is a best-choice that should be read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I began to read this book thinking that with all the praise I had heard it received it would be great, filled with action and adventure. However, the book is so detailed that it gets boring very fast. The extensive descriptions of the places that are being traveled through become work to read. The 360 something pages (I think) of this book could easily be condensed to a little over 250. Great plot and interesting at times but it ends up boring and tedious to read with all the details."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Now, I will start by saying that J.R.R. Tolkien is incredible, and Middle Earth is truly a masterpiece. However, he may have been better off just building the world and letting someone else ghost-write the actual books.The problem is that there isn't a single aspect of Middle Earth that he *doesn't* mention in this book. Since there's no way to just sort of work the details in, there are large amounts of *explaining* by the narrator. Consequently, the book looks more like a documentary than a novel. Tolkien would have been better off leaving out details, if there was no good way to include them without having to actually spend a full chapter describing the Shire.So, if you can put up with the *extraordinarily* slow pace, you may enjoy this book. I would say, though, that this is one of those extremely rare cases where the movie is better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The book I read is named The Fellowship of the Ring from The Lord of the Rings series. The author of the book is J.R.R. Tolkien. The book is the sequel of The Hobbit. The books setting starts of in a town called Hobbition were Bilbo Baggins (the main character in The Hobbit) was shortly having his 111th birthday party. Suddenly one of Bilbo's old friends Gandalf (who is a wizard) came to visit him and talk to him about Bilbo's magic ring that be had found during one of his adventures in the past. Gandalf wanted that ring destroyed and had an argument over it. Bilbo ended up giving the ring to his nephew Frodo and then he disappeared. He left notes to all of relatives including Frodo. Gandalf told Frodo what be wanted to do with the ring (destroy it) and be accepted the mission. He was given help by three other Hobbits named Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Merry went ahead of the others at first.The Company set of on there journey to destroy the ring. The first enemy they came across was the Black Riders. The Black Riders are men on horseback who carry swords with them and cause terror to people. They escaped the Riders and came to where an old farmer's land that has killer dogs. The farmer picked them up and they met up with Merry. They went through a forest and a swamp and came to a land that is called Bree-land. They met a spy named Strider who was sent by Gandalf to met up with the company and lead them through the rest of the adventure. They continued their adventure with a new leader but they were all a little uneasy about Strider. They had another attack from the Black Riders and Frodo was almost turned into one. (Black Riders take a magic knife and stab their victims in the heart and their victims turn into Riders.) The company found out that the Riders want the magic ring. An Elf leader named Elrond met them and they went to the house of Elrond (Elrond's house.) When the company got there Gandalf, Bilbo, and lots of other people were there. There was a long meeting and it was voted that they continued the journey. Gandalf, Glimi (an Elf that joined Bilbo in his journey), and Legolas (an elf representing Elves.) So they continued on the journey. They went through the forest in the dark and were attacked by giant crows and the men were injured. They kept on going and were cornered by wolves and then Gandalf caught them on fire by magic and they escaped. The company moved on and they met (unexpectedly) lots ofOrcs and a few trolls. Gandalf was captured but the rest escaped with a few scratches. They came to a land named Lothlorien. They were given three boats to travel with on their adventure. They traveled on the Great River to get rid of the ring. They went on the shore and were going to get rid of the ring but Frodo and Sam took a boat and they wanted to go destroy The Lord of the Rings (the original keeper of both the magical rings who is evil.) To find out what happens in the rest of the series you have to read part two and three that are named The Two Towers and The Return of the King. I recommend this book to people who like fantasy and magic stories. The Fellowship of The Ring is a good book.By,Lance Hueston"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"First, a disclaimer to those of you who would attack me personally because I didn't like the book: I AM a very intelligent, bright person (straight As in college kind of bright.) I do not believe that (as some have said before in response to unfavorable reviews) any lack of intelligence on my part led to me disliking this particular book.Second, I have not seen the movie. It has been my goal for years now to read the Fellowship of the Ring. I have attempted it at least four times in the last five years, and I finally finished it this evening. The last book I read before this took less than 24 hours to read, and I have been stuggling for two months to read this. In the meantime, I read about 20 other books. I was bored.I understand the concept of world-building. And Tolkien has done a magnificent job of that, I agree. But I also think that world-building is just about the only thing that has gone on here. I was startled by the lack of depth of character. I wanted desperately to care about Frodo, and only in the last ten pages did we really understand that Frodo really has come to grips with his task. Before this moment, Frodo is purely reactionary. He sets off on a journey because he is told to, he eats when he's hungry, sleeps when he's tired. For the majority of the book, he makes no conscious decisions, he only REACTS. Of all of the characters, I felt that Sam was the only one who was remotely accessible. He was the only character whose motivations are clear and interesting. I agree that his loyalty is moving.The journey narrative is so very popular, but describing just about every day &quot;they awoke early that morning&quot; makes me just as tired as the poor pony they drag with them. I am a fan of sci-fi, fantasy and plain old great literature, and damnit, I just wanted something to HAPPEN. I wanted to believe that Tolkien cares what happens to them. I intend to read the next book, because if I don't this is a HUGE letdown. The plot didn't sweep me up at all. If I never read the Two Towers, I'll be just fine. You know it's a great book when you can't breathe until you have the sequel in your hands.This reminds me of Star Wars: Episode 1. This was a narrative so hung up on introducing all the major points, that it in itself doesn't go anywhere. It's the trilogy dilemma! Any author who plans three books from the get go better have a lot of action planned for the first one! But this has no purpose other that to set things up for book two! When Ep. 1 came out, I got so sick of hearing, &quot;Well, they'll explain that in the next movie.&quot; Then why am I investing my time in something so wholly unsatisfying? Why don't I just wait for the next one?I'm also interested to know how many women enjoyed these books. I'm 24, and every man my age gets such a look of joy on his face at the mention of Frodo. I've never spoken to a girl who liked it that much. I wonder why that is? I personally would have enjoyed even a touch of the feminine in this book- I'm not talking romance. I may be a girl, but I normally hate romantic subplots. I just personally lose touch when the female presence is so absent. I think it's a hard book to identify with if you're female. I could be wrong.I just expected so much more in what is considered the greatest fantasy ever written. Maybe that's why I didn't like it- everyone says how great it is, puts it on such a pedestal, that it will never be as great as you all say it is- there's no way it could be. Here's hoping that something interesting happens in the next chapter."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This, being the first part of a trilogy, was long in itself. Four hundred and ten pages, and the pages contain about twice as much as a normal page. The writing is also very, very descriptive and imagery takes the center stage, so many readers (child and adult alike) will struggle with this book. Many will even put it down and deem it unreadable, much like I did the first two time I began it. This book is only for very patient readers. That being said, it's a classic.Pour a cup of tea. Heck, sit it on a tea cozy. Turn off your phone, and absorb the writing. Visualize the mountains, rivers, all of the scenery. Feel what is happening, don't just read it. True, there is a lot of back story that could have been taken out, but it wasn't. So deal, and read it--most of it, if not all, is interesting. The story itself is marvelous, and has shaped the entire genre of fantasy into what it is today. Without Tolkien, all of this \\"world-making\\" going on would have never seen the light of day, so pay homage where homage is due. Not only is this work legendary, it is also very entertaining.The tone grows increasingly dark as the novel progresses, but not awkwardly so. It seems fitting that as the valiant fellowship gets closer and closer to Mordor, the lair of the evil Sauron, that the subject matter should get heavier and the mood should darken. Speaking of the fellowship, Tolkien describes them in such a way that we get closer to all nine members. We get inside their brains and feel how they feel, and especially see what they see.I look forward to \\"The Two Towers\\" and, especially, some more dialogue from Mr. Gollum himself.10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is good for anybody who has the patience to sit down to read a fantasy book, a long one.

With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.The story goes like this: Sixty years after \\"The Hobbit\\", Bilbo prepares to celebrate his \\"eleventy first\\" [that's 111 years] birthday. But after that, he wants to leave the Shire to go to Rivendell [I think.] So he performed a disappearing act using his Ring, and leaves everything to his heir, Frodo Baggins. Frodo learns from Gandalf the Grey that the Ring is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron! He also learns that the \\"Black Riders\\", servants of Sauron, are coming to reclaim the Ring and give it to the resurrected Sauron. So Frodo goes on a quest with his gardener Sam, and two mischievous Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, to destroy the One Ring.[I know this isn't the best plot summary, but I tried.]This book is a bit different and longer than the movie. There is more detail and plot twists in the book than there is in the movie, and at a whopping 423 pages, this will keep you busy. The version I'm reviewing came with a foldable map of Middle-earth!

It may be long, but once you finish a chapter you want to read the next. This story has a lot of adventure and great detail. It's about a Hobbit named Frodo. A Hobbit is a very short person who lives for a long time. Frodo gets a powerful ring that he needs to destroy. The ring can maked Frodo vanish in thin air. The reason Frodo wants to destroy the ring is because the Dark Lord wants to use its power for evil. Frodo goes on an adventure with his friends Merry, Pippen, and Sam. During the book new characters appear in each chapter. They pass through towns,villages, and end up fighting Lords, monsters, and the Dark Lords warriors. This is a really good book.

I really enjoyed how Tolkien makes you wonder what happens at the end of the series and leaves you wanting more.In my personal opinion, the best part of the book is when Frodo Baggins, the main character, and his companions Sam, Merry, Pippen, and Strider are being persued by the Ringwraiths, evil servants of Sauron. The whole first half of the book they are fleeing to Rivindell and wondering what became of the wizard, Gandalf.I enjoyed the conflict of good versus evil that went on throughout the book.

The journey of Frodo is filled with peril, from the Orcs of Mordor down to the slinking menace, Gollum, who stalks Frodo for &quot;his Precious&quot;.

Tolkien sat down to write these books, I doubt that he knew how great they really would be. When reading The Lord of the Rings, you are forced to escape into Middle-Earth for however long you wish to stay there. Unlike other fantasy tales that just don't seem real, this is oftentimes creepy in how it makes you forget where you are. It's almost as if you are the tenth member of the Company.I won't go into any detail about the plot, considering the success of tbe book and the recent movie, it's already a given. But I felt that I needed to say just this one thing:Our world is frightening, stressful and sometimes a bore. However, with Tolkien, you forget where you are and are part of something else, something amazing. 'The Lord of the Rings' is probably the best fiction story of all time. Though not my favorite book, I now understand why it is loved worldwide and why the tale of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins will never die.A rare gem amongst oftentimes disappointing works."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This review is for those who, like me, are not big sci-fi readers, who don't like reading classics just because they ARE classics, and who like to be entertained.I rate a book by two things: Does it paint a picture in my mind and make me feel like I'm watching the movie in my head while I'm reading? Can I put it down at night to go to sleep?If a book is too boring, or difficult to get through (like Tolkien's The Silmarillion) I start getting heavy-eyelid syndrome. Since I don't usually read to &quot;improve my mind&quot; but to be entertained, being put to sleep is not a good sign for me. This problem does not happen with the Lord of the Rings series!The Fellowship of the Ring and the rest of the series are some of the best books for drawing me into the story. In my mind, I can see the hobbits scrambling to keep up with the taller members of the group, I can hear the screams of the Nine, and I can feel the terror of Mordor.The vivid descriptions and characters are matched only by the incredible storyline. This is the kind of book that I'll be reading at 3 a.m. and think, &quot;I'll just read one more chapter and then I'll go to sleep.&quot; Or I'll be working on something that I have to do (like dishes, laundry, etc.) and think &quot;if I just do a little more of this I'll let myself read some more of the book!&quot;This book is strongly recommended to anyone who likes a good story, and who is not daunted by a long tale: sit down, relax, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I loathe some of the newer forms of literature just because they are so tame, I think that they have nothing compared to Tolkien's genius.

I think if Leonard Nimoy would have read this book then istead of Bilbo being &quot;The greatest little hobbit of them all&quot; Frodo would have been talked about more.I liked the story, dialouge, and the vivid presentation of all the people, places, and things the fellowshop comes across. Spontaneous, sad, happy, and merry are only a few words that I could use to describe the story. All inspiring and fun Tolkien is a master of the Fantasy tale.

As soon as I read this book, I was so caught up in Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth that I didn't really think that any other fantasy book could live up to this, and so far none have. Even though the movie was very good, in my opinion you couldn't get quite as much out of it if you had read the book. Anyone who appreciates great fantasy should read it. Even if you don't like it, you should recognize that many fantasy books written today are written after this great trilogy.

The plotline was very unique, making it the original story involving non-mortal creatures such as elves, dwarves and hobbits. Although extremely creative, the plot successfully avoids tangling into a giant mess that is hard to keep track of. The premise is simple, and the characters are well described. Tolkien is wonderful about letting his characters' true identities shine through their actions, rather than long wordy descriptions. Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mount Doom, even though he knows it will end in most likely in death; Legolas befriends Gimli, despite the long history of conflict between their two species (elf and dwarf, respectively); Gandalf tells the others to leave him at the Mines of Moria to save themselves, and leave him to deal with the Balrog. All these actions show the characters' compassion and bravery, without outright stating so. Yet the characters are not divine beings; they have plenty of flaws too. Boromir, and his greed, are revealed when he tries to persuade Frodo to \\"lend\\" him the ring to save his homeland of Gondor. Even though Boromir has good intentions, he is made more realistic in the eyes of the reader, due to his relatable weakness. The settings are also artfully described; the picture painted of L&oacute;thlorien is indeed beautiful, making me almost wistfully wish for some mallorn trees in my back yard. All these are evidence of Tolkien's strong and descriptive writing, yet sometimes this can almost go too far.When Tolkien writes about how Frodo and the three other hobbits (Sam, Merry, and Pippin) journeyed to Rivendell, I sometimes wanted to fall asleep. While I understand the immense lassitude they had to overcome, I still feel as though Tolkien's words were superfluous and often repetitive. Some might disagree that this brings a sense of realism to their journey, but I disagree. I feel as though all his descriptions of their daily meager meals were almost too much, and at some extremely barren parts, I almost wished for an airplane to take them to Rivendell, just to end this tedious \\"torture.\\" Also, while I appreciate the effort Tolkien put into his many songs and poems, I wish there were only a few, to have a bigger impact, rather than many losing their significance from the sheer amount of poems in the book. These two shortcomings made the novel at times not as engaging as one would hope.All in all, The Fellowship of the Ring was an outstanding book, despite being overly descriptive. The characters, story, and settings were all believable, yet whimsical with enough creativity so as to capture the reader's interest. The book would be great for fantasy lovers, especially those who enjoy longer books such as Eragon or other fantasy novels such as Dragon Rider (in spite of an apparent lack of dragons). Readers of Holly Black would probably also enjoy this; and of course, anyone who has seen the movies should definitely give this trilogy a read! I would definitely rate this book a solid 8.5/10 or higher, and would recommend it to any of my friends.-BJ from BHHS '15"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This was a fantastic read.

The Fellowship of the Ring is an AWESOME book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I watched all the Lord of the Rings movies over this summer and loved them in every way whatsoever. I decided to read the books thinking that if the movies were this good, the books must be just as good or better. I raised all my expectations when I started to read The Lord of the Rings Part 1: The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien, and this book met every single one of my expectations, and more. This book was amazing and possibly the greatest book I've ever read. Even though I had already watched the movie, there was a new twist around every corner. And I loved this book because of Tolkien's word choice. He used descriptive words in every sentence. I read this for a project in school and could barely read the book because I was taking so many notes on word choice.In this book, a young Hobbit named Frodo inherits a seemingly harmless ring after his uncle Bilbo's disappearance, but as soon as he puts the ring on, everything changes. Monsters from the evil land of Mordor begin to follow him to take the ring, for this is no ordinary ring. This ring is the master ring of the evil lord Sauron. The ring begins to control him as well. Every time someone asks to see it, he draws back, hissing, and overcome with greed. Soon Frodo realizes it is not safe in his home, he must leave to talk to the elf king Elrond to discuss this matter in Rivendale. Along the way they meet new dangers and assistance until they reach their destination. There, at the council it is decided that nine people will go to destroy the ring, in the fiery pits of mount doom, the only place it can be destroyed. The group of nine, or The Fellowship of the Ring must set out to complete their quest and destroy the ring, once and for all.I would give this book a five out of five, and more if I could. This book is perfect for boys and girls of all ages, although it is a pretty hard read so I wouldn't read it until maybe 7th grade. This book has something every reader loves, action, funny lines, romance, and much more. Also, this book isn't a book to fly through just to get it done; with this book you want to sit down, relax, and have a good time reading it. I really wish that everyone would read this book because it can teach us all a valuable lesson that the entire world needs to know: Great power can cause even the best of us to be overcome with greed. You can learn a lot from this book, so I hope you will read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book was VERY well done. the details and description was amazing and the storyline was so wonderfully unique. i would definitely recommend this book to people who love adventure and something that they cant put down."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I loved the movies but the books are a whole lot better.

Earlier versions are dramatizations, mostly for British radio, (erroneously listed as &#34;unabridged&#34;) but this is word-for-word. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The 3 books are 44 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations.

He actually did a very decent job singing the songs rather than just reading them, which added a lot to the feeling of the recording. The packaging has a little to be desired being made of a cheap thin cardboard with cutouts for the CDs to be put in.

Now, after discovering Goodreads, I found the motivation to finish it.I'm glad I finally did. It's good... but it's not as outstanding, jaw-dropping, eye-popping-ly good as everyone makes it out to be. I'd give it 3.5 stars.One thing I can say about Tolkien is that he absolutely could write! His talent for describing in excruciating detail every single leaf on every single tree is admirable - but it gets a bit much. The book took me just less than two months to read, and if I were to hazard a guess, I probably took in... 60% of it. Tops. I have a tendency to \\"zone out\\" while I'm reading, and have been known to read twenty pages or more and have no recollection of what I've just read. That happened a lot with this book.It's a good story, though. As other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the things in this book can be interpreted as being clich&eacute;d, but you need to understand that they're only clich&eacute;s NOW, because Tolkien invented them! And that's how I tried to read this book. I read it for the HISTORY of the fantasy genre, the history of wargaming, of Dungeons & Dragons and just about every fantasy role-playing game, story or movie that has come since.For people interested in the history of the genre, or people with loads and loads of time to read, I highly recommend this book.

The story, the characters, everything about it. J.R.R. Tolkein is a genius. The story that is unfolded is exciting, action packed, and every other aspect you could want in a book. The characters are unique and truly awe inspiring. From the tiny hobbits with stout hearts to the strong and mysterious ranger Strider. This is a story that will capture your imagination and your heart. You'll cheer for Frodo as he carries the burden of the ring and be touched when Sam shows his everlasting loyalty and friendship to him. The Fellowship of the Ring will reach out to you like no other book. Not only are the characters inspiring, but the places are truly astounding. From the hobbit holes to the beautiful elven city of Rivendale. My personal favorite is the underground mines where the dwarves had awakened a monster from the depths of the earth. Something so terrible that even the great Gandalf is scared of it. Another I think is just as amazing is where an elf queen resides. It's an entire town in the trees. All the locations in this book are just beautiful. J.R.R. Tolkein has created a book that will enhance lives throughout the ages. It will touch people with its intriguing story and truly unique and amazing characters and open your imagination with its environments. This is a must have for everybody. And it never gets boring. This book will amaze you and inspire you; it's definitely a classic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of The Lord of the Rings, continues the chronicles of the small folk known as Hobbits and their role in the War of the Ring. Longer, more complicated, and far darker than The Hobbit (\\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings,\\" as Ballantine Books' marketing division puts it), this first installment of three places the destiny of Middle-Earth in the hands of a hobbit.It's been over 50 years since Gandalf the Wizard and a party of 12 Dwarves enlisted Bilbo Baggins to serve as their \\"burglar\\" in their quest to recover the Dwarves' treasure hoard from the dragon Smaug, who terrorized the lands near the Lonely Mountain. After facing trolls, giant spiders, and orcs (called goblins in The Hobbit), the survivors of that adventure returned home and went on with their lives....But even though Bilbo Baggins returned to Hobbiton with a bit of treasure and a tale to set down on paper for future generations, he also brought back a dangerous piece of jewelry, a ring he had found in a cave during one of his misadventures as the \\"burglar.\\" Plain and apparently ordinary, the ring had the ability to render its wearer invisible. This power helped Bilbo escape from the ring's previous owner, the strange creature known as Gollum, and saved the hobbit and his friends from several sticky situations.The Fellowship of the Ring's narrative begins with a long introduction that explains the book's connections to The Hobbit. Tolkien gives us more background information on hobbits, their history and traditions, and even a short treatise on pipeweed, the Middle-Earth version of tobacco. After this explanatory preface, the narrative focuses on the next generation of hobbit adventurers, especially Bilbo's nephew and heir Frodo, his gardener and loyal friend Samwise Gamgee, and his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took.Gandalf, the Wizard who'd enlisted Bilbo more than 50 years earlier, returns to serve as both mentor and protector for Frodo, and it is he who reveals to the younger Baggins the true nature of Bilbo's ring. It is, as all Tolkien readers know, no ordinary magic ring, but a dangerous Ring of Power, forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron to control the other Rings of Power crafted by Elves he had deceived into making for him to rule over the three major races of Middle-Earth. It's also Gandalf who enlists Frodo to go on a perilous quest to take the One Ring out of the Shire and to find a way to destroy it forever.Tolkien's tale is entertaining and at the same time a challenging piece of literature. He uses different styles of writing to tell his tale, ranging from straightforward narrative prose to poems full of references to Middle-Earth mythology, some of which makes more sense after reading his posthumous work The Silmarillion. Some readers (especially younger ones) may feel overwhelmed by all the songs and epic saga-style poetry, but patience with this book is a virtue with its own reward. The Lord of the Rings is one of those rare fantasy tales that has stood the test of time, as proved by its enduring popularity and the popular and critical success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the one of the best books I have ever read because it is a story of an adventure and love to read adventure books. I knew this was going to be a great book because I have read the Hobit and that was a good book too. Yet I wouldn't read any of the Lord of the Rings books until you've read the Hobit because the Hobit is the first book of the series and would be confusing if you didn't read the Hobit first. The Fellowship of Ring may be a long book, over 400 pages, but is a great book none the less and is worth spending a little time to read it. If you like books about dragons, wizards and other fantasy characters this would be a great book for you because what the book is about a hobit, who's the heir of Bilbo, must overcome many difficulties to try to get the ONE RING destroyed by tossing it in the belly of Mt. Doom."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book (and when I say \\"this book,\\" I mean the entire trilogy) is an extremely intricate and powerful book that rewards multiple readings. To call it a good \\"adventure book\\" or to note that modern fantasy literature is virtually all just sincere flattery of Tolkien or to observe that Tolkien's own precedents were epic and mythological literature or to wonder at the depth, consistency, beauty and, above all, REALITY of Tolkien's Middle Earth is to damn with faint praise. Read it again. There is always something more.What struck me during my most recent reading was the deeply Christian ethos of the book. The ring is, of course, the power to indulge one's pride, the capacity for ultimate self-aggrandizement. The heroes of the west are all great because they are all able to deny themselves that power: Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, even Boromir (after a moment's slip) are all great because they are humble. There's a wonderful passage in Mordor where Sam is wearing the ring and sees himself as the irresistible gardener, striding through the wasteland with a flaming sword and using the power of the ring to restore the land. It's delightful characterization and powerful writing.(...)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"How does that adage go: &quot;Some books are to be tasted, others nibbled upon, others devoured whole&quot;? I am used to reading &quot;pop&quot; fiction that can be ravaged in a day or two. Reading this book, however, gave me a new experience altogether - taking my time to see each image in my head and ponder each happening. It's a &quot;nibbling&quot; book, if you will.Tolkien has painted an incredibly detailed world in Middle Earth. After reading the 40-page forward, you can really appreciate how much thought he actually put into this. I found the forward a bit tedious, but it refreshed my memory on the Hobbit (read years ago) and gave me a good backdrop of the story.The characters are fantastic, and although a few of the secondary characters are little-mentioned, the main characters (Frodo, Sam, Pippen, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, et. al.) are rendered in great detail so that you soon begin to like them all very much for their feats (and their faults). Every adventure, every turn in Frodo's great quest to return a dark and mysterious ring, is so fascinating that I could only read about 30 pages at a time before closing the book, closing my eyes, and pondering and recreating what I had just read in my mind. I think that anyone willing to take the time and not rush through this one will really enjoy it. Happy trails!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Following the advice of my good friend (and a much more experienced Tolkien reader), I read \\"The Hobbit\\" before tackling the Lord of the Rings trilogy. \\"The Hobbit\\" is the prequel that introduces the creatures (hobbits, elves, and dwarves) and their manner of adventuring. This is particularly useful when facing the prologue to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (the first book of the trilogy followed by \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\").*** Tolkien uses his prologue in \\"Fellowship\\" to give more background about hobbits as creatures and their history. You have to delay satisfying your appetite for adventure while Tolkien gives you this important set-up. -- Have patience! You will be rewarded.*** Hobbits and dwarves are physically not unlike people -- except for the height difference and the mortality rates (humans are taller and shorter lived). There is a rustic beauty in Tolkien's cast of creatures. They pass on their stories and traditions through song and folklore. But there is also magic at play -- for good and for evil.*** The basic story is this: There is a Ring, created by dark powers and once thought to be lost, that is now in the innocent possession of a young hobbit named Frodo. The Dark Lord, Sauron, sends his servants, known as the Ringwraiths or the Nine Riders, to reclaim the Ring from Frodo. Thus pursued, Frodo engages the help of three fellow hobbits (including the ever-faithful Sam) and learns that the fate of the Ring will determine the fate of the world itself.*** Tolkien creates a very detailed epic. Admittedly, readers may be discouraged by the prospect of all the names and places. However, the basic story is never lost. A helpful trick is to see yourself in Frodo's shoes. The young hobbit is confused himself, but always in the thick of the action. He meets up with amazing companions like Gandalf the Wizard and the heroic Aragorn, and finds refuge in the idyllic elven realms.*** Danger lurks and strikes in one adventure after the next. Frodo and Co. are in it for the long haul and most readers will be too. If you've made it through to the end of \\"Fellowship\\", you'd better have the sequel, \\"The Two Towers\\", close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"My daughter tells me I should occasionally read fiction. \\"To be more 'well rounded',\\" she says. She asked me to read Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I had tried reading Tolkien about thirty years ago. I just couldn't -- too many odd, invented proper nouns. And worse. Elves, dwarfs, Hobbits, trolls, orcs, Barrow-wights, Dark Riders, wizards, Rangers, a Balrog (\\"This is a foe beyond any of you\\"), and even more mysterious beings? Be serious -- not worth the effort, I thought.Well, I read The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I had difficulty making my peace with those strange place names and those stranger character names, yet I pressed on. Eventually I found a pretty good story. In truth, I believe the story is something beyond the genre-pioneering work of epic fantasy that critics generally consider Tolkien's Rings books to be. There are certain philosophical and spiritual themes as well. This strong undercurrent is not difficult to find, yet the reader need not recognize it (I'm guessing that many do not) to enjoy the adventurous journey, as Frodo warns his friends: \\"You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\\"Some say the story beneath the story is one of environmental stewardship (I don't know, this wasn't a burning issue in Tolkien's England). Others tend toward the theistic themes of providence (an abstracted 23rd Psalm?) or the relentless conflict between virtue and evil. Some cite social or even political themes -- a bit of a reach on the latter, I'd say. Only a servant of the Dark Lord would deny the theistic themes. The story is rich and deep enough to support all of these ideas, and too much may be made of them; if Tolkien had wished to pen a philosophical dissertation he would have done so. The Fellowship is the first of the highly imaginative Rings trilogy. A good book, even if fiction will never be a genre with which I spend a high percentage of my reading time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As of this writing (Mar 2011), only this title, The Fellowship of the Ring, and the third book, The Return of the King, are available on the Kindle.

What makes this story great is it's scale. Of such magnitude that it would be an understatement to call it an epic. The story begins with a genuine innocence, but becomes increasingly darker and full of more action as it goes on. Tolkien's brilliance can easily be enjoyed by falling in love with the characters he has created. He has formed and effectively layed down the ground work of fantasy/science fiction for hundreds of authors to follow in his footsteps by creating such ideas. When it comes to such stories, Tolkien is the master. This story kept me wanting more the entire way through. What really intrigued me as a reader was the intense details Tolkien uses to describe every aspect of the action in the story.

Tolkien writes this book \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\"; he was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa on January 3, 1892. His memories of Africa are Vivid, but one encounter with a big hairy spider stuck in his mind. He wrote his first book \\"The Hobbit\\" and this was published in 1937.

Tolkien creates a whole new world; it has elves, dwarfs, men, and of course, hobbits. Being the major RPG/Adventure buff that I am, the Lord of the Rings series was right up my alley. This book, though, isn't just for RPG buffs; anyone who wants to have some adventure in their lives must read this book. It grabs you from the first line, and rips you till the last word. My greatest feeling on this book is that it can be so widely imagined, you imagination can run wild while reading this. The movie also goes great with the books, there are a few parts that they left out, but the movie is very gripping to watch. \\"Two Towers\\" the second of the trilogy is an amazing movie.

I started reading The Lord of the Rings when the movies were starting to come out. I started reading the Fellowship of the Ring during the time when the first of the three movies was coming out. I am now reading the Two Towers which is starting to get a little interesting in the plot. The story is very well written and created thanks to Tolkien's years of commitment of creating a very giant world filled with humans, elves, dwarves, and a variety of creature races that are good and evil. The writing style of Tolkien is simple in a way, making young people also able to read the book. Since Tolkien created such a huge world and a series of time periods that spanned for years and years, it was kind of hard to understand some of the terms that existed in this book were confusing and made me do some research on Tolkien's world and had to flip on the atlas which is actually quite useful. It's a good beginning to a great adventure as I read Frodo starting to begin his new adventure with Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the dwarf, and Legolas the elf. It also ties well to the movie but it has more detail, extra scenes, and more characters that pose a great significance to the story (like Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel). Why the four stars? It's a very impressive book but not the best book I've read. The book is a great beginning to this series and I'm looking forward to see what the Two Towers has to offer. Before you read this book, read The Hobbit, because it tells some more detail on Hobbits, Dwarves, and Gandalf as it will give the inside track on what happened before Frodo got the Ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"i liked this book however it was kind of difficult to read. there was way too much details and names to remember therefore making this a slow read book. the plot and charactors were described and written magnificantly throughout the book. i have also seen the movie and there are a few parts not in the movie, but that does not really matter. it was a great book, i recomend this book to someone that has a very good reading skill and likes to read, if they dont like to read and dont have a very good reading skill than this will be a difficult book for them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Finally, a book I actually like, in and out! Tolkien amazes me with his ability to imagine the diverse characters and places in The Lord of the Rings. This book portrays leadership, and the long enduring of good in an evil world. I am very pleased with the detail that Tolkien puts into the novel so that the reader can understand completely each situation. Tolkien writes the book so that the readers feel as if it could be real. It's an outstanding novel that teaches us that we need to bear our burdens and stick together so that good can prevail in a world of such turmoil.Tolkien has made me think a lot more about my characteristics and whether or not I would be able to bear the ring. Would I be able to withstandthe temptation of putting on the ring? Or using it's power for my own good? It's an outstanding concept. This book leaves you in anticipation for the next. The suspense of what is going to happen next is nerve-racking.Overall, I just enjoyed the material, and I feel that Tolkein is a very experienced writer. He knows how to captivate readers, and enthral their minds into the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Brilliant. Awe-inspring. Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.And Tolkien's story evolves--parallel to the turbulent and terrible years of World War II, when he was working on Part 1, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. The book, as it progresses, takes on a darker, more ominous tone, a reflection of the inherent danger manifesting itself in Great Britain under a relentless Nazi attack.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING begins in a lighthearted, almost whimsical fashion, much like Tolkien's prequel, \\"The Hobbit.\\" Case in point: Tom Bombadil. When Frodo and fellow companions Sam, Merry, and Pippin are bewitched by a menacing willow in the Old Forest that has magical powers, Tom Bombadil bursts onto the scene spouting poetry, saving the day. Better yet, when Frodo and his friends fall victim to the Barrow Wights, Frodo recites a poem that instantly brings Bombadil to the rescue. This is fairy tale prose, very much like the tone from \\"The Hobbit,\\" where even when a character is in danger there is no sense of doom or foreboding.And yet, the story evolves, because Frodo's quest becomes more dangerous, disturbing. From the attack at Weathertop, to the confrontation with the Nazgul at the Ford, to the Council of Elrond, the crossing of the Mines of Moria, the imposing majesty of the Argonath, to the breaking of the Fellowship at Parth Galen on the banks of the Anduin, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING becomes a sweeping, vivid account of Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring--to save Middle-earth.Hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, wizards, orcs...Tolkien gives us a rich fantasy world that is as believable as it is dangerous. Enriched by its similarities to medieval lore, this is storytelling unsurpassed. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I thought The Lord of the Rings \\"The Fellowshipof the Rings\\" was really fantastic.

It's narrated by one man, Rob Inglis, doing the entire thing as he apparently used to on stage. He does the voices, he sings the songs. He also did The Hobbit for Recorded Books, and Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea books. He's marvelous. It's like having a wizened grandfather read you a story.

And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book.

Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a fantasy book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It takes place in a land known as Middle Earth. There are elves, wizards, dwarves, orcs, and hobbits. This story appeals to readers young and old. For someone who enjoys other fantasy books, this would be a great book to have because you can read it over and over again. However, this is only one book in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. To be able to read the entire tale you also need to purchase The Two Towers and The Return of the King which complete the story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because of my own love of fantasy. I read this book for my school PACES Paideia and they provide a Study Guide that can help you with the book. It is divided into weeks and it gives you different assignments to do. For each week there is vocabulary, parent questions (questions for the parent to ask the student), occasionally a small writing assignment, and a theme tracker chart which helps get the literary elements straight. The study guide really helped me understand some of the deeper meanings of the story not just what is obvious to an average reader. This book is perfect for any fantasy lover or just a reader looking for a new adventure. Even if you do not like reading much you will cling to this book because it is extremely interesting and an overall great book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Classic book. Can read over and over. Much better then the movies!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Having never before read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", or even seen the movies, I decided to give the \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" a try to see what all the fuss is about. I wasn't disappointed. Tolkien presents a stunning world of ancient legends, characters and vivid scenery that is as real to the reader as any movie could produce. This is a stunning work and well worthy of all the praises it has received.The most potent aspect of this novel is the vivid descriptions as the voyagers trod through the vast lands of Middle-earth on their epic quest. Tolkien describes sweeping panoramic vistas, roaring rivers, and foreboding mountains with such detail and elegance as to transport the reader into his own world. Indeed, if the reader has but an ounce of imagination, it is not hard to picture the glory of Middle-earth with all of its inhabitants, such as the majestic and grand elves of Lothlorien, or the loathsome and evil Gollum and the Dark Riders. Yet, the detail is not too burdensome. Tolkien has a gift for using just the right words to paint a vivid scene, yet to not burden the reader with too much unneeded detail.Tolkien's Middle Earth comes through as a mythological wonderland, one that has survived for ages of legends and kings, tales and history. Tolkien's attention to detail is remarkable. Not only in the songs and language of the different races, but also in the history and legends of the ancient days. There is a long, detailed chronology of the different races. There are a myriad of tales of the ancient kings and rulers of Middle-earth. Indeed, this may prove to be too burdensome for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novice, as the novel begins with a lengthy account of the Middle-earth and its history. However, these stories are interwoven into the very fabric of Middle-earth that makes it so real, yet lend it a mythological aura.The recurring theme of the corruption of power illustrates the peril of the One Ring, the ring who brings its wearer ultimate power. Yet, this power is ultimately evil, for it will corrupt the wearer, no matter how inherently good he is. This aura of power corrupts even the most pure of heart. This is a stern warning that the pursuit of power will inevitably lead to evil, despite what the original intentions may be.Another warning is about the pursuit of knowledge, for knowledge is a kind of power. It is the dwarves and their pursuit of knowledge that originally awoke the \\"evil\\" lying beneath the mountains. Although knowledge is usually desirable, Tolkien makes a distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom puts forth a moral dimension to knowledge, for it is knowing the consequences of actions, and also the ability to choose between good and evil.It is significant that Frodo, a hobbit of diminutive size and stature, is chosen as the ring bearer. The hobbits are usually only concerned with their own petty lives in the Shire and love good food and drink. Yet, Frodo is chosen to be the penultimate bearer of the One Ring. For strength and might do not make a hero, but a strong heart and iron will to resist temptation are the rigid foundations of a hero. Frodo may start out as a young, inexperienced hobbit, yet he leaves on an epic quest and is determined, despite all odds, to complete his mission. Indeed, Frodo proves that even the unlikeliest of heroes can shine when their time comes due.So whether you're an avid fan and have read the books and seen the movies many times, or whether you're a Johnny-come-lately like myself, this novel is a must-read. Now it's on to the part 2 of the saga - \\"The Two Towers.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There is no need to review Tolkien's work, his plots and characters, here. But this is simply the best audio version there is. Peter Jackson's movie trilogy is great, the BBC audio versions are fine, but this version is unabridged and that is what matters. All of the events, all of the poetry, all of the imagery, are here. Rob Inglis does a superb job of narration, with enough vocal variation to distinguish the characters. If the Lord of the rings is in your blood, and Tolkien's words are part of your soul, then this is the version for you. I lost the ability to read, to hold a book, to turn a page, but now I can go to Middle Earth and any part of Middle Earth any time I choose. And that my dears is precious!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The first part of the trilogy that helped fantasy get where it is today. If you've seen the movies and not read the books, you are still missing so much of what Tolkien has to offer."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring the Tolkien books, thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.We open some sixty years after the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is &quot;Mad Baggins&quot;). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the &quot;feel&quot; of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential &quot;little guy&quot; hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say &quot;everyhobbit.&quot;We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of &quot;Hobbit&quot; -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. A must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I chose to read \\"Fellowship of The Ring\\" for a class project. It is a very well written book, which is the first of a trilogy. The author of the series of books is J.R.R Tolkien. It is a wonderful story of adventure in a different world.It all starts with a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, finding a ring. A hobbit is a man like creature but only smaller. He then gives the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. Then Gandalf the grey a wizard friend of Frodo's figures out that Frodo's ring is the ring of power made in the mountain of Doom. It is made to control all the other rings and all the inhabitants of Middle Earth. It can only be destroyed in the Mountain of Doom where it was created. So Frodo sets off on a journey to destroy the ring. Along with him were Sam, Merry, and Pippin some of Frodo's hobbit buddies. During their long journey they stopped at Rivendale, a place where elves live. Then there Frodo meets up with Gandalf and other great warriors. The warriors consisted of two men, an elf, a wizard, a dwarf, and the four hobbits. Then they all head for the Mountain of Doom. They come upon many obstacles and different adventures.Tolkien writes this book marvelously. The way he describes the lands they go through makes you feel like you are there in middle earth. This book is for anyone who loves adventure tales of good and evil. This book has a great storyline and will keep you hooked the whole time you are reading it. This book can be read by people of all ages. Everybody that loves the idea of a different world will love this book. It is definitely a great book and should be read by everybody."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have to admit, I had never read any of Tolkien's works until now. I had a niggling doubt in my mind that his writing was dry due to the time period in which he wrote his novels. But with the movies forthcoming, I figured I should read them and see what they were all about. I must say that i was presently surprised.The first thing that jumped out at me was exactly how much he has influenced fantasy both as a book genre and also from a role-playing game standpoint. His dwarves and elves are templates for how they are used in modern FRPGs.The story moved along at quick pace, although the beginning was a little dry and slow. But once it started it went at a breakneck pace that kept me glued to the book. I'd sneak it into work to be able to keep reading it.This starts the journey of Frodo Baggins. He is given the Ring that Bilbo won from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and sets out on a journey to destroy it before the evil forces from Mordor can get their hands on it and return it to the one who created it. (Can't recall the name right this second) The only problem is that the ring causes it's bearer to desire it with an intesity that can bring about murder to obtain or keep the ring.If you plan on watching the movies when they come out, I suggest you bone up on the books so you can see the movies with a trained eye to the details."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Really, so this reads like a book report. Those who hate that kind of thing should skip this or succumb to its lack of opinionism. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is J.R.R. Tolkien's sequel to his previous book, The Hobbit. It starts with Bilbo Baggins, the hero of The Hobbit, giving his nephew, Frodo Baggins, a ring that hasa the initial power to make you invisible, but has other strong powers that few are privelaged to know. Dark forces in the world are gathering, and Frodo's ring is their last key in their quest to take over the world. So Frodo, accompanied by a powerful wizard and several other companions, sets out in a quest to destroy the ring, which is too powerful to eliminate by conventional means. In his journey to the land of Modar, where he could destroy the ring, Frodo is pursued by many strange beings. Among them are three mysterious riders clad in black. With black steeds they tracked Frodo from the beginning of the book. They seem to have strange powers, like the ability to sniff out Frodo from a mile away. They are but a fraction of the diverse, strange characters that are scattered throughout this book. All the strange characters and the way the environments are described in such full detail bring Frodo's world to life. Whoever likes adventure books will surely be pleased by this book, which is one of the benchmarks of the genre."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the final instalment in my reviews of the three volumes of the Lord of the Rings as read by Robert Inglis.Anyone who has read my first two will know by now that I am no fan of his style OR delivery. Having said that, and I feel it necessary to say this at the outset of each review to forestall the lynching: this is the ONLY unabridged version that is available, and it not nearly so objectionable that it can not be recommended. Indeed, I feel compelled, my misgivings notwithstanding to place this version in a \\"must have\\" category - but only until a better version comes along - Frederic Davidson? Where are you? Your country and Tolkein's readers need you!It is my view that Inglis does Tolkien and his characters great disservice in many and varied ways. Aragorn comes across as an arch, cloying, pompous lout. The Hobbits are uniformly presented as servile, unctuous, country bumpkins - Sam is the worst. Legolas is fay and effeminate - almost goofy. There are times you just want to smack his Frodo and say, \\"oh for god's sake man, get a grip on yourself.\\" I was NEVER annoyed with any of these characters when I read the book, but one can easily become annoyed with them as presented by Inglis.An interesting \\"acid test\\" for this is Peter Jackson's movie version. Virtually ALL of his actors and characters get it \\"right\\" - and Inglis does not do well by the comparison.When Inglis does get it right, he is capable of \\"nailing it\\". Gandalf is excellent, Gollum brilliant, and Treebeard surpassing.The problem is that Inglis has a deep voice and is incapable of pitching it into the higher registers. His performance rapidly degrades with the number of characters he is required to present in a short period of time. \\"Return of the King\\" is the worst of the three volumes because there is a welter of voices - most of them men. At times it is hard to remember who the heck is speaking - so similar do the voices become.And there is another, more insidious problem - my brother Ross first noted this. When Inglis is required to deliver scenes of great drama - he becomes somewhat shrill and affected.And now I will allow myself on comment on the book itself. I read this book as a youth - I was enchanted. And I came back to it as a perhaps jaded 47 year old. You know what disappointed me the most? It is the PRFOUNDLY undemocratic nature of Tolkein's tale. Of course the immediate riposte to this is that it is a fairy-tale. And fairy-tales are all about kings and queens. Well, yes, sure, SOME of them are - but by no means all of them.But The Rings is a tale of a pagan time and as my friend Fox and I were discussing, the pagan world was distinctly non-aristocratic. And it is not as though Tolkein didn't have loads of democratic or semi-democratic models to crib from. I cringed as the aristocratic leaders made ALL the decisions for their men - there is no HINT of collective decision making. I thought constantly of the Iliad and the Anabasis of Xenophen -- where the lords and their men regularly debate policy, strategy and even tactics. Does this destroy the book? Of course not. But I do view the apotheosis of Aragorn, for that is what it is, as the central failure of the book. Tolkein had a magnificent opportunity to have his Aragorn cast off the tyranny of aristocratic blood-lines and establish a democratic society wherein men were governed by elected officials and the rule of law. And this could have been done without compromising the romance of the story one whit.But that's just me...a 47 year old curmudgeon! You'll find me happily ensconced in hell with the tyrannicides and regicides."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Just bought all three parts of the LOTR trilogy on CD.

It is not a person reading the book to you. I'm going to listen to it and then either sell it or gift it but I am very disappointed. Amazon needs to be careful in lumping together reviews of products that once existed with new ones and with different formats, etc. This is not acceptable."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I originally read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy about 25 years ago while still in college. At the time it was all the rage as a leisure time read.With the release of the movie we are now seeing a resurgence in popularity of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.As a work of fantasy , the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stands out from the rest of the pack of would be fantasy novels like a Rembrandt at an amatuer art exhibition. In this regard I have concluded that GOOD fantasy is extremely hard to write. There are alot of wannabe fantasy writers that simply attempt to imitate Tolkien (for the most part they just don't get the job done!).The \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first book in the\\"Lord of the Rings\\" , trilogy and introduces the One Ring , or the master ring of power forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. In the novelette that timewise preceeds this book , \\"The Hobbit\\" , Bilbo Baggins finds the magic ring and after a series of adventures , returns to the Shire and retires to a remarkably long life.\\"The Fellowship\\" begins with allusions of a stirring of evil power attributed to a resurgence of the power of Sauron and the issuance of the nine dark riders , the high Nazgul , who are afield in search of the One Ring.Gandalf the Grey , apparantly a jolly old wizard , comes to Bilbo's birthday party to provide fireworks , and convinces Bilbo to leave the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins before once again going on the road for an adventure.And thus begins an epic quest for Frodo. Gandalf arranges for Frodo to take the ring and depart the Shire , accompanied by his faithful friend , Samwise Gamgee. On the road to Bree , Frodo and Samwise encounter two other young Hobbits , Merry and Pippin , who also enter the \\"Fellowship\\" . \\"Strider\\" , as he is called manages to rescue the young Hobbits from the Nazgul at Bree , and becomes the guide of the group.Along the way , many other amazing characters of Middle Earth are encountered , and many adventures transpire. Gandalf emerges as a mighty and powerful wizard , who uses his awesome powers to aid Frodo and his companions on the ultimate quest to the fires ofMount Doom , into which Frodo plans to cast the One Ring and forever destroy the power of Sauron.In my mind what sets the entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy apart from it's imitators is the author's knowledge of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon legends and language. There is also a warmth to the characters , the Hobbits in particular , that is missing in other fantasy works. Frodo and Samwise exhibit reservoirs of strength , determination , and courage that is unexpected.Altho' fantasy is not my favorite genre , I am rather fond of this particular work. It is exceedingly well-crafted and written by a master of his discipline. I rate this part of the trilogy 4 stars ; this is a comparative rating to the other two segements which I rate as 5 stars.

In some areas, he deliberately didn't overdo the descriptions of such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.I will warn you that you should have the second and third books on hand when you read this. As this was originally intended to be one huge chunk of a book, it ends on a semi-cliffhanger. (The movie ends in about the same place, so if it frustrated you there, you'd be frustrated here as well) If you're a person who can't handle anything more complex than a half-hour sitcom, or think that Harry Potter is the pinnacle of modern literature, then this book is not for you.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit with a fascination for Elves to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I first read The Hobbit in grade school, and loved the adventure and excitement of Bilbo&#65533;s journey to Lonely Mountain to defeat the evil dragon. But I grew bored mid-way through Fellowship of the Ring, as the second half of that book focused on the ancient histories and alien geography of Middle Earth. I never finished the trilogy.When I picked up both books fifteen years later, I had the reverse experience. The Hobbit was still fun to read, but rather childish and simple. On the other hand, FOTR captured my imagination because of the incredibly complex, detailed lore surrounding Middle Earth. Tolkien spends much time discussing the differences in attitudes, customs, and languages of his three major races &#65533; men, dwarves, and elves &#65533; almost as if he were writing an anthropology textbook rather than a novel.Frodo&#65533;s mission to destroy the Great Ring, while exciting, serves primarily as device to flesh out the mythos of the Middle Earth universe. Indeed, some of the most exciting action scenes in the recent movie version (Gandalf&#65533;s battle with the evil wizard; the capture and escape of Gollum) occur &#65533;off camera&#65533; in the book and are related to the reader second-hand. Other important sequences, such as the battle with the demon balrog, occupy only a few brief pages.This book is not for everybody. It demands a lot of patience through long passages of exposition and backstory. It leaves gaps in the narrative for readers to flesh out in their imaginations. But, once you begin to understand the intricacies of Tolkien&#65533;s world, it becomes an engrossing experience. I will wait another year before reading the next volume (just in time for the movie, probably). But I plan to buy a copy of the Silmarillion this week to brush up on the stories of ancient Middle Earth, events alluded to in FOTR but never fully explained."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"...the book is better. Better in the sense that Tolkien's language is so rich and his descriptions of Middle Earth and his characters so vivid that these are virtually impossible to capture in full in the film-makers medium. With that said, however, I think Peter Jackson's film is a phenomenal piece of work and probably as true to Tolkien's vision as possible.I am not a fan of fantasy fiction, but this book (the Lord of the Rings, that is, of which this is just a piece) transcends the genre to rank as one of the 20th century's greatest works of literature in English language. Give it a few pages, and then be prepared to be swept up in a world utterly unlike our own, and yet, particularly in light of what's going on in the world today, so chillingly similar.Fantastic - almost prophetic - stuff."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Many of the negative reviews here conjure up an image of a single type of critic. There may of course be exceptions, but the complaints seem to come from people born within the last 25 years, those who are mostly indoctrinated in the fast and the flashy, the dumbed-down, the highly edited movies and TV shows of their youth, those more comfortable punching a remote control than turning a page. Well, this isn't for them, pure and simple, and they should have known that when they saw the size of it. Tolkien's lengthy descriptions of the landscape are welcome as far as I'm concerned; he had a love for the natural world and it shows. At the very least, if anything in print can get you away from asphalt and cell phones, this is it. In my mind that's a great part of its charm. His description of the Shire is based on rural England as he knew it and loved it before the First World War, and he wants us to experience that through a fictional medium. And many years ago, when I first read it, the references to the earlier histories of Middle Earth, whether expounded in conversation or song, were among the most fascinating aspects of it, and I can't imagine why anybody would object to that if they're voluntarily reading the thing in the first place. It adds greatly to the depth and involvement in this other world, and does not - repeat, does not - noticeably slow down the action. The style has been criticized as &quot;archaic&quot;. If they want archaic, they should try William Morris' fantasy novels of the 1890s. Tolkien keeps the archaism under control. In fact, the style is one of the most remarkable things about the book. Since The Fellowship of the Ring follows immediately (plotwise) upon The Hobbit, which was written as a children's book in the 1930s, to smooth over the transition to this more serious and complex work the author starts out in a style similar to that of The Hobbit, and gradually brings it up to a more mature level before Frodo makes it to Rivendell. This is done so unobtrusively that I've never seen it mentioned before. It's one of the more subtle strengths of the work. The style, admittedly, changes somewhat in later situations, but deliberately, and the so-called archaic writing that appears when the action is in the field before Minas Tirith in The Return of the King, for example, is entirely appropriate and adds just the right atmosphere. In any case, it's very readable and never difficult going, unless you need everything spelled out in monosyllables. A comment that Tolkien borrows too much from Arthurian fantasy is just meaningless. Everything borrows from something, and most of the motifs of Arthurian fantasy are found elsewhere anyway. Arthurian legend itself was a series of borrowings until it reached the form we know today. If I have any criticism of the book, it's that at some places in the plot things are obviously rigged for the good guys to succeed. For example, in Book 1, when Frodo and his pals are in the Shire one night lying low as a Black Rider is creeping up on them, drawn by the power of the Ring, suddenly a troop of Elves, rarely seen in the Shire, just happen to show up to scare off the Rider. Whew! That was close. Something like that happens several times in the Trilogy. But such plot abuse is so common in fiction and movies that it's almost forgiveable. Is it the greatest novel ever written? Hardly. But it's certainly one of the most sheerly entertaining things I've ever read. To repeat what a lot of readers have said before,&quot;The book is too short.&quot;(BL, Tucker, GA)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I purchased the CD version of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; which states on the back of the box that it contains the both the original Forward and Prologue.

Go back to reading Harry Potter. This isn't a novel, it's literature. It may be above your head, but don't deny it for that. It's not the book's fault. Simply put, these books defined fantasy. Very few fantasies out today haven't lifted a page from Tolkien. If you can't handle the book because it's deeper than Xena, fine. But, respect it for what it is."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There used to be two ways to read The Lord of The Rings, now there will be three. It used to be that you either read this book before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit. Now it will also be either before or after you've seen the movies which you saw before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit. However you arrive you will not be disappointed. If you come from 'The Hobbit' it continues the story of the One Ring as it passes from Bilbo to Frodo, and as they, Gandalf, and the world become more aware of what has happened and what the ring really means. While reading this book you'll hear clues to many other, older, stories and myths of ages gone by (the three ages of Middle Earth) and at first you'll pass over them, and you'll enjoy the adventure of Frodo and the fellowship facing their collective and individual destinies.If, however, you read the Silmarillion before reading this book, you'll immediately recognize people, places, and things that carry a much greater history, which can add greatly to your enjoyment. The meaning of places and items encountered will carry the wealth of meaning associated with mythology in our literature. It has been said that these stories all grew out of Tolkien's attempt to invent a language, and his awareness that you can't invent a language without inventing a mythology and history to go along with it.Another option is to read all of them several times, and the good news is that they hold up. These books are all good enough to be enjoyed with several readings. Which leads to the further temptation of all those other Middle Earth books that Christopher Tolkien has been editing.For now, if you're just starting, start with 'The Hobbit', it's an easy read, it introduces many characters that are referenced in 'The Lord Of The Rings' and gives you a general introduction to the land and people of Middle Earth. Then 'The Lord of The Rings'. As much as you may like to read just one, the three all go together and they are a compelling tale. Then, if you really want to know more about those characters, and the history that precedes them, The Silmarillion. By that time you'll be a true fan and can decide on your own whether to go back to the beginning or on through all the other bits and pieces that are being discovered.This is a really rich fable. It's been written out of a deep love of language, literature, history, and religion, and the more you read the more you'll wonder about the mind that could invent it, and the man that would keep working on it for so long without passing it on.There is a great love here and bit of it rubbs off on each of us while reading it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I really liked this book, but like other people, I was sorta brain-washed by Harry Potter. It got really hard to read when they were constantly on the road and describing every single bird that flew by, but by the end it was all worth it. I think you need to read the whole set to appreciate the story. After you read it all, it will hit you and what came to me was, &quot;Everyone should have a faithful friend through even the darkest evil, just like Sam.&quot; These books bring to light just what real friendship and brotherhood are. So, if you and considering reading the books, give them a chance and I am 99% sure there will be something there for you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Before reading this book, I had heard a lot of things about how good Lord of the Rings was. Before reading this book, I didn't realize how amazing this story could actually be. Fellowship of the Ring is the first step in the amazing Lord of the Rings novel (it has three parts, each containing two books for a total of six books).Though Fellowship of the Ring has less fighting and &quot;action&quot; in it as it's two sequels, I probably enjoyed it the most out of all three books. The way that the book begins, with Bilbo leaving his precious ring to his nephew Frodo; all the way to the end of the first part where Frodo is left with a difficult decision and Middle-Earth's fate in his hands. Frodo's character develops beautifully. At the beginning he's nothing more than a regular hobbit, Bilbo's nephew, son of Drogo. By the end, Frodo has been through so much that his character has been shaped into something that one wouldn't have imagined when he first left Hobbiton.

We would not have Dungeains &amp; Dragons, we would not have Robert Jordan. Tolkien was the one who perfected the fantasy epic, and these books are just as good now as they were when they were published. Someone posted a review that said the characters had no depth, they didn't like the poems, and they didn't understand why it spent a lot of time talking about Hobbit families. Well....someone obviously doesn't really understand what these books are all about. They complaied that the orcs were just evil and and that there were no twists. Well...Tolkien INVENTED Orcs...whay should he HAVE to twist them? And as for the characters having no depth.....that simply isn't true. Anyone with an imagination will enjoy this books. Anyone expecting a book to create an imagination for them needs to go study accounting and never have anything to do with art or fiction.

But LOTR has taken the first place of my heart. The amazing Lord of the Rings is my personal beloved book. I like it more than any other book of the trilogy, especially the chapter: The Bridge of Kazad-Dum, the climax of the book. The Lord of the Rings isn't just a book. It is a masterpiece, something historic. Tolkien is the Homer of the 20th Century and his &quot;Odyssey&quot; is the Lord of the Rings.

Tolkien is the best fantasy author ever to put a story down on paper. People who read fantasy and then call his work boring are obviously after a &quot;quick fix.&quot; In other words, they want light fantasy to kill a little time, they don't want an epic story to read. This is not light hearted fantasy. The Hobbit was, but this isn't. Tolkien basically defined the fantasy genre with these books. E.R. Eddison and one or two others are the only writers who had fantasy works before Tolkien (he was influenced to some degree by Eddison). I think the biggest problem for many of the people who don't like these books is that they are unable to identify with the main characters because they have no concept of self-sacrifice. The main characters in the book (Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf) are willing to sacrifice life, pleasure, power and their own personal goals so that others might live free and persue their desires. I think its possible that a me-first attitude is widespread in the world today which makes it difficult for people to understand the point of view of the characters in this story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"It's all here! This is the book that started it all! Jrr Tolkien was a brilliant professor of german philosophy and ancient languages. It took him over thirty years to write 'The Lord Of The Rings' based on his epic mythological poem &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, penned during WWI.In this classic epic, the Hobbit Frodo Baggins, relative of Bilbo Baggins who gets his own adventure in the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (which forms part of the back history to LOTR's) must travel from his home in the Shire (based on Oxfordshire where Tolkien lived) to the evil kingdom of Mordor to destroy the One Ring, a magical talisman created by Morgoth the Dark Lord. In the present Third Age, Morgoth's agent Sauron seeks the ring with the help of the corrupted wizard Saruman and his army of goblin-orcs. On his travels Frodo meets elves, dwarves, nature spirits, guardian-angels, fairies and heroes. His protector is Aragorn, disinherited heir to the throne of Gondor, destined to overthrow the mad pretender-king Denethor, who tries to burn his own city, like Nero. This books has all the whiz-bang special effects magic of the classic Grimms fairy tales, the trolls and unicorns you love to read about in Arthurian fantasy and the heraldic splendor of a medieval tapestry.

Fellowship begins amid the pastoral utopia of the Shire, as the venerable Bilbo Baggins, hero of The Hobbit, prepares to celebrate a particular milestone in his life, and from there the pace changes as dark dangers begin to appear in this quiet backwater, as they have long-since done in other lands of Middle Earth. Soon Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, finds himself, along with his beloved servant Samwise and two hobbit friends, Merry and Pippin, traveling toward Rivendell, a great elvin city. After surviving the journey to Rivendell, meeting the mysterious ranger Strider, and taking part in a council where the representatives of the mightiest of Middle Earth's peoples gather, the quartet of hobbits join the Company of the Ring, a dwarf, an elf, a human warrior, the ranger Strider (now revealed as Aragorn, the heir to the Kingdom of Gondor) and the wizard Gandalf, and set out on a perilous mission to cast into the fires of Mt. Doom, the One Ring, tool of Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, foe of all that is good in Middle Earth, and would-be enslaver via war and tyranny of all that lives. This is the novel wherein we learn the fate of Balin from The Hobbit, where we briefly encounter Tolkien's most enigmatic and whimsical, yet perhaps most powerful of all beings, Tom Bombadil, and where we enter the dreary mines of Moria, legendary dwarven city carved deep under a mountain chain, and read of the battle of Gandalf the Grey and the demon of fire and shadow, the Balrog.

Even within the journey, each character finds or learns something that helps his own life. The company changes and developes like Frodo's opinion and feelings toward the ring (and its destruction). My favorite characters were Sam, Frodo, and Strider. They were all responsible and loyal characters and I felt like I could trust them. Another wonderful thing was Tolkien's expressive language which he used to describe the setting. The woods and the mountains were pretty, yet scary when they needed to be. It was easy to see the darkness (of Mordor) and the happiness (of the olden days) through the chants and songs that were mixed into the story. They were fun to read but also helped me understand the basic plot. I also thought the plot was exciting; it kept me wondering what evil the company might run into. Another thing I looked for was how the company dealed with the evil chasing them. They faced their worst fear and horrible dangers. So it was interesting to see how they escaped such things, as the Orcs and the Black Riders."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the ring tells how Gandalf the Grey discovers that Frodo Baggins the hobbit has had the almost forgotten ring of Sauron - the one ring to rule them all, left to him by his relation Bilbo.

Buy it, read it"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I bought the digital audio of this when I saw the price and that it was unabridged. Unfortunately, I thought unabridged meant that it was actually the book....I didnt know that 'dramatized' meant that it was literally a dramatized VERSION of LOTR.My own fault for being uninformed, but the 'unabridged' advertisement didnt help. I was expecting a mere dramatization of the text...not an audio version of a sort of LOTR play...For purists like myself, this just wont do. If you are going to do something other than the actual book, you may as well watch the movies.For kids or non-purists, this is VERY well done.......however, be warned...if you listen to this before you challenge yourself to read the book, it could destroy your ability to appreciate the actual book, difficult as it is...to a greater extent than even seeing the movies without actually reading the book. If you know the basic plot of the book, all the twists and drama, before you read it, then you will probably never tackle the book even though it is unspeakably better than the films or any 'dramatized' version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I was led to believe the CD was unabridged by reviews, even though the product description is not very clear. I also was hoping for a single reader, as opposed to full cast (just a personal preference). Once again reviews reassured me there. I ordered it and got a 3.5 hour fully casted telling of the story. I listened for about 2 minutes before I realized it wasn't an unabridged reading, checked the back of the box, and sure enough it said it was abridged.I hate giving a 1 star, because I know the book, and it should be a 5 star. It seems there's a mistake where multiple products are sharing the same review base though.If you're new to lord of the rings and aren't sure if it's worth experiencing, it most definitely is, but that seems like a given with it's popularity. Be wary of ordering the CD from this page though, because it may be the abridged version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have to say that Tolkien is one of my top authors, period. The extensive work that he put into his literature is astounding. The man was a genius.I have to say, though, that the first 100 pages were hard to press through... and I couldn't get the characters from the movie out of my head. Anyway, after the first pages, the story really takes off.I literally could not put it down, which I don't do. I cannot wait to get the next two to read.Tolkien purposely made his stories without allegory, unlike his companion C.S.Lewis. He wanted people to draw many things from his stories, and not forced to comply to one story. However, there are a lot of lesson to be drawn from them.For instance, Borimere's state of weakness for betraying the fellowship that resulted from his personal lusts. However, he was redeemed and had his honor restored before his death."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Against all odds good overcomes evil in a struggle for middle Earth. Frodo is the ring bearer, he carries the all powerful ring. He is being hunted by the evil Sauramon, the creator of the ring. Frodo's goal is to destroy the ring in Mt. Doom, the only place the ring can be destroyed. The only problem is everyone is turning evil, and they are al after Frodo. Can Frodo and his companions make it to Mt Doom. In this book I had many favorite parts. My favorite part is when they are traveling through the mines of Moria. This is my favorite part because that would be really cool if the mines were real. There are many themes that you can get from this book. The theme I got is never give up on what you are trying to do. In the book Frodo is going to make it to Mt Doom at all costs. There are many things that I like about this book. The main thing that I like is how descriptive the author is. The author describes things so well that it makes a vivid picture in your head. The only thing that I would change about this book is the reading level. He should lower the reading level and make the book easier to read. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves to read a good adventure book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"After watching the movie makes the book easier to follow.

But I will add this to the pile of praise. You will start your magical journey inside Tolkien's world with this book. And you will finish it with The Return of the King. No waiting for book 12 to come and go. It seems many of today's fantasy writers have decided it takes 5-10 volumes to get their stories going. Tolkien will grab you from the start, entrance you throughout, and leave you breathless at the end. And there is an end. A very happy, heroic, satisfying end."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is it, boys and girls. The ultimate. Fantasy doesn't get any better than this. What more can be said about Tolkien and his work? The man practically invented what we think of as modern fantasy. Yes, yes... I know Tolkien took much of his material from older myths and legends. Trust me, I know; I wrote a 170 page paper on it. But that changes nothing. Without the earth-shattering publication of LOTR in the mid 20th century, fantasy today would be vastly different.Thus it is safe to say Tolkien is the father of modern fantasy. Yes, I love George R. R. Martin, and Robert Jordan, and Goodkind, and all those other guys too. They're great writers (for the most part). Often I just can't put their books down. But none of these writers can hold a candle to Tolkien. Pick your favorite fantasy work and I'll tell you how Tolkien influenced it. After reading LOTR you could probably do it yourself. Think of Tolkien as their (modern authors) muse. He is the master. The creator of the most intricate and detailed fantasy world ever conceived. For God's sake, the man invented his own language and put it in his books! If that's not dedication I don't know what is.Suffice to say, this book (and the other two comprosing LOTR) is incredible. Just amazing in every aspect. The pinnacle of high fantasy. And PLEASE, if you have seen the movie and are considering the book now, expect there to be discrepancies and additions in the writing. Peter Jackson did an excellent job directing the movies, but there is absolutely no way he could incorporate all of Tolkien's genius onto the big screen, even with several 3-4 hour long movies. This alone should give you an idea of the scope of the world Tolkien created."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is AWESOME!!!

Hats off to Mr. Rob Inglis for his exemplory narration. The voices are diverse and rich with character without being over-the-top. The narration perfectly captures the beauty, scale, and terror of Tolkien's world. The only small problem with the recording is how much Gandalf's voice changes from Book 1, when he is in the Shire, to Book 2, where he is featured prominently. Also, this recording is not only completely unabridged, but contains the original Foreword and Prologue to The Lord of the Rings.

The book was written by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is the first book of the trilogy.The book is about Frodo inheriting a magic ring from old Bilbo Baggins. Frodo left his home in the Shire with three other Hobbits Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They go to an inn and meet Strider who helps them on their quest. They go to Rivendell to seek the council of Elrond. After they get there, the four hobbits and Strider get some help. The new company is made of Strider, Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gandolf the Grey, Legolas, Borimier, and Gimli. Now they must go to Mount DOOM!This book would be best for anyone who likes swordplay and gore. You should read the Hobbit first. It will give you a good background of the Trilogy. The book gives you a lot more detail but you can&#65533;t get a good picture in your head.

I couldn't believe how much I was in the adventure, and how much I felt for the characters. J.R.R. Tolkien does a tremendous job of attracting readers of all ages. This book, along with the others, are loaded, from cover to cover, with adventure. It seems that as soon as the fellowship gets out of trouble, there's another group of orks, wizards, or any of these creatures that are described in great detail. This is one of only a couple of books that I actually felt and cared for what would happen to Frodo, Aragon, and the rest of the fellowship og the ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the novel The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring as an exercise for his profession in linguistics. The beautifully written adventure is about a man and an important task that befell him.The tale begins in a small hill in Hobbiton called Bag End where Bilbo and Frodo Baggins dwell. Frodo receives and heirloom from Bilbo that will put him on an adventure of a life time. He leaves Hobbiton with only one companion but ends up with eight, also meeting friends along the way. As Frodo passes through the land of Middle Earth, he meets great evil, but he also has his friends to help him through.As I read this book, I kept thinking about how the story was an epic battle between good and evil. Every day Americans face bad situations with drugs and violence. This is a great book for the adventurous at heart and people who want to travel to a distant land with out actually going anywhere. Tolkien uses great feeling and emotion when writing the elvish songs and chants. He also describes the landscape so well you can visualize it in your mind. In one of the songs, it talks about an elvish queen, Galadriel, and the land she rules, Lothlorien. \\"An elven-maid there was of old, a shining star by day: Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, her shoes of silver grey. A star was bound upon her brow, a light was on her hair, as sun upon the golden boughs, in fair Lorien the fair\\". I highly recommend this book to any one who loves adventures and I also would recommend that you would wait to read the series until about seventh grade. Over all on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 15!In conclusion, this story about a man and his adventure was excellently written and well thought out and a wonderful story for all who might take the time to read it.

Tolkien's storyline is rich, his characters are deep, and his world incredibly detailed. Therein lies the problem. While I do love the story, the books tend to drag. Tolkien had a great fondness for convoluted stories, thus you have a great amount of extraneous information. There are characters that have no real plot value (which is fine as long as you don't spend much time on them). He also spends too much time on character development at times. I don't like to spend so much time singing songs, reading poems, or perusing the menu...bring on the Nazgul!!! I think this book should be required reading for school writing courses however. At the very least it must be respected as the prototype work for the entire fantasy genre. As much as I love the story however, (I read the series at least once a year) this is one of the rare occations where I feel the movie was more entertaining than the book.

He seeks the Ring he forged 2,000 years ago, holding within the small golden band the power to enslave the world. All he must do is find it. This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves. What will Frodo do when this happens?

Tolkein. It is an awesome story about a hobbit that receives a ring from his Uncle Bilbo Baggins and has to leave the village because the ringwraiths are after a hobbit and especially the ring.As Frodo is on his journey he brings along other hobbits. After Frodo is attacked he has help and is taken somewhere. Before he goes any further, more people come along and helps him out. As they are traveling they go in a cave and fight all these goblins to get out. Now they are out on the field fighting and almost everyone dies for Frodo so he can get to the fire then travels down into the land of Shadow.The book is very long but is so exiting and fun to read. I think this because I can read this particular book without going away and not reading it again. It was hard to read were there was a lot going on but the book is so interesting it makes you want to read it.My favorite part of the book is were there is war in the beginning was started by a king who made the best ring out of the fire and people were fighting for it because it had power over all. When the war started there was a whole lot of rings that only the most powerful of all held. About 15 rings were on the earth. Before this time there was a story of Frodos uncle of how he got the ring. He passed it down to Frodo because his days were almost gone and he couldn't live with it because soon or later someone would find him and kill him.I found something very interesting about the book but I must not say. It happens all in just one day.

There were men who fought against Sauron to destroy his powerful and ominous empire. There was a great battle in Middle Earth. The battle was fought for the freedom of the men and other creatures for Middle Earth. During the battle, Isildur, heir of the throne of Gondor cut the Sauron's powerful ring from his hand.

But Tolkien wanted to write a myth on an epic scale, and he could not resist allowing his story to grow from a simple children's tale to the greatest fantasy saga of modern times.The transition is a little strange. The first half of this book is written in a tone similar to The Hobbit, so it seems somewhat juvinile. However, by the time we get to the chapter The Council of Elrond (about half-way through the book), the story becomes much more serious and adult in nature. And yet this works, because we see the great events depicted in the story through the eyes of the hobbits, who begin as innocent, sheltered country-folk, and end up as worldly adventurers. It is a story about growth. It is also about loss, death, and the passing of great beauty from the world.Fellowship is the first part of three, and in my opinion the least of the three. It certainly has its moments: The Mines of Moria chapter (particularly Gandalf the Wizard's confrontation with the monstrous Balrog) is fantastic, and Boromir's confrontation with Frodo over the Ring is extremely powerful. But I give Fellowship only four stars where the other parts in the trilogy will get five.Please read this book. If you've only seen the movies (which I loved, by the way), you only know part of the story. And although the books get better, you must start here, at the beginning. Better yet, start with The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Umm, hello? To people out there who said that they &quot;came to know every Elf, Tree, Stream, Ent, Rock, Dirt Clod, Hobbit. . .etc.&quot; and that they &quot;nearly danced a merry jig when Boromir died&quot; did you read another cheap copy of Tolkien or something? Are you talking about Terry Brooks and one of his characters of a similar name???Ok, I read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; before I ever read anything by Brooks. Well, actually, I read the first 80-some pages of &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; first but at that point I had already seen the movie &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; plus, I owned it and watched it many times in a row. I found Brooks' book to be TEDIOUS, BORING, A COPY and TOOOOOOOO DESCRITIVE. Then, after I saw &quot;The Return of the King&quot; I immediately started reading the LOTR trilogy. I LOVED IT! The descriptions were not boring AT ALL! Plus, may I remind the person who so mistakingly wrote the review I am referring to, THERE ARE NO ENTS IN THE FIRST BOOK!!! Merry and Pippin had not yet gotten separated from the rest of the Fellowship long enough to escape the Orcs and meet the Ents!Anyways, I found the descriptions all to be relevant, there was not a WORD out of place! Tolkien truly IS the Fantasy Master of anyone's time! I mean, why else would so many people try to copy him and end up doing such a poor job of it? It's disgusting. Truly, J.R.R. Tolkien brought us a new world of wonder, fear, hope and triumph and at a time when believing in success over a great evil was so important! Tolkien saw World War II, he saw a great darkness spreading over the land from East and West and he saw it ultimately conquered by people who had faith in Justice and Freedom.I found these books to be so entertaining, they really drew me in! I finished the first two within a matter of days. Unfortunately, Return of the King took longer because I had to start college again after Holiday break. However, the books are, believe it or not, better than the movies! I believe that if you have not read the books yet you should watch the movies first, then when you read the books you will be able to picture all the people and places even more clearly. Although Tolkien does a superb and INTERESTING job of detailed descriptions that are DEVOID of boredom!He was able to create a real and interesting dialogue between characters, and you can really sense the strong bonds of friendship between Sam and Frodo, along with Merry and Pippin and of course Gandalf. I felt that I knew these characters like old, trusty friends, the same feeling I had with all the people in C.S. Lewis' &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. I also liked that the trilogy was all about the continuing adventures of our friends and NOT their descendants! I have complaints with Brooks about that. (Three dark powers, three sets of &quot;friends&quot;, three hopeless quests: all carbon copies). With him, he stops when we get to know the characters and starts out again with their carbon copies in the form of descendants.With Tolkien, we know all of the people, their dialogue is always relevant, interesting and real, the descriptions are precise, to the point and necessary, AND the storyline is ORIGINAL!!! Tolkien wrote the Epic Adventure first, remember that, all you who think Tolkien is just yet another fantasy writer of a particular genre. When he wrote, HE was original, all the hordes of others came in the footsteps of Tolkien.Again, Tolkien had a flair for language; after all, he was a professor of that subject! He knew his stuff, and he was able to write wonderful relationships between people; he could make you feel the struggles and suffering; he brought a vivid world into my mind that has not disappeared! More people than not definitely know how good he was, judging from the fact that both a cartoon series and the recently done cinematic films have been made. Tell me where all of these are for Terry Brooks?The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is an epic for all time. It tells how the &quot;little people&quot; can triumph over seemingly insurmountable obstacles! These books should be treasured as a symbol of ultimate triumph! They are not just fantasy books, they are hope and courage for those who feel that hope had deserted them. They are encouragement for people of all Races, Ages and Denominations!

The movie follows this book well, but as always, this epic novel is much better than any flick.

No one knows where they are going or if they'll ever get back...I honestly believe this is an excellent book, the plot is amazing, the chararters and this fascinating fantasy world all come to life... friendship, forest, magic, mountains, everyday heroes, evil, rivers... just everything.Of course!, the book doesn't have a climax ending, for, it is just one third of a larger tale, and you will have to read the other two to know where it all ends.I loved this book, but I do believe it should be read by older kids, or by teenagers because of the many characters, and descriptions, and also because it is a bit long to keep young kids interested (I tried to read it, and gave up when I was 10). I would also recommend to read The Hobbit first, for apart from being an excellent book, it will help you understand how the ring came to the hands of Frodo."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is one of the greates books I have ever read. J.R.R. Tolkien sets all of the standards for fantasy writers; past, present, and furture. I think it is a great idea for a movie to be created. They say that it is going to cost around 130 million dollars, which is alot money, but they are going to come the closest to matching &quot;Star Wars&quot; since &quot;Titanic.&quot; I love the different characters and races that are presented, and for the most part how they are going to be casted. I reccomend to everbody in the world reading &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; because it one of the few books that you can totally get into and like. I would also like to that I think my British Literature teacher should read it especially because he won't be bored with it if he gives it a chance."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Love the author however I cannot stand books or movies that never end.

I'd say the movie left out about half of the book. The descriptions of the world's and its people are endless. That's provably why they were left out of the movie. Some of the descriptions went on for a about 10-12 pages and could get a little long at times. But there we'll worth it. The songs too seem to go on for a few pages. There great songs though. Tolkien is a master when it comes to the written word. Most times when I picked up the book to read for a little while I would end up reading for hrs. The book is 503 pages long and by the middle I found myself lost in an amazing adventure.I highly recommend this book to all ages.A nice bonus would be a j.r.r.Tolkien dictionary but I haven't found one yet.The next book in the series is the 2 towers which I plan to start reading tonight."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The only thing wrong with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is that you have to sit through Fellowship to get to it.

I FIRST READ THE HOBBIT WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I LOVED IT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTANCE OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND WAS DEPRIVED OF ITS RADIANCE FOR A FEW MORE YEARS. SINCE THEN I HAVE READ THE TRILLOGY THROUGH THREE TIMES (UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ONE OF THOSE READINGS WAS UNINTERUPTED). TOLKIEN IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY LARGEST INFLUENCES TO DATE AND I OWN THE TRILLOGY (THE BOXED SET, THE ORIGINAL SET- BOTH INCLUDING THE HOBBIT, AND THE CENTENARY EDITION IN ONE VOLUME AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK I OWN), THE SILMARILLION, UNFINISHED TALES, THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH, THE TOLKIEN COMPANION, AND VOLUMES 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, AND 11 OF THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH BY CHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN. MY MATERIAL ON MIDDLE EARTH TAKES UP NEARLY A FULL SHELF IN MY BOOK CASE AND I TREASURE IT. A PREVIOUS COMMENT IS CORRECT ABOUT TERRY BROOKS, HE CAN'T BEAT LotR, HE CAN'T AND NEVER WILL, FOR THAT MATTER NEITHER WILL ANYONE ELSE. TOLKIEN IS SIMPLY THE GOLD STANDARD OF FANTASY LITERATURE. NOT THAT THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER GOOD LITERATURE OUT THERE (I.E. ROBERT JORDANS WHEEL OF TIME SERIES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TOLKIEN INFLUENCED BUT IS RE-MOLDED ENOUGH TO BE UNIQUE). I NOTICE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CONFUSED COMPLEX AND HIGH WRITING WITH POOR AND RAMBLING WRITING- TOLKIEN DOES NOT RAMBLE, HE HAS A SLOW AND ELEGANT STYLE OF STORY TELLING AND ONE MUST PATIENT, FOR EVEN IF THEY FINISH THE BOOKS, THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE WRITING IF THEY RUSH IT. TOLKIENS GREATEST ACHIEVMENT IS NOT HIS NEAR-LIVING CHARACTERS OR HIS GRAND DEPICTION OF WORLD ALTERING BATTLES, NOR EVEN THE TORN ROMANCE BETWEEN ARAGORN AND ARWEN AND EOWYN, BUT IN THE FACT THAT HE HAS CREATED A GROUP OF GODS AND MYTHS AND LEGENDS (THE SILMARILLION IS MIDDLE EARTHS OWN GENESIS STORY). HE HAS CREATED NATIONS AND BLOODLINES WITH THE HISTORIES TO JUSTIFY THE FAMILIES'S NOBILITY. THE ELVES, THE DWARVES THE NUMENOREANS, THE MEN, AND THE SERVANTS OF SAURON ALL HAVE DEVISED AND DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY PUT INTO PRACTICE. HE HAS CREATED A WORLD WITH A BACKGROUND AS BELIEVABLE AS OUR OWN. THE WORLD WITHIN HIS PAGES SEEMS TO EXIST AS YOU READ THEM AND ONE SINCERELY WISHES THAT IT DID WHEN ONE REALIZES THAT IT DOES NOT. IF YOU READ IT FOLLOW SAMWISE GAMGEE, FOR I THINK HE IS THE TRUE HERO OF THE STORY AND I SOME TIMES CONTEMPLATE NAMING MY SON AFTER HIM, IF I EVER HAVE A SON. I WISH SOME DAY TOO THAT AN FAITHFUL MOVIE VERSION IS RELEASED, FOR FILMS ARE A GREAT WAY OF EXPOSING PEOPLE TO NEW THINGS. PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO CRITICISE TOLKIEN MASTERWORK SHOULD DO SO IN PRIVATE FOR THERE ARE SO MANY LEGIONS OF &quot;RABID FANATICS&quot; THAT THE FLAME MAIL WOOULD CRASH HIS COMPUTER FOR PUBLIC NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. IN MY OPINION, ANYBODY WHO CAN'T REALIZE THE GRANDUER THAT IS TOLKIEN SHOULD BE TOSSED TO SMAUG AS PUNISHMENT.

There are some chapters that you can't stop reading, and there are some that you just can't wait to be over. It takes perseverance to finish, but well worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I have read many of the reviews concerning this book and I have to agree with them. Tolkien is the master of them all. It may be rather difficult to read initially, but if you have the patience to do so you will be rewarded by its empathic prose that will guarantee a long rewarding read. Whoever wrote that Terry Brook's The Sword of Shannara is better should consider the fact that that novel is generally regarded by many as a rip-off of The Lord of the Rings. It's that influential. The only authors of this genre that would come close are David Eddings and Stephen Donaldson. But Tolkien is still the king of the pack."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I simply have to laugh at the one-star review below. To compare Tolkien to Brooks is like comparing Mozart's Don Giovanni to Cats. One is art, the other is light entertainment. Not that art can't be entertaining (I find the LoTR immensely so), or that there can't be art in entertainment (I very much enjoy Brooks' work myself, although I don't think he's a particularly brilliant writer), but they just aren't on the same level. Tolkien's writing is certainly difficult, which may put some readers off, but there's no question that this is one of the masterworks of fiction of this century. It spawned an entire genre of high fantasy, and few if any authors in the genre can claim to be uninfluenced by his work. The trilogy rewards multiple re-readings. Fans of Tolkien's work, I suggest doing some research into Old English literature (Beowulf, for example) -- this was Tolkien's area of study, and you can see the influences from that tradition in LoTR."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This trilogy is like Michael Jordan: the best there is, the best there ever will be.

The answer to both questions is, OH MY GOSH, YES! The movie is about as good an interpretation of the book as anyone could've hoped for - but even so, they still had to leave out a ton of stuff to make it into a manageable movie. People who've never read the book will wonder who Tom Bombadil is. What makes reading the books so essential is that no movie can capture the actual LANGUAGE of the novel. Whereas the movie is about action set-pieces, the book is more about a quest - meeting new people and traveling imaginary lands. Reading the book will only increase your appreciation of the film - and reading it first will only make it even better...having Gandalf, Frodo, and Rivendell in your mind and then seeing them brought to life is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book is enjoyed by millions. It has a good plot, interesting characters and it's recently been made into a hit motion picture. This book has a wonderful middle and an excellent ending. However I felt the beginning dragged. There are many drawn out and boring parts. It took me a while to get into the story and I'm not a dummy. This book is a good read. Just don't give up on the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There are several words to describe 'The Fellowship Of The Rings' yet few seem good enough. It is a true classic of its genre and will be remembered in many years to come. I have to admit that I was only tempted to read this book when I had seen the movie (which is also superb) and after a few reservations I had become hooked. The story is basically about the Ring of Power, controlled only by the evil lord Sauron. It is carried by a hobbit named Frodo who can only destroy it in the cracks on Mount Doom. On his perilous journey he is accompanied by a fellowship, including fellow hobbits Sam, Pippin and Merry, the wizard Gandalf, ranger Aragorn, warrior Boromir, elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli.Firstly, the flow of the story is fantastic, although there are some areas where it tends to drag. However, not only are the key points of the novel mesmerising but they are also well written and will absorb even the most cynical reader. What is perhaps most admirable though is the background detail that has gone into the making of 'The Fellowship Of The Rings'. Not only are there various areas in a world entirely created by Tolkien, but different races have different lanugages, lore and culture which adds to the already superb characterisation. The frienships and rifts built up as the book progresses are also realistic and at times genuinely touching. Moreover it is a stunning work of fiction that deserves to be read by anyone with a passion for adventure, fantasy or mystery."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"All who has seen the movie, they must read the book. It is incredible and full of adventure. There is a lot more to the book. I wished they had added another scene in the movie that was in the book. There is part in which the Company encounters a group of Wargs (wolfs), and that would have made an interesting scene in the movie. Anyway, the movie is basically about 3 1/2 hours long, but why not add another 30 minutes to it- Hey, its Lord of the Rings for crying out loud, it could've been 4 hours or even 6 hours (with everything else from the book in it) for all I care. But anyway, the movie war GREAT! and they did a excellent job of editing it. I was born in 1978, and pretty much grew up in the entertainment world of fantasy (ex. the Smurfs, the Hobbit, Legend, the Laberynth, etc.).

The characters are well described and played out throught the book. Their journey starts in the Shire where we meet Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Grey comes to Bilbo's 111th birthday party and Bilbo shares plans to leave the Shire to adventure again after his party is near over. Gandalf sees a change in his life long friend from the last time that he saw him. Bilbo mentions of a ring that he found on his last adventure that he took and also mentions that when he has the ring with him he doesnt feel a year older. When Gandalf trys to convince Bilbo to leave the ring behind when he leaves, Bilbo goes crazy. Gandalf finally convinces Bilbo that it is best to leave the ring to Frodo when he leaves. Frodo doesnt know how powerful the ring is until he is instructed to leave the Shire because it is not safe with him there. He travels with 3 other friends (who are all hobbits like him) to Bree to find the Prancing Pony Inn. There they meet Strider who is a trusted friend of Gandalf and protects the boys through the night from the Ring Wraiths. The Next day the party of five now leaves for Rivendell to reunite with Gandalf. On the way during one night the group is attacked by the Ring Wraiths and Frodo is injured by one. Arwen (the daughter of Elrond) is trusted by Strider to take Frodo ahead of the group to Rivendell because Frodo needs Elrond's treatment to stop his transformation into a Ring Wraith. Frodo arrives savely and recieves treatment, then soon learns of why he was attacked specifically. The Council of Elrond, which consists of a representitive of the nine areas of Middle Earth(with the exception of Mordor). Together they decide to have Frodo take the ring to Mordor to destroy it in the place where it was created. Now the Fellowship consisting of nine members, four hobbits, two warriors, an elf, a dwarf and a wizard, set out on their incredible journey across Middle Earth to take back the one ring of power. Through The Misty Mountains and the underlying caves, the Fellowship embarks on a journey that faces them against such foes as: Orcs, A Giant Octupuss, Ring Wraiths and a Balrog.

Don't come to &quot;Fellowship&quot; expecting high adventure and fast-paced action - an introduction is what it is, in every sense of the term. Tolkien spends a great deal of time in &quot;Fellowship&quot; to recapitulate the history of the Ring in his prequel novel, &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; In large parts of this volume, Tolkien goes to great lengths to introduce his readers to the various types of people found in Middle-earth; dwarves, elves, hobbits, and men.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; begins with Bilbo Baggins, the hero of &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; now an elderly recluse, pondering a movement out of the Shire, sixty years after his adventure. To the dismay of his most immediate family, the Sackville-Bagginses, Bilbo has made one of his nephews, Frodo Baggins, the sole heir of his estate and fortunes. The day Frodo comes of age, his 33rd birthday, the same day as Bilbo's 111th birthday, Bilbo orchestrates an insanely massive party, and disappears. Frodo's primary legacy from Bilbo is the Ring - about 20 years later, Gandalf, a mysterious and revered wizard, appears to inform Frodo that trouble is brewing in lands outside of the secluded Shire, and that the Ring is the cause. Three of his friends in tow, Frodo leaves the Shire, his quest, to make a party of nine, and attempt to destroy the Ring. The action of the novel concerns the formation of the party, the Company, or Fellowship of the Ring.The long, detailed histories and songs of each group of people in Middle-earth featured throughout &quot;Fellowship&quot; can seem needlessly intricate - however, I think them to be the most valuable and beautiful parts of &quot;Fellowship&quot; as an introduction. The poetry is simply, but variously metered and rhymed - their most important function, it seems, is to indicate largely pre-writing, oral cultures in Middle-earth. They provide us with speech patterns, characterizations, the values of cultural diversity and pride, and a sense of kinship and tradition in the world of Middle-earth that Tolkien creates. In &quot;Fellowship,&quot; characterization is mainly of this sort, providing an overview of the major players in the quest and how they are each effected by the rise of Sauron, the Dark Lord, and his evil desires.The introductory volume to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sets an excellent scene for the larger epic action to follow - we are exposed to a wealth of social and political issues that affect the diverse population of Middle-earth. The communal governance and barter economy of the Shire, the proud, but failing monarchies of the dwarves and fairies, and the collapsed monarchy of men present a complex web of social, economic, and military relationships between disparate peoples. It is absolutely fascinating to examine the ways in which relations between the various peoples grow, change, strengthen, fade, and reform during the novel, and especially within the Fellowship itself. For example, one of the most moving relationships in &quot;Fellowship&quot; and the epic as a whole is between Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf - two individuals from societies with a fraught history.This is quest-romance at its very best, and volumes 2 and 3 more than repay a close reading of &quot;Fellowship.&quot; There are many wonderful and captivating characters that populate the first volume - the cheerfully esoteric Tom Bombadil, the spectacularly magical Galadriel among them - who compensate for the first part's lack of intense action. I would reiterate one fact about &quot;Fellowship&quot; - it is the slowest moving part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - the fact that it covers 11 months of time is but one indication of its sprawl and attention to detail. The last 50 years of continuous reprintings of the Ring saga prove that despite Tolkien's lack of real stylistic elegance at times, and the pace of the first volume, that &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is both enjoyable and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was my favorite reading as a child, and so with the release of the movies I decided to reread the classics.The Fellowship of the Rings, although slow at times, is the timeless introduction to Frodo's ringbearing adventures. The story is truly wonderful and original, and I highly recommend this book to all!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"What can one say about the beginning to this series that hasn't already been said? I shall try to throw in MY two cents anyway.I have long considered Fantasy to be my all-time favorite genre, but have found pitifully few fantasy books that for me seemed to 'click' with what I was looking for. I was introduced to 'The Sword of Shannara' and for years felt that IT was the Bar to be judged by--despite the nay-sayers who claimed that Brooks had borrowed shamelessly from Tolkien's works--but I refuted that over and over again, even though I had as yet never once read anything written BY Tolkien. Oh I had tried. I felt that the style was too weird for me, and somewhat childish when I gave it a go some 20 years ago. I never once even attempted to realize that Tolkien had created a world based in part on his own studies of history, and imagined a complex society filled with different races, and from scratch he weaves a story that combined historical speech patterns with his own fantasy world...in short, something entirely different, original AND totally entertaining.To say that Tolkien was a genius doesn't even begin to describe his character and imaginiative abilities. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' begins the Lord of the Rings by bringing us to the Shire of Middle Earth with Bilbo Baggins celebrating his Eleventy-First birthday. Shortly thereafter, he disappears (literally) leaving most of what he has to Frodo. Before long the One Ring becomes the central point of what he has left to the poor unknowing Frodo. Gandalf the Wizard informs him of the historical nature of the One Ring and of the impending danger that awaits every living creature of Middle Earth because Sauron wants it back and the Ring itself WANTS to be found. Frodo quite obviously does not want this charge, but accepts it anyway, and before you know it, he is set upon with Samwise Gamgee on a quest that he believes will be a rather short adventure--and it turns out to be more, a LOT more. From being chased by the Black Riders and Orcs to seeing sights he had never imagined and putting his life on the line more than he had ever thought possible, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' begins what is arguably the grandest Fantasy adventure ever written. One cannot fully appreciate the detail of this magificent story without reading it yourself. I imagine the release of the 1st movie in the Trilogy will spurn an interest in these books that hasn't been seen in several decades--or more. If history is any indication, it should (the release of Dune in the 80's alone sold an additional million copies).ANY person who enjoys Hard Fantasy owes it to themselves to see why The Lord of the Rings is so beloved and why it IS the Bar by which ALL Fantasy is judged. As much as I enjoyed 'The Sword of Shannara', it doesn't even begin to reach the originality that Tolkien created so long ago...books that hold up now as good as they did when first published in the early 50's. Once you have immersed yourself into this amazingly creative world, you will feel cheated unless you finish the tales that continue in 'The Two Towers' and 'Return of the King' (I recommend buying all 3 together, or getting the 3-in-1 volume so you won't have to agonize over what happens next when you finish the first part).Finally, I feel as though I cheated myself all these years by not only ignoring these books, but by claiming that they were pale in comparison to Terry Brooks' 'Shannara' (which I still like, by the way). Do NOT make MY mistake. Pick these up and if nothing else, see the movie which will compell you to read the story to see how well the movie measures up (which by the way, is surprisingly good in Myopinion). Read and enjoy. This truly IS Fantasy at its all-time best."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a masterfully written tale of fantasy written for people of intelligence by a master of languages.

Tolkien was a humble man who was glad to make corrections in his books as each edition was published and many true fans like to look for changes from one edition to the next.

I understand that many of the ideas being conveyed are somewhat dated, and as one review said, overly conservative, but one must keep in mind that JRR was born in 1892, so the author probably didn't have much of a choice as to weather his writing style was conservative or not. on another note, the story should be considered a great classic for all readers to at least make an attempt at. although it is a long story, there is not a word that i would remove. this book makes use of imagery in all its forms, cleverly written so as to be detailed while not seeming too wordy. An excellent story combined with memorable characters makes this a fantistic book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I read the Lord of the Rings series after hearing that it was really bad - usually when people say books are bad it's because they're to dumb to understand its importance. I absolutely loved the entire book - it kept me occupied for over a month - I read it three times over. It has action, it has plot, it has many, many themes, and it has this undefinable aura which makes it unforgettable - quite unlike Harry Potter, who wasted his time whining to Sirius about his stupid, superficial scar.

There are wizards, hobbits, elves and more! And Christians dont have to worry about sorcery either! YAY!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"For most of the book I greatly enjoyed it. There were times it made me feel like a kid again. Tolkien's characters are all well developed. ontop of that middle earth is very well mapped out. My problem with the book is it's more of one giant book broken down in to three parts. After reading the fellowship there is no resolution. the last 100 pages are fairly uneventful. The beginning of the two towers should have been the ending the fellowship. There could than have been a cliif-hanger ending. When the movie comes out the films visuals will no doubt be it's strong suit,but the ending is weak and will have trouble bringing back people to buy tickets."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tolkien's masterful writing not only tells you a story but also practically takes you to the world in which he created: Middle-earth.In exploring his first book of the LOR series, I really noticed how much care he put into creating his characters and blending them into the most realistic world I have ever seen in a fantasy novel. This book gave me many sleepless nights and had an end that made me itch to read the next book. It's no wonder why the LOR series has been a classic for many decades now."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I &amp; II, Lost Tales (all volumes)). SF/fantasy writers today could learn something from this astounding amount of preparation. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There's a plethora of reviews below mine (this is a classic after all) so I won't bother going over the story or taking up a lot of space with my comments. I will say this: I enjoyed this story a lot more now as an adult than I did back in grade school. I think this is because Tolkien focuses more on the characters' minds and their interpersonal (or interhobbit) relations than on simple swordfighting and stuff. The book concentrates on several human themes, most importantly being power and greed. In the beginning when Bilbo doesn't want to give up his Ring, we can understand why. We also understand how the Ring's evil power lead to the downfall of Gollumn. (The Ring kind of reminded me of the corrupting influence of hard drugs, drinking, gambling, and other social vices). The theme of despair is a big part of the story. When the hobbits reluctantly enter the Mines to try to cut through the mountain range you can feel their fear. The scene where they have to let one of their ponies go is a haunting one (&quot;Poor old Bill!&quot; is a line I'll remember) and you can really sympathize with these characters because they're not superhuman heros; they're everyday people (well, hobbits) in a tough situation. The ending is extremely powerful where Frodo decides he must take the corrupting Ring away from his compatriots and strike out on his own. When Sam catches up to him and heads off on this seemingly suicidal mission simply because he trusts his friend Frodo so much, it's a very moving scene.I'd like to comment that I read Stephen Donaldson's 1st &quot;Thomas Covenent&quot; trilogy (Lord Foul's Bane et al) and I liked them as much as I liked these books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"My girlfriend was reading Harry Potter, heh ... and she thought I should read it too. I told her that if I was going to go reading any fantasy books I owe it to myself and the world at large to read Lord of the Rings! (Great way to get out of that one, eh?) Having read the Hobit in school (I reckon 8th grade or so - it was long ago) I was vaguely familiar with the plot. Criticisms I've heard I can sometimes concur with, it does get rather long winded with detail descriptions of meals that, if you took all reference to eating out of all six books (two in each part) could probably trim it down a few hundred pages. The other complaint is it often goes into nonsense poetry and prose in &quot;elven&quot; tongues, etc. Well, I don't read Elven so well and I find it difficult to even attempt reading such. These things aside the series is absolutely brilliant. Often just when you are sure you know what's coming next Tolkien will spring a suprise on you and twist and turn the events to the unexpected. It is one of the most remarkable fantasy books I have ever read and it is well worth taking the time to read. You must not simply buy Fellowship and not expect to commit to reading the other two parts: Two Towers and Return of the King. Fellowship does a great job of setting up the characters and you'll almost feel that the fellowship are all personal friends of yours by the time you make it to the second book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Literature for children, as opposed to children's books, is a work of serious fantasy where a world is created in imagination and then flowers from the author's craft. In both craft and imagination, no one rivals Tolkien. It isn't the story that captivates you, but how could it not, Sauron, perverter of beauty and good, unleashes the 9 Ring Wraiths to hunt down the Ring of Power. Who has the ring ? An innocent hobbit, Frodo, who has known nothing but comfort and love in the idyllic country of the Shire. Frodo inherits the ring from Uncle Bilbo who discovered the ring in the Mines of Moria while seeking a dragon's hoard. Frodo's introduction to the struggle between Good and Evil and his harrowing escapes from from the mounted Ring Wraiths is your introduction to the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. Tolkien's love of the mythology of Middle Earth which he spent a lifetime perfecting is inspiring and that is what makes it great.If you want a book that will last a lifetime, buy this one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Most people coming to this review already have a good idea what the story is all about from either other readers or people who have seen the movies made from this three part story. This is not a trilogy the three-part story so you can buy the individual books but it might be prudent to buy all three at the same time or a combined volume.The reason I say buy the complete \\"Lord of the Rings\\" now is that you will just be picking up speed and getting everything straight in your mind and you will come to the end of this volume. Talk about a cliffhanger. This animal leaves you with several.Even though the adventure takes place six years after the adventures in Tolkien's \\"the Hobbit or There and Back Again\\", the writing style is also a little more in-depth.I am not going to paraphrase the story. J.R.R. Tolkien himself tells you what you need to know in the prolog.Many people have read things into this story thinking it was maybe an allegory of things like the bomb; but Tolkien says himself that this is not an allegory.Tolkien creates a rich world in which you the reader will feel you are part of the adventure. If you've only seen the movies than you've only seen a synopsis and you will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"this book is... beautiful. incredibly well-written and vivid. it brought back my imagination. read this book, and read the entire wonderful trilogy. afterwards, you will have wonderful things to muse on as your mind will be lifted from the mundane to the gorgeous world and characters Tolkien has created."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Wow! What an amazing book. Mr. Tolkien is an amazing writer. The vividness of his world is utterly unbeleivable. When reading any of his works, I feel as if I am seeing and feeling exactly what the main character is seeing or feeling whether it be frightened or happy. The main character in this case is the hobbit, Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins, the lovable main character in the Hobbit. Frodo is heir to the ring of power and knows the terrible ringwraiths were searching for him to steal the ring which would enable the dark lord Sauron to destroy all that was good in the Middle-Earth. His journey is full of sights and adventures, both good and bad. I would like to journey to the Middle-Earth after reading this magnificent book. I admit that it is slow in some places but it is worth the time and it will get you reading the whole trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I just finished this book last night. It is incredible! The characterization is amazing, and the setting is so wonderfully convincing that I felt amazed when I would look up and see my TV across the living room instead of Middle Earth.That being said, I did not find that the tale was as tightly woven as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and it did, indeed, drag in parts.
