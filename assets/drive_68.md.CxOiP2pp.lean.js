La tumba del relampago (La Creacion literaria) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Scorza concludes his pentalogy initiated with \\"Redoble por Rancas\\" with this superb novel. Book after book of that series, the drama of insurrections in Peruvian indigenous communities unfolds in the Central Andes. In a cycle of optimism and tragedy every insurrection against the despotic domination is mercilessly crushed. Ominous, huge like the Andes the shadow of a powerful mining corporation remains as the backdrop for most of the novel until the end when it engulfs in blood and death the main characters. Scorza paints the struggle of the Peruvian peasants with a master's brush. Incredibly exquisite subordinate tales intertwined with the central thread of the story to give it a deeper meaning: the story of Maca Albornoz and her forbidden love for his brother, prophecies announced in a weaving (parallel to The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury), the honest lawyer Genaro Ledesma sent to study by the communities, etc. Yet, the novel also relates the constant lack of vision of leftist politicians who fail to evolve out of their dogmas to learn from social movements as they unfold with originality and audacity. To reinforce how involved the author was in the struggle for social justice in his own country he includes himself into the story. \\"La Tumba del Rel&aacute;mpago\\" is not only a denunciation of the abuses committed by transnational corporations and their caporals, i. e. corrupt local officers, but also of the shortsightedness and selfishness of some seemingly progressive militants. Then the universality of Scorza's tale becomes more relevant if one compares those Andean communities with Chiapas. Just change the geography but the exploitation and the ever-present bully remain the same."},{"Title":"Piano Stylings of the Great Standards (Volume 1: Standards)","review":"The arrangements are not technically difficult, but they have lots of accidentals and various rhythms that require close and careful reading.

There is so much I could write, but do to space and this not being the forum for all I could say - I will not. But I will say this, I have not read the book completely, I have read sample chapters of it on the R.A. Coombes website. I want you to know that I do not agree with this book. I want to encourage those of you interested in prophecy and where we are headed to get a Dake's Bible and see all of his notes using scriptures to back It'self up.This man's study was an exhausting one of over 40 years of his life. Please study especially the books of Daniel, chapter seven and on, and the book of Revelation. Awesome notes with original language explanations, etc... Also if you can find a book by him, which I have titled: \\"God's Plan For Man\\" by Dake. His full name is: Rev. Finis Jennings Dake This book is an awesome study of end time prophecies, and all types of other subjects for one who is studying the Word of God.(...) Kim is a Prophet of our day, and has prophecied accurately about 911 and many other things. His prophecies show a changing of the guard for the United States and shows that America is heading for a massive healing and revival and turning back to God (as it should be). Also you can watch Kim Clement on TBN. His Ministry info can tell you all of that.Also, last night after I found out about this book I began studying about Washington on the Internet and there are many monuments that have the Bible, and Moses, and the Ten Commandments and Scripture as part of their design. (...)I'd also like to point out, for those of you who will probably accuse me of this; I put no human man or human prophecy above God's Word. But I'll tell you this, when I have prayed and asked God for guidance and help He has always provided it. I was one who let this false junk get into my brain and make me almost have a breakdown until I sought God for the Truth and realized the truth was there all along. It angers me to know that there are people out there making money off of scaring the public to death, and twisting God's Word. I don't worry about gold dust, I don't worry about biometric chips, I don't worry about other's claims of false revivals, and I don't worry about America going to hell in a handbasket (because it won't). I put God's Word above anything, you don't need any other book but that one, and the help of the Holy Spirit to get the truth. But I thank God for the gift he gave men like Dake, and to Kim Clement and many like them. They are voices in our world today, and the truth is there but the devil in all of his prideful self is of course trying to scream louder and above what the truth is; because he wants to try and drowned out the truth so that you cannot hear. So many writers today are writing these \\"fictional\\" books based (supposedly) on Biblical scripture (I do not buy this). The are selling us fear, don't buy into it people. Seek the Truth. There is a day coming when the Bible prophecies about end times will be fulfilled, I believe that with all my heart, but what I do not believe is that it will happen the way many are saying it will.You can find this in the Word of God, in the Dake's notes, and in prophecies and teachings by Kim Clement, as well as others. Please read them, hear them. It's to your benefit. There are so many books and websites out there that put literal FEAR in the hearts of people. But I tell you this, the Word of God says I haven't given you a spirit of fear, but a spirit of love and of a sound mind. The Bible also says God is not the Author of confussion, and some of these goofy websites and books reach so far they become very confussing. I strongly encourage anyone who seeks the Truth to turn to the Word of God for what it actually says and back it up with help and aid on study with the Dake's Bible and/or any other Dake books. Again, the Kim Clement website. But most of all, pray and ask God - because that is what I have done and He has led me into finding the help and peace I have needed to know those that are His are in His hands. God bless you as you reach out to Him for the answers.P.S. I had to give this book one star to get my review on here, but really I give it none. And I sure hope and pray that Amazon will post my review as I have a right just as all others to voice what I believe in, and this book is not something I believe in."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"A must read for anyone interested in Biblical Prophecy and end times events!!

I do not have to read the book to know that the author is absolutely correct in that America is Mystery Babylon the Great. I know it is true without a doubt, because in April 1993 I was given a prophetic word by the Holy Spirit. America shall be totally destroyed. Her fate is sealed. The word that I was given is: \\"The abortions, the blatant homosexuality, what they're teaching the little children in the schools. It's gone too far, there's no stopping it. America is Sodom and Gomorrah. Judgment is going to come down on America.\\" It was not until 2008 that I found in the Old Testament the identity of Mystery Babylon the Great. It is America. It is all there, search and you will find it. It is clearly all there; the Lord is very descriptive. I also found in the Old Testament, that the Lord God says Babylon the Great will burn as Sodom and Gomorrah! When I found that I was shocked. It confirmed the word I had been given in April 1993.The Lord is marvelous, His word is without error. I smile when I think why the Lord God calls End Time Babylon the Great, \\"MYSTERY\\". Down through the ages, thousands of years, scholars would never be able to identify Babylon the Great, because she would not even exist until the Time of the End, therefore She would remain a MYSTERY until the last days when she would arise to be the \\"Hammer of the whole earth\\" and the last and youngest nation, as Scripture says.The following are just a couple of Scriptures I found, however, there are many more of America/Babylon. End Time \\"Babylon the Great\\" is a nation and the final, last, of the great nations, and she has a mother. Jeremiah 50:12 \\"Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost [final, last] of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.\\" End Time Mystery Babylon is the Final, Last, great nation and she has a mother. Which nation has a mother? America has a mother--ENGLAND.Mystery Babylon the Great has the symbol of the EAGLE, and the prophets Obadiah and Jeremiah both say, Babylon mounts up to heaven. Obadiah further says, SHE BUILDS HER NEST AMONG THE STARS. (America's space program)Jeremiah 51:53 \\"Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.\\" Obadiah 1:4 \\"Though thou exalt thyself as the EAGLE, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.\\"It was America who landed on the moon in \\"The Eagle\\"!\\"VOICE FROM MOON: THE EAGLE HAS LANDED\\" (1969) Dictionary of American HistoryThe Holy Scriptures says Babylon the Great is represented as a woman. Which nation has the symbol of a woman? America - The Statue of Liberty, most famous graven image in the world. And who REALLY is the Statue of Liberty? Actually she was designed as Ishtar, the goddess of ancient Babylon, Nimrods Babylon, and one of her titles is, the Mother of Prostitutes. The Mother of Prostitues or the Mother of Harlots (same thing) stands in NY harbour, and the City of Babylon, Long Island, is directly behind her. God, in the Book of Revelation, calls Mystery, Babylon the Great the Mother of Harlots.There are many, many, Scriptures describing Babylon the Great and only America fulfills them all.

That alone tells me something about the author. And when I read it my suspicions were confirmed. R A Coombes' &quot;research&quot; consists of simply taking every word in the applicable portions of scripture, then, by using several different lexicons, he finds every possible meaning for the Hebrew or Greek words and manipulates them to fit his somewhat far out theories. His jumps of logic are embarrassing. I'm not a scholar, but I can see the difference between a work of quality and the writings of a fanatic who desperately needs to prove his ideas despite the obvious hurdles of truth and logic. Sorry.

The end-time Babylon reigns economically over the world. It is on ocean fronts. It is an economic world super-power. And it is a military world super-power [she fears no one-chap 18] (which Rome is neither today or is unlikely to ever be in the future).As far as the word, \\"city\\" used here, it is from a Greek word, \\"polis\\" - a town, probably from the word, \\"polemos - to bustle\\" implying a busy place of commerce also indicating strength as in warfare.Using a word such as city (in a vision) to designate the world-wide influence of the end-time Babylon does not deny that the world power is spread over a much wider area as Chapter 18 describes.It is clear that this world-power impacts the entire world through its economic and military strength."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"Good reading and fascinating study but I would recommend taking God's Word at face value. Read The Rise of Babylon by Dr. Charles Dyer for a look at what the BIBLE says about this ancient city of paganism and sin"},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"When I first read the book, my initial thoughts were, \\"Wow! This book really sounds like the truth!\\" However, the initial thoughts wore off and I began think, \\"This book isn't true at all!\\" Why would John (the writer of the book of Revelation in the New Testament) and some of the Old Testament prophets write about America as the future Babylon when America wasn't even known then? R.A. Coombes says America was a part of the ancient Babylonian Empire and that there's evidence (ancient artifacts) to prove it. Really? Where's the evidence?! I have yet to see it. Like all other nations, God will judge America for her sins but there's no reference to America at all in the Bible. The fact that America is absent speaks volumes. The silence of America is deafening. America doesn't play a big role in the end times as evidenced by no references in the Bible. I know some reviewers here have stated Coombes' book is solidly researched. It's just the opposite; the book is full of sloppy research and many of his statements are home-made. There are far better books out there than this one. Mark Hitchcock is a much better author on telling you what could happen to America."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"Beware of the claims the author makes of \\"research\\" and \\"study.\\" This is not a scholarly work. To suggest that scholars will find anything of value here is nonsense. This work would not earn a passing grade in a freshman class, let alone at a thesis level. To say that the conclusions are flawed is an understatement. The author breaks almost every rule of scholarly analysis and runs the risk of appearing deliberately deceptive. I would be very interested to see this author's CV.Anyone familiar with the Apocalypse will see a fatal flaw to the author's conclusion that America is Babylon. In Chapter 17 and verse 18 of the prophecy it is written: \\"And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.&quot; Here the prophet reveals the elements of a vision that uses symbolism to describe Babylon. As can plainly be seen, Babylon is described as a \\"great city.\\" In Greek it is roughly translated \\"megas polis\\" or \\"megapolis.\\" The Greek for nation is \\"ethnos.\\" Just a preliminary investigation shows that the author is in error when he suggests that America is Babylon since America is a nation and not a city.Furthermore, in this same sentence the city is described as having \\"dominion over kings of the earth.\\" No American city ever had control over kings. The American colonies were once ruled by a King but opted for independence from the Monarchy. Indeed the Pope is the only figure in modern history who claimed and exercised authority over kings.Students of antiquity are only too familiar with Rome being known as the City on Seven Hills. Despite the author's incessant protestations, the Greek word used for \\"mountains\\" here is most certainly also used for \\"hills.\\" To reject Rome as the location of Babylon on the basis of such poorly constructed semantics is what is called \\"eisegesis.\\" It is forcing a meaning on to the scripture rather than the scholarly pursuit of exegesis, which is extracting the meaning from the scripture. As it is written: (Revelation 17:9) \\"This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.\\" Clearly Babylon sits on seven mountains or hills. Rome sits on seven hills. Draw your own conclusions.Although this is not the venue to take apart the author's book piece by piece, it should be clear, based on the limited material covered, that at the very least, it is impossible for America to conform to the description set forth in scripture. Furthermore, based upon this small examination, it becomes clear that the ancient writer was pointing to Rome when he described Babylon. The early Christian writers needed to take great care when dealing with such sensitive issues as the Roman government. The leadership of Rome would not look with favor at being called a \\"harlot\\" just as the modern church hierarchy finds this title less than flattering.In conclusion, while people may read whatever interests them, this book will clearly be a disappointment if you are looking for a scholarly work. Indeed, if you are seeking an intelligent discussion about the subject at hand, you will be disappointed. However, if you enjoy convoluted logic, poor editing, pedestrian prose and a desire to be deceived, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"This book was nothing more than a collection of far-fetched garble.

I bought the book to see how stupid one person who calls himself an author could be, and sure enough... he's THAT stupid. My recommendation is read ANYTHING but this book. Really! It's that far off base!"},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"I am amazed at how a book can trigger such hatred and animosity by those who simply cannot accept its conclusions. Numerous reviews here and elsewhere on the internet and on radio talk shows about this subject stirs up a hornet's nest of emotions.America, The Babylon is praised by some as the epitomy of scholarly research and ripped by others as the absolute antithesis of scholarship. How can this be? How can one book generate such exactly extremely emotional and opposite opinions especially the negative emotions that come from patriotic Americans who wear blinders and refuse to see unpleasant facts.How can this be? Because the book and its author have presented information that claims America is about to be destroyed by God because America is the most evil nation in human history. These assertions are made from the original ancient Biblical writings that contained precise written predictions given by God.Those who claim to be true, American patriots will automatically reject such a notion. If GOD Himself came down and made such a claim face-to-face, then the negative reviewers of this book that are found here would also reject God's face-to-face assertion and they would find any kind of an excuse to do so.Meanwhile, the reviewers who have positively reviewed the book have done so on the basis of the material presented in the book. Some state their case more eloquently than others, but both sides are quite emotional in this regard. What is it about this book that triggers such emotional reactions? Upbringing?I found the book to be very scholarly with multiples of references to ancient Hebrew and Greek words and their ancient definitions. More than that though, the author uses Strong's numbering system so that anyone can verify much of the author's claims but albeit not all of them because some reference works are too advanced for even Strongs. Now this aspect is extremely scholastic and clearly the negative reviewers who claim the author is an idiot and not scholastic, merely reveal their own extreme biases. Such reactions underscore the fallacious arguments of these emotionally vitriolic critics.There are some who even deride the author's writing style. Well there's nothing like attacking a \\"straw man\\" -- like Hitler and his cronies would do. Well, its an easy way to try and win an argument I suppose but it doesn't affect the truth of the matter at all. Such reviews though fail to give a good picture of what a reader should expect to discover in the book.America, The Babylon provides a plethora of documented assertions that point to America's coming destruction by Divine decree. It uses the ancient Old Testament Hebrew prophetic texts and New Testament Greek prophetic texts to expose the hidden mystery behind the term \\"mystery Babylon.\\"The author does a decent job in making his case. It would be better if the typesetting style had used actual Hebrew and Greek letters instead of an English equivalent. That's the only real criticism that I find valid, albeit a minor one about the book. Oh there are a few minor editing issues missed or created in typesetting perhaps, but the content of the material itself is quite compelling and well documented but its not the conclusion that I wanted to read. Too bad but the truth is not what I/We want it to be but rather the truth is what it is regardless of whether we like it or not. I'd really like to think America is not Babylon.The evidence in this book has proven otherwise to me. It dragged me screaming and kicking to that conclusion. Will it drag you to that conclusion or will you drag yourself to the opposite conclusion. No matter which way you go, your fingernails will be clawing at the factual ground trying to get away from the haunting facts found in this book.Warning: If you consider yourself to be a \\"true\\" American patriotic Christian with a \\"love it or leave it\\" mentality then this book will be too disturbing for you to read. Save your money and don't buy it. You're too biased to rationally approach the book.If you still think its a book you would like to have, it is out of print but maybe one of those negative reviewers will sell you their copy. Amazingly no one wants to part with a copy and there must be a lot out there because its fairly high ranked at Amazon.com out of say 6 million books handled. It has been out of print for a couple of years, yet most people do not wish to part with their copy. Yet Amazon.com apparently has sold bunches, not to mention in bookstores around the country.But no one is selling their copy.I give it 5 stars out of 5 just because of the material itself and not because of stylistic or typesetting complaints."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"Until I read this book I staunchly refuted anyone who dared to besmirch our beloved America. But that all changed when I found out that our nation was clearly founded on Freemasonry as laid out in &quot;America the Babylon&quot;. Coombes shows how most of our cherished icons, such as the Statue of Liberty, Capital building, our dollar bill and even the way Washington DC is laid out is Masonic in origin--which itself has its origins in Babylonian symbolism. He also shows how the Babylonian religion is the basis of all other pagan religions and how the names of the god's changed but not their main elements. This is not one of those books you should lay down and read. If you want to thoroughly get a grasp on this book you will need to sit at a table with a concordance, or lexicon, in one hand and your Bible in the other to check everything Coombes says like a good Burean. &quot;America the Babylon&quot; is actually an in-depth Bible study that digs into the original languages and gives us 21st century meanings to many of the words relating to Mystery Babylon. It is the meaning of these words that clearly affects which country is being spoken of in these passages. Richard Coombes shows how the prophecies in the Old Testament regarding the future destruction of Babylon are tied to similar prophecies in Revelation and were never fulfilled in the past nor can they be fulfilled by Rome or Iraq or any other entity in the present except for America. He also shows how all these scriptures clearly lay out the fact that Mystery Babylon is not only a city, but a country as well. The 66 question Babylon Quiz in the back of the book should belay any doubts that any other country but America qualifies for the distinction of being Mystery Babylon. This book has some problems with grammar and editing but the phenomenal amount of research that went into this book far outweighs these insignificant details.ELE"},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"There hasn't been a book like this since &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth.&quot; That is the magnitude of this book. From one scholar to another my hat goes off to this author. It's a great read that reaches out to not only the scholar but to the average reader so that all can understand. Yet it provides the data for serious researchers to follow up in their own research. Those who stubbornly cling to the notion that Mystery Babylon's identity is Rome, or Iraq, or the Catholic Church or the UN are left gasping for breath as this book's data just destroys the other theories claims. It is an exhaustive presentation of all the facts. But those facts are analyzed within the context of the ancient Hebrew and Greek texts of scripture. The author's analysis is truly without parallel on these issues. He seems to have left no stone unturned. Unquestionably, America is Mystery Babylon. If the scriptures aren't enough for the reader, the author presents empirical support showing extensive Babylonian roots in America's very beginnings. He presents the facts we didn't learn in school. Like the US Capitol building (where our lawmakers meet) is a replica of the Roman Pantheon who had in turn replicated the Babylonian Pantheon! The author documents this with Internet web links to the US Library of Congress website. Then there's the stunning revelation that the Statue of Liberty and also the Statue of Freedom were representations of the Babylonian chief goddess Ishtar who was called the Mother of Harlots, just like Revelation 17:4-5 describes. But there's a lot more. This book is an eye-opener but not all want to have their eyes opened. If the prospective buyer has an unbiased viewpoint he will conclude that Mystery Babylon is America just as the book demonstrates. The book is bound to created further controversy on the subject despite its ironclad documentation. Why? People will reject out of hand what they refuse to accept. This is one scholar who is glad that this book is out for public consumption. It is much needed."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"Before Reading This Book I Had Suspicions That\\"Babylon The Great\\" That \\"Entity\\" That loomed LargerThan Life In The Prophecies of The Prophets CouldBe None Other Than The Country Who DominatesThis Last century Both economically & Culturally,This Book \\"Merely\\" Confirmed My beliefs...It Doesn'ttake a rocket scientist to figure out thedescriptions of jeremiah 50-51,,,only one nationraises all the flags, and it certainly isnot modern Iraq nor Uganda...It Is Us !!!"},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"Are you interested in history, ufos, The Bible, prophesey, or the unexplained? If you are interested in any one of these, then America, the Babylon should be by your reading lamp. Mr. Coombes has written a book that offers an engrossing narrative that you will find hard to put down. The writer produces astounding evidence in support of what many readers may find to be incredible conclusions about what has happened, what is happening, and what is yet to come. Students of history will be interested in the author's interpretation (supported with facts) of several historical events. Those readers interested in ufos, cosmic events, and unusual phenomena will find connections to historic and future events that will shed new light on whatever beliefs the readers may have previously held. The author has given serious and amateur students of The Bible and prophesey some new fat to chew. Those of faith, and those needing it, will both be praising Mr. Coombes work after they read this book."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"It seems as if Richard Coombes did a very extensive research into that topic.

If you have not been satisfied with the explanations of Babylon until yet - take this book. And if you ever wondered where in the biblical world does such an important country as America fit in - take this book. But I warn you - this book will broaden your horizon.

While reading the Bible, I came to the same conclusion and found it so disturbing that I pushed the thought aside. Besides, I thought, I had never heard any minister say such things. It's very unsettling then to read that this author has come to the same conclusion (only he was smart and wrote a book). I will read this book with more than just idle curiosity."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"I read this book years ago when it was free online - don't know if it still is. Also, Youtube has Coombes speaking on the Prophecy Club (a place with a lot of dubious speakers, but sometimes very good speakers, mho).He uses Scriptures, history and much else in a concise and detailed way to make his points. I would disagree in one point. He says Rome is not Babylon, but in a sense it is while America is also. Look up pictures of some of the leaders of the U.S. with the Pope, like the Clintons and Bush.When do you ever see them wearing all black? (Ditto the Queen of England & others, as this example is true for her & other world leaders also.) Yet when they have a meeting with the Pope they wear all black in contrast to his white. This is part of the magical thinking of the NWO - the head honcho wears black and the underlings (even the Queen is one compared to him!) wear black.So, some say Rome is running America. That would make both Rome (which never stopped ruling, contrary to what Coombes says, but only morphed into the mostly pagan RCC) and America, and really much of the leadership of the world, to be Babylon."},{"Title":"America, The Babylon : America's Destiny Foretold in Biblical Prophecy","review":"If you've always believed that Mystery Babylon is Rome or the re-built Babylon of Iraq, you need to read Coombes' book. He makes it clear that the &quot;city&quot; of Babylon mentioned in prophecy is what we would call a &quot;nation&quot; in today's terminology.

You may enjoy this book if you're interested in the period (America from the teens to the 30s), but it's mostly for those who have read Lardner's fiction and nonfiction and want to know more. I'd recommend you read it alongside the memoir written by his son Ring, Jr: The Lardners: A Family Remembered. Both books are wonderful, entertaining tributes to a great American writer."},{"Title":"Ring: A Biography of Ring Lardner","review":"Ring Lardner began his career as a sports journalist, writing mostly about BASEBALL. He had his first literary success with stories about a BASEBALL player. There is a good case to be made that BASEBALL events like the Black Sox Scandal greatly affected his world view. So guess what? Any biography of Ring Lardner is going to have a lot of stuff about BASEBALL in it! Kind of like a biography of George Patton might mention the army here and there.Jonathan Yardley sets the stage with a 38 page section about baseball as Lardner knew it. If you're allergic to baseball you can skip this part. The other 362 pages of text mention baseball no more than is necessary to tell Ring's story. Mostly this is an affectionate, critically insightful, well written biography of a vastly influential and still funny American writer who is sadly neglected today. Includes a decent sampling of Ring's newspaper journalism and personal letters."},{"Title":"Ring: A Biography of Ring Lardner","review":"I am familiar with Ring Lardner's interest in baseball, and his disappointment in the game following the fixed 1919 World Series by \\"his\\" Chicago White Sox. Unlike a previous reviewer I don't feel there is an overemphasis on baseball once the 1920s began. Sure the game is mentioned periodically, but examples are given of his writing on various subjects. In particular I found his skill on nonsensical writing to be entertaining. Lardner, like so many other writers who spent too much time in watering holes, destroyed his health with alcohol and tobacco and died in 1933 at the young age of forty-eight. If you are looking for a book that will provide you with information on his life in addition to examples of his writing on numerous subjects this is a book I think you will enjoy. I found it to be an okay read, but not as good as I had hoped it to be."},{"Title":"Ring: A Biography of Ring Lardner","review":"The Roaring 20's in retrospect are a time of such burning energy, and social breakthrough, that it dwarfs almost every other decade as a benchmark of human spark. In the art world, the artists created the Dada movement. Writers such as Lawrence, Fitzgerald and Hemingway dominated the literary scene. And the sports pages came alive with the writings of Hype Igoe, Grantland Rice, and perhaps the most popular of all, Ring Lardner.Ring Lardner was perhaps the first superstar sportswriter. He wrote with a breezy, original style, which often included poetry. The figures of the time were so vivid, that the writers became almost as popular as those they wrote about. His story is interesting, as he was unique, and yet in some ways a cliche of what sportswriters would be known for...a hard drinking man's man.Lardner came to exemplify his times for his style and his wit, and yardley blends in many excerpts of his daily writing, Yet Lardner's style does not always move with the times. One can see how trailblazing it was, and admire it, but it does not translate to our times.My main criticism of this book is that it paints such a vivid picture of the times in the first chapter, with a story about Ty Cobb as a rookie calling out a veteran Honus Wagner, and gitting the worsr of that encounter. The book never delivers on that early promise as a portal to the times of Ring Lardner.Still, Lardner is a worthy subject, and this book, a primer to his value in the culture of the times."},{"Title":"Ring: A Biography of Ring Lardner","review":"I was delighted to finally find a biography of Ring Lardner. I had read all his stories, and the &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; articles. I was full of anticipation when I began reading Mr. Yardleys history of early baseball under the guise of a Biography of Ring Lardner. I realize that Ring Lardner wrote about baseball, but Mr. Yardley's coverage of this part of Ring Lardner's life is over done to put it mildly.When I read a biography I expect to learn about the details of the individual's life, not baseball stories during the teens.Mr. Yardley does cover some very limited events of Ring Lardner's life between his baseball history lessons. If I want to read a book on Baseball history, I would find a book on that subject. While some may find the stories entertaining, I found them boring and over done.If you are looking for a Biography of Ring Lardner's life do not buy this book. If you want a early history of Baseball you will be right at home. I rate this book in reality 5 yawns, the only way I could stay awake reading it was on a cross trainer at the gym and even then it was an effort."},{"Title":"the Anderson Tapes","review":"I found this book in a second-hand shop and, having seen the Sean Connery film, thought it would be worth a read. The plot itself is relatively simple (a bunch of mafia-funded crooks heist a well-to-do apartment building), but the main raison d'etre is that all the plot and dialogue is relayed via a series of witness statements or wiretaps. Whilst it is very unlikely that all the wiretaps detailed in the book would all have been put in place by different federal units, it is even more unlikely that all the key events in the build up to the heist would have been held in the prescence of these wire taps. Still, as a dramatic device, the novelty value of this approach makes the book interesting. However, by writing the book in this relatively fragmented fashion, the pace of the book does lag in the buildup to the heist; also, I found it hard to get into the minds of any of the characters as most of the plot concerns what people say or do rather than what they think. This approach was supposedly groundbreaking at the time the book was written (late 60's), but the book is pretty run-of-the-mill now."},{"Title":"the Anderson Tapes","review":"THE ANDERSON TAPES is one of the most unusually constructed novels I have ever read. It is the story of a robbery - its planning, execution and aftermath - but it is notable for being written almost entirely in the form of transcribed wiretaps, which have been assembled by the author in such a way as to tell a coherent and often gripping crime story.The novel is set in New York City in 1968. Professional burglar John \\"Duke\\" Anderson, fresh out of prison, is already planning his next caper, the \\"one big score\\" which will allow him to retire. Seems that Duke has his eye on cleaning out a luxury apartment building from basement to rooftop - robbing the rich tenants of their jewels, artworks, and ready cash. To pull off this score, he needs a whole crew of men - scouts, con-men, alarm experts, muscle, getaway drivers.He also needs the permission, and the help, of the local mob - and not only do they want a piece of the action, they also have a \\"special request\\" which Anderson has no choice but to grant.As the day of the big heist approaches, Duke attempts to plan for every contingency, every possible thing that could go wrong, until the entire operation is hatchway tight and completely foolproof. The question he fails to ask is: Is it genius-proof, too?Although I'm a huge Lawrence Sanders fan, THE ANDERSON TAPES is not a book I expected to like. The device of telling a whole story by wiretap and through \\"official reports\\" is a bit daunting, but once you warm to it it's actually pretty damn compelling as well. It's true that Sanders' understanding of the Mafia is tainted by a lack of knowledge; however, that's not his fault; when this book was written the mob's secrets were still largely secret. And while Sanders is arguably the best prose-writer of his era, his dialogue was never realistic - like Mario Puzo, he could never resist putting outsize words in the mouths of his characters, so that his Mafia Dons sound more like Oxford Dons, and subeducated hustlers use five-syllable words. However, in the end, the book does exactly what it sets out to do - it entertains, grips, and makes you turn pages faster and faster as you follow Duke Anderson through the intricacies of his One Big Score. For the record, it also paints a fascinating picture of crime in the pre cell-phone era. It is also notable for introducing toward the end of the book the character of Edward X. Delaney, an NYPD precinct commander who was later to become the central character of Sanders' DEADLY SIN mystery series.In short, if you like crime stories, I can't imagine you won't enjoy THE ANDERSON TAPES."},{"Title":"the Anderson Tapes","review":"Somewhat surprised by the other reviews which only gave it a mild thumbs up. I thought the book was extraordinary and thrilling. It was a breakthrough book at the time and, I believe, was the stepping stone for Lawrence Sanders to quit journalism and become a full time crime writer. It has a wonderful flavor of the late 60's early 70's New York and has that feeling of a fictionalized true story in the style of In Cold Blood by Capote. I think there is a movie with the same name, but as I recall it has nothing to do with this book. I recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"the Anderson Tapes","review":"Will this ingenious scheme to burglarize an entire apartment building succeed?

The skincare chapters are the weakest sections; most people have skintypes that don't fall neatly into one of the few categories listed in the book, and the information on skincare products just skims the surface.The chapters on hair are good at covering the basics, and the tips on coloring/processing will be useful for anyone wanting to do at-home coloring. The step-by-step hairstyling instructions mostly apply only to those with longer hair. One helpful aspect of this book, used in every section, is the suggestions given for different age groups, from teens to women in their fifties and beyond.The cosmetics section is by far the most in-depth, with plenty of information on product types and application tips for just about every situation. The color section on how to get different 'looks' is interesting, but it would be easier for women to duplicate the looks if the makeup used was a more readily available, more inexpensive brand than Nars. The chapter on brows is excellent. The only thing lacking is the absence of any solid advice on choosing the correct colors for your skintone.This book would be great for women of any age, though it might be especially helpful for teens or anyone else just getting into beauty regimens.

Thank you, feminists. But I have always felt a bit of reticence about being identified with feminism, because I believe that who really suffers from gender role stereotyping today is men. Men can't cry, they can't giggle, they can't dress up silly, they can't admit they need someone to love them, they can't be afraid, they can't do a million things that bring joy or solace to women because someone will think they're gay, or they're weak, or dependent, or what the hell ever it is that we think a \\"real man\\" is not. From what I can see, men still live in serious fear of so many irrational things that are perceived to threaten masculinity, and these fears are so deep seated that we don't even consider them when we talk about gender roles. The unspoken thesis of this book is that what really makes men weak and broken is, in fact, the assumption that masculinity has to be forged in a fire of rejection and isolation by the parents who love them and are charged with their care during childhood. It's an eloquent and heartfelt plea to see this sad arrangement for what it is, and change it. It's a revolutionary idea, and it's just so rarely said. Please read this book. It's important."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Just want to recommend this book to other mothers of sons. It's a very unique book in that it's not about the details of raising boys, rather it's about how our culture and learned behaviors lead us, as moms, to distance ourselves from our sons. When we come to understand this unconscious behavior we can counteract it and have the lasting connection we want."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"The author is indifferent regarding the development of masculine characteristics. The positive reviews seem to be from readers who sought the book because it reinforces their own predisposition to raising children androgenously. That does not make this a good book."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"When I found out I was having a boy, I was distressed, given that I come from a family of all girls and had no experience with boys. I also don't find most men very appealing on a human level. I doubted my ability to have and maintain a close relationship with a boy-man and this was a matter of some sadness to me.This book exposed my expectations for what they were - socially induced, i.e. mothers shouldn't be too close to their male children, or they will emasculate them, etc. It is a brilliant book with many compelling examples and its arguments are wholly consistent with common sense and instinct. My husband read some of it and thought its hypothesis was obvious, but it is strikingly different in its prescriptions than any other book on raising boys that I have read. (For instance, the &quot;Wonder of Boys,&quot; which says mothers have to leave their sons alone, let them be driven by testosterone into competitiveness, roughness, and machoism, and basically seems to take the attitude that mothers are responsible for most problems their boys have growing up.This is a positive, hopeful book, displaying warmth and compassion, and seems much more pyschologically sound. It should be required reading of all mothers, along with &quot;Real Boys&quot; of Pollock, which is its more recent successor."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"I came to the dialog of gender issues from a feminist perspective. I believed, after becoming the mother of two boys, that I pretty much understood gender issues as they related to boys...that is until my two and half year old wanted to buy purple boots. All of a sudden I found myself concerned (afraid!) of what other mothers and his peers would say (or think) about those purple boots. Without shaming him outloud, I subtly directed him toward the dark blue pair. I was totally amazed at my own fear of bending gender rules for a boy! I would have bought combat boots or any other kind of \\"boy\\" attire for a daughter but I could not bring myself to allow him to wear something others might find too \\"feminine\\". That was three years ago. After having read this book, I am now noticing all the other ways I have subtly or not-so-subtly directed him along a culturally acceptable gender path. And I consider myself to be a feminist. This book was my first exposure to the idea that I won't harm my boys by allowing them the freedom to express themselves, however that might look. This book was my first exposure to the idea that mothers don't harm their sons by loving them passionately and joyfully. I am so grateful for having read this book and I am going to buy it for at least 3 other mothers I know who are raising boys. This should be required reading for ALL parents of boys!!!"},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"When I was pregnant with my second child, my first boy, I worried a lot about raising him successfully when I had almost no family experience with boys (coming from a family with no brothers, and an often absent father). I knew I wanted to help him avoid all the pitfalls of modern manhood (made vivid by a reading of the book, &quot;The McGill Report on Male Intimacy&quot;). All of the books I had read seemed to come from an &quot;Iron John&quot; perspective or be a sort of vague, New Agey feel-good book, but none of them offered concrete steps and clear facts until I read &quot;The Courage To Raise Good Men.&quot; Here at last was a book that told me what my heart should have known all along: just love him like he's a child becoming an adult, and don't try to push him at all (he'll grow up even if you don't push!). This book is not written from a feminist perspective but it would suit any feminist's needs in trying to figure out how to raise a boy into a well-balanced human who happens to be male."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"I found this book in a baby goods resale shop in Chicago, where our oldest daughter works. We were shopping for a gift for our first grand child. Our youngest son and his precious wife are expecting in a few days. The title intrigued me and after I scanned it I knew I had to get it and see to it that all my 4 read it. I decided when I was having my sons that they were going to grow up knowing how to be husbands and fathers. I had grown up watching my father and brothers beat their chests and try to impress us with their &quot;macho-ness&quot; I wasn't impressed and determined I was going to find a man who was not afraid of his feelings. I managed to find one who was open enough to learn and have been married to him for nearly 40 yuears, and...we still like each other We have managed to raise two young men who are loving , caring, and whom I have an open and loving relationship with. They all still call from their various locations at least once a week and we gave them all video phones so we can all see each other. The neatest part is they are FRIENDS and they all like each other and communicate often. It can be done!! Thank you for bringing the subject to the attention of the multitude of young people who don't have a clue about raising a whole person. Our youngest said he realized a while ago that they are expecting a person, not just a baby. I feel so grateful to have understood my obligation as a woman and mother. This book should be required reading in any parenting class that is taught. Than you for writing the book and Blessings to you and your sweet son. The relationship between a mother and son can be as deliciously rewarding as it is with a daughter. I am purchasing a copy of it for all 4 of our progeny. They will perpetuate the &quot;whole&quot; man and woman."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Silverstein's work brilliantly and clearly describes how boy babies and children are pushed away from their mother's nurturing in order to make &quot;real men&quot; of them and out of fear that they will turn into &quot;sissy boys&quot;. She shows how boys, then, are abandoned and isolated emotionally, and are left to grow up alone without relational and emotional support. This creates adult men who cannot connect emotionally, and who are reinforced by the culture to be distant. For every mother who has wanted to raise a son to be an emotionally available adult partner, and who is not afraid of raising that wonderful person called a &quot;mama's boy&quot;, this book is a must read. I found it shortly after my son's birth and it did more to support my natural instincts that almost any other source."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"I was nervous about having a boy, having been raised in an all female family, but knowing a lot about boys from the boyfriend-girlfriend point of view. How could I raise my son so that he would grow up in touch with his own feelings but unafraid to be a man? This book offers a clear and convincing argument for change, and a pretty straightforward solution to the problem."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"I have read many books in this field, and this is by far one of the best. It is about how in order to raise 'strong' and 'successful' men, we often do very damaging things to our little boys. The good news is that this is relatively easy to fix - just keep on loving them, with the open affection that we gave them when they were babies. The authors believe that mothers too are withdrawing from their sons, in the belief that too much contact makes them too feminine, but they strongly disagree with that, and think maternal contact makes them human and humane."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Silverstein presents facts and figures illustrating the damage done to, not only males but humanity in general, by the tendancy in our society and others to push boys toward activities designed to foster a sense of &quot;male-ness&quot; in them.She recommends, instead, allowing males and females to find their own gender path. This, she contends, can have a humanizing effect on our society. She also gives case examples where reuniting men with their mothers, in other words, giving them permission to love and accept love from each other, freely, has had a curative effect, not only on those involved, but on the family as a whole.I was so impressed with Silverstein's theories, I plan to design a college study around her work. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gender issues. It also serves as a strong counterpoint to the so called &quot;men's movement."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"My two children are boys, but they are 24 and 26! So why did I buy this book, you ask? A friend and I were recently discussing how our culture has different expectations for men in terms of showing emotions. She mentioned this book ... so I bought it. I also feel that I am still in the process of parenting my sons, so I figured more information would not be a bad thing.This book has a lot of examples that show how subtly we treat boys differently from girls that give them (the boys) the message they have to be STRONG. The author also talks about how our culture empasizes the need for a \\"strong, male authority figure\\" in a young boy's life. This is fine until the culture also diminishes the value and importance of a strong mother.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the examples the author uses are somewhat dated -- Karate Kid for instance -- that current young mothers may not relate to."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Wow! This is one excellent book! Olga was right on the money when she said that it is NOT necessary for boys to &quot;detach&quot; emotionally from their mothers in order to grow up (&amp; become &quot;real men&quot;). The book could have also been written by Mary Perry, Steve Perry's mom. (Steve Perry had a WONDERFUL relationship with his mom &amp; often turned to her for advice). Olga explodes many of the untrue myths surrounding sons, including the rules of conventional &quot;masculinity&quot;. She exposes the &quot;men's movement&quot; &amp; the &quot;fatherhood&quot; pundits for what they are...conservatives attempting to push their agenda on families...conservatives who tell mothers that they are inadequate for their sons &amp; need men around to raise their sons for them, that a close relationship with mom is bad or &quot;emasculating,&quot; etc. I like how she encourages moms to rise to the task of raising their sons, especially single mothers, who just as good as dads.(Contrary to popular belief, sons of single moms are BETTER off than other men &amp; enjoy a closer relationship with their mothers in adulthood). Largely, her book proves that the old rigid gender patterns are limiting &amp; destructive to both sexes &amp; that feminism is not only pro-female, but pro-male as well."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Network Administration Study Guide (Exam 70-216) (Book/CD-ROM)","review":"Lots of words, but little useful information.

The author is very good at explaining most of the topics. The print is nice and big so you won't go blind reading it. For those who wish to pass the exam, this book will help.However, the book does little more than give someone a very basic understanding of the major topics for the exam. Perhaps the biggest fault with this book is that it is very disorganized. Many topics which are related are spread out over several chapters which makes learning the material very confusing. Some of the major topics like RRAS (Routing and Remote Access Server) are very poorly written as well. Do you hate it when you read a book and the author makes reference to a later chapter without fully explaining the point that he/she is trying to teach? There are many such instances of this throughout the entire book.The diagrams do very little to help show the reader what the author is trying to teach. Unfortunately, the CD is just as bad. The exam questions are good practice though and I like the fact that they are not similar to the real exam. However, many people will not like this fact since the exam is the main reason they would consider purchasing the book. If you're serious about buying a book that will help you learn and pass the 70-216 exam than look elsewhere. If you are a professional with experience who wishes to prepare for the exam, you will find this book lacks detail. If you don't care about long term learning and just wish to pass the exam this book may help you."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Network Administration Study Guide (Exam 70-216) (Book/CD-ROM)","review":"This book does a very good job covering DNS, DHCP, WINS, and RRAS.

Exam simulator is a simple web based tool without advanced options like re-taking questions you are bad at or similar.

The core topics are covered very well - dns, wins, dhcp, ip addressing, nat/ics, vpn, ipsec, and rras. Certificate Services could have been more thorough and a more in depth explanation on cidr. The exam tips and two minute drills were very helpul in hammering home the important points and great for final study review. The overall layout of the book was excellent. The end of chapter questions for the most part were nothing like the real exam, so do not count on them to gauge your rediness for the real exam, but to be fair I have not found any book that has realistic exam type questions - the Sybex 70-216 2nd edition is close though. This Syngress book along with LOTS of hands on practice on a home network lab will help prepare you well for the exam. You will NOT be able to pass this exam by ANY book alone. I also recommend extensive use of the onboard help that comes with Windows 2000 - it is a wonderful resource. Also searching the Microsoft website for related articles (dns, dhcp, wins, rras, etc) for further study will serve you well.

If he had stayed in Holland and become a professor in Delft, graduating in aerospace engineering would have been much easier for me. This guy loves aircraft more than mathematics ! The best place to read this book is during a long trip on a 747"},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"This a fascinating look at how things fly. Insects, birds and airplanes all obey the same aerodynamic principles. With a few simple equations and copious examples the author explains lift, drag, wing loading, cruising speed and other aerodynamic concepts.His descriptions of how birds fly, how much energy their flight requires and how they meet the challenge is as exciting as any adventure story. We learn that the pectoral muscles of birds can metabolize fats directly(Human muscles burn sugars which the liver must first convert from fat). But flying is hard work. After 12 hours of cruising a migrating swan will clock 650 miles and lose more than a kilogram of body weight. Thus the importance of bird sanctuaries. Migrating birds must feed to continue their journies.Moving on to airplanes we learn that the Concorde uses 70 tons of kerosene to cross the ocean carrying 100 passengers. The 747 uses the same amount of fuel but carries 350 people and 30 tons of freight. This book explains why.This book is filled with fascinating facts about flight, but charts, tables and illustrations tie them all together. There are a few equations but they are there to enlighten. The author doesn't overwhelm you with mathematics. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"This delightful little book is an introduction to some major aspects of flight. Not all of them. There isn't much on strength of materials, for example. This book concentrates on the fundamental issues of how much power it takes to fly and what size a flying machine ought to be to make optimal use of its power. What makes the book so much fun is the inclusion of flight characteristics of birds and insects.Tennekes starts with a chart of weight versus cruising speed for the insects, birds, and planes. Next, he discusses wing sizes. Then fuel consumption, strategies for takeoffs and landings, and gliding.The author concludes with some praise for the design of the Boeing 747. All commercial passenger planes are best off flying as fast as possible without getting too near the speed of sound, so Mach 0.9 is best. These planes are best off flying high enough to take advantage of the cooler air and good weather: a height of 10 kilometers is ideal. To match the cruising speed with the optimal wing loading at that height, one gets an airplane which is roughly the size and shape of a Boeing 747.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"Since years I love the aviation, only for curiosity I bought this book, and in one morning I've enjoyed too much and learnt a lot about aerodynamics, fuel consumption, the migration of birds(really interesting), the forces in skating! etc. It is a book with of 120 pages really educative and comprenhensible, all questions I made in my mind reading the book were answered a few pages ahead.

In addition to being a fine introduction to how things fly, the book is a quick and easy read at only 130-odd pages.The book's final chapter, devoted to the Boeing 747 and its competitors, makes a compelling argument that the 747 is the most most efficient and well engineered plane in history."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"This book is definately the most outstanding source for basic aeronautical science. The author's unique perspective, looking at a 747 as compared to a budgy, is a tremendous help in explaining various concepts, from finesse to fuel economy. Although it is not an intense calculus based textbook, it does a great job of making you understand how and why things occur.Mr. Tennekes analogies between birds and aircraft will make you realize the commanality of the two previously distinct subjects. I strongly believe that no one, or at least not many, ar above this book. With everything from sailplanes to skating, supersonic flight to hovering explained, this book should appeal to anyone remotely interested in the subject."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"This little book (130 pages) using just 3 or 4 very simple algebraic equations tells the story behind the fundmental designs of insects, birds, kites, ..., jumbo jets. So why should anyone cares? Because flight is mysterious, fascinating, and obviously complicated - for birds as well as for the jets. Yet, all the flights are related and dictated by a few very simple formulas. In less than 4 pages, this book will tell you why Boeing 747 is the most successful aircraft ever produced, why it MUST weight about 350 tons, why it MUST cruise at 560 mph at 40,000 feet, why the size of the 747 is out of the control of the Boeing engineers (even though they might not think so). Why a 350-ton 747 can make tons of money for its owner, but not a future 1,000-ton ultra-jumbo. It is incredible that how some simple math can tell us so much about such an esoteric and complicated subject. If your kids (or little brothers/sisters) ever ask you about why bother learning math, tell them the stories from this book. We need more teachers like Professor Tennekes to make us enjoy and appreciate all that math we struggled with in high school - which many many people will probably never find any use in real life!There is just one thing I found a little puzzling about this book. Professor Tennekes does not once mention the Bernoulli's effect. His simple but powerful equations have airspeed as the key paramter in all winged flights, but not the relative difference of air speed above the wing and below the wing, which according to Bernoulli, as taught in our high school physics, is what generates the lifting force. Could there be more than just the Bernoulli's effect invovled here?"},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"This is the book that a lot of aviation enthusiasts have been looking for- one that explains in detail, using only basic math, the parameters that control flight. Most aerodynamics books are written either for the rank beginner, and give only a simple and intuitive explanation- using a demonstration of the Bernoulli effect involving blowing over a sheet of paper- or they're for the engineer, and involved pages of dense, incomprehensible differential equations that leave the average reader going lost.Underlying all forms of flight, whether you're talking about gnats or 747s, are a very few simple algebraic equations that describe the tradeoffs between mass, area, drag, speed, lift, aspect ratio and other variables the reader is probably already familiar with. Using these equations, the author can explain why a 747 has to fly within a certain range of speeds at a given altitude, why a hummingbird has to eat so much, and how sea birds can cruise ofor hours while exerting very little energy. This book belongs on the shelf of every aviation enthusiast, and, I would venture to say, every birder and ornithologist as well."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"So whether we're talking about a bumblebee or a Boeing 747, the same physics are at work? This book does a great job of explaining how the same basic principles apply to all flight, and the physiological differences that allow both a jetliner and a monarch butterfly to sustain flight. The physics are well-outlined, and are simple enough for anyone with some HS algebra to grasp. Still, in between the formulas, the writing is lively and entertaining, and entertaining to anyone with an interest in aerodynamics."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"I own about a dozen books about aircraft design, flight, aerodynamics and more.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Simple Science of Flight","review":"This brief, handsome, book explains a few of the basic mathematical principles governing speed and efficiency of flight. You don't need anything more advanced than high school algebra to comprehend the material but you, like me, may have to work a little bit if you haven't used math in a while. The author focuses on birds and jets but mentions insects, human powered aircraft, gliders, kites, and even pteranodon's. I found the treatment of the force triangle obscure (the skating analogy didn't help). I also wish the author had developed more topics (for example, I was left wondering why an angle of attack of 6 degrees is common)."},{"Title":"On City Streets An anthology of Poetry","review":"This is a fantastic selection of poems which is wonderful to read and re-read, which I have been doing since the early 1970's, first as a high school student and every year until now, passing it on to my child who also became enamored. I wish they would reprint it for a new generation and that more teachers knew of it. For all ages, the poems capture the youthful spirit, freshness, fragility and reality of life in the city, both its ups and downs without feeling dated or overly sentimental. From the iron horses Robert Frost, TS Eliot and Langston Hughes to William Carlos Williams and Gwendoyln Brooks, this has something for everyone to think about, highly recommended!Here are some short examples, the first, \\"Husbands and Wives\\", by Miriam Hershenson:Husbands and wiveswith children between themsit in the subway;so I have seen them.One word onlyfrom station to stationSo much talk forso close a relation.Another by Sanderson Vanderbilt:\\"December\\"A little boy stood on the cornerAnd shoveled bits of dirty soggy snowinto the sewer-With a jagged piece of tin.He was helping spring come.One more, by Rachel Field, \\"Manhattan Lullaby\\":Now lighted windows climb the dark,The streets are dim with snow,Like tireless beetles, amber-eyed,The creeping taxis go.Cars roar through the caverns made of steel,Shrill sounds the siren horn,And people dance and die and wed-And boys like you are born.Okay, I can't resist one more by William Carlos Williams;\\"Proletarian Portrait\\"A big young bareheaded womanin an apronHer hair slicked back standingon the streetOne stockinged foot toeingthe sidewalkHer shoe in her hand.

Each photo is a glipse into a disposible, plastic life. Does the piggy want to play or cause terror? Is the lamb timid, sad or sleepy?

Derek Stone will break into a secure apartment, discover the safe's combination, remove the blackmail material, and vanish. His government will be happy and he'll move on to the next project--because there's always a next project. Another job to keep his mind off of the emptiness that is his life. Of course, that's the way he wants it.Derek has the routine down for his job and doesn't expect to be interupted, but he's cany enough to notice the slight movement in the closet. But the last person he expects to find there is Alyssa Ballard--the women he'd spent a wonderful week with six month's earlier.He'd been irresistable, her dream man. For an entire week, they'd made love, talked, visited the sights. And then he'd vanished, a brief note his only good-bye. Six months later, Alyssa has recovered, mostly. She's moved to Dallas, done well in her job, and even dates--a little. Except no man can compare to the week she spent with Derek. The only problem is, everything Derek told her was a lie, even his name. When he breaks into the complex she manages, Alyssa suspects Derek lied because he's a thief, but she overhears enough to learn better--or worse. Derek is a spy, fighting for his country for the money.Author Jane Sullivan (Jane Graves) writes a great tortured hero. Derek has denied his dreams and looked at family from the outside. He's certain that whatever might be there, it isn't for him. A subplot involving a wedding where Derek is supposed to be the best man--but keeps dragging the groom away for one last emergency job--adds humor and lets Derek see the side of relationships and love that he's always denied.Sullivan mixes a good dose of steamy sensuality into the recipe. All in all, it's powerful stuff. Derek is a great character, the action sequences propel the story forward, Alyssa comes off as spunky and a good match for Derek. Bottom line, ONE NIGHT IN TEXAS is a winner.Jane Sullivan/Jane Graves is a double-RITA finalist for the two Harlequin Temptations she published in 2004. I wouldn't be surprised to see ONE NIGHT IN TEXAS being nominated next year."},{"Title":"One Night In Texas (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"One Night In Texas by Jane SullivanHarlequin Temptation # 1022 - May 200524 Hours: The Wedding theme2006 RITA Nominee for Best Short ContemporarySix months ago in Seattle, Alyssa had the fling of a life time and still she tingles when she remembers Derek. When Derek left suddenly, she was disappointed and then hurt when she found out he'd lied about his name. Now transferred to the Dallas hotel of the chain she works for, she goes to the penthouse to fix a little problem the maid left behind. Hearing someone coming, she glances and is shocked to find a man in a ski mask, so she hides in the closet. The burglar removes items from the safe and then talks to someone over a microphone. Alyssa's in shock, that voice, that scar on his forearm, that ring ... that's Derek. Suddenly Derek has to explain that he's a government operative retrieving blackmail evidence on several congressmen; evidence strong enough to sway their votes on delicate legislation soon to be presented for vote. The next 24 hours are hectic with Alyssa and Derek rarely apart. Alyssa finds herself helping Derek in his undercover work. Their attraction is just as explosive now as it was six months before. Only now Alyssa sees the man Derek's been hiding, the one that's never ever had anyone tell him that he was loved. This explains his need for a job that takes him away for months at a time and into dangerous situations.I really liked this one. The 24 hour theme is a tremendous challenge, and Ms. Sullivan pulls it off wonderfully. The story is packed with intrigue, heat and with some very touching moments. Derek's never known love, not as a child or as a man. So when Alyssa introduces him to love and life as she sees it, he's scared. Great story!There's alot in this story that makes it stand out. The plot is exciting; that race to get the blackmailer and the secondary race to not miss Derek's friend's wedding really work well. Ms. Sullivan uses Alyssa's very intense daydream of meeting Derek to establish their passionate connection. The whirlwind events when they meet again keeps the intensity of Alyssa's day dream going. Ms. Sullivan does an excellent job of allowing us inside these two. I can certainly see why this book is a RITA Nominee."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"I gave 4 stars to this book because the theme is very interesting; Baxter worked on an Earth threatened by an exponencial colonization wave coming from the deep space (directed by an allien especies called \\"crackers\\"). The concept is very original and is based in the fact that if the live flourish in almost every star system, in the most incredibles ways, is possible that the rate of growth of the population forces to colonize several stellar systems to survive, and in this process some worlds,inhabited or no, can be destroyed or exploited.In this book Baxter speculates on the possibility of several processes of colonization like this one, happened through aeons and our system including our own planet has been affected previously.All this is exciting, but the long periods of time included into the book make a little difficult to tie all the facts exposed. We can find some weakeness in some arguments like:- If our evolution process was \\"restarted\\" in some time, securely our start point was very different and possibly our ancestors could had very different physical characteristics (Depending on the moment at which the Earth was affected). Into the book we find things like pre-historic animals, dinosaurs and Neardenthals returned to the life by the Gaijims to prevent the mankind extintion and start again. This sounds like a Gaijims eternal manipulationd that it is not sufficiently clarified.- Nemoto is alive after centuries with medical manipulation, and is as if she had a secret for this known by nobody - not mentioned.- The mankind lost all inventive, curiosity, technological advance, religions, with the incomming alliens (sound incredible to me)...Despite the previous details, i did enjoy the book, and found positive technical aspects like the accretion disc in a binary star system with a black hole, speculations about how would be the vision of the stars from a distant star system; so, I believe that something good can be found in the new book: Manifold- Origin."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"I think I would really enjoy a physics class taught by Mr Baxter, since the man clearly knows his science, knows which sources to go to and is able to synthesize them in ways that he can explain them without your head exploding. Also, he's able to extrapolate those ideas into some interesting scenarios that suggest some fun possibilities and open the mind up for more speculation. Alas, he's not able to translate that yet into novels with real emotional heft and the bigger his ideas get, the more the story tends to leave you behind. This book is the follow-up to Manifold: Time and as the title implies, while this book still requires great leaps in time, this time out we're more about moving outward than jumping forward. Jumping off the conclusions set by the last novel, Baxter essentially hits the reboot button and drops us in a totally different universe, although some of the characters are still the same. The most notable is our hero Reid Malenfant, who is older than the first book but just as obsessed with mankind securing their destiny beyond the stars. Instead of wondering how we're going to survive, however, he's more interested in why they aren't any other intelligent races in the galaxy, or at least why it seems that way. Meanwhile, an intelligent race does apparently decide to move into the solar system from far away and that's where the fun starts. Always willing to boldly go (split infinitive and everything), Reid disappears into a portal that was left by some prior alien race and the voyage of discovery begins. As I mentioned before, Baxter is fiend when it comes to idea and everything is well thought out. From the weird robot-like Gajin that show up, to all the other aliens that pop in every so often, to the effects of time and history when extrapolated thousands upon thousands of years into the future, it's like he's taking you through an exhibit hall in his mind, showcasing all the fun science-based ideas he has and dressing them up as science-fiction. However, it doesn't take long before the reader quickly starts to lose the plot and everything begins to drown in a sea of glorious information. There are gates that allow people to travel but since it's lights-speed, time dilation still applies and when they come back to Earth, it's hundreds of years in the future each time, leading to effects that aren't much different from what the soldier suffered in Joe Haldemann's famous The Forever War, namely culture shock and the sense of dissociation and alienation. Things progress and Baxter shows us people on the moon, people on different planets, different aliens in other star systems, the galaxy, the picture keeps blowing up bigger and bigger until you almost can't contain it. But we don't really ever find out what it all means. The cover copy on the back of the book suggests that the main thrust of the plot has something to do with the reasons why intelligent life flares up and then dies out, leaving artifacts scattered all around the galaxy that other races pick up on, and Baxter sprinkles plenty of hints that the solar system was previously used by other races for various purposes, but it's buried under such a sea of static that it's hard to sort through it all. Especially since Baxter seems to be acting like an excited child, throwing each new idea in our face almost as he comes up with it, \\"You like this? Well how about this? Or this? Or even this?\\" until you're almost numb from it. By the time he gets around to answering the central question, almost five hundred pages later, you're been dazzled by as many marvels as science can handle but feeling strangely empty at the same time. It almost feels like \\"Who cares?\\" and regardless of anything else, I doubt that's the reaction he intended. Still, he gets an A for effort and the individual moments are extraordinary, showing that he's a mind possessed of a far vision and the fact that he's able to take all this knowledge and assemble it into something resembling a story is amazing in itself. But when you add it all up, it's not quite everything it's supposed to be. Hard science junkies will probably eat it up like the candy it is, everyone else looking for slightly more emotional content may find it rough going at times but for anyone who wants to see if all those complicated ideas that involve words with too many letters actually might mean something, well this is as good a place to start as any."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"This is an odd story. It develops into a quest for the meaning of life. I enjoyed it's start: China and Japan have taken the lead in space exploration because the United States has not shown the desire to put money into such ventures. Then there is the time traveling aspect: going through portals to other systems takes the time it takes for light to travel, so rather then instantenous appearance, it is five or six years to get there and the same amount to get back. Rather simple, but no one has mentioned it before.The ending is a treat, a bit unsatisfying because you want to see happiness and success, and it is there in a sense, it is not what you expect."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Manifold: Space is a very frustrating novel. As with its predecessor, Manifold: Time, it is brimming with great hard science surrounding a very good premise. In the Manifold series, Baxter gives detailed and extended perspectives to \\"Fermi's paradox\\". Fermi articulated that, due to the huge extent and age of the universe, either life on Earth is completely unique and we are alone in the universe (the basis of in Manifold: Time), or life must be everywhere and we simply have yet to discover it (as espoused in this novel). The paradox with the 2nd view is that if life is everywhere, the age of the universe implies that we cannot be the first cognitive, noise-making intelligence; why, then, haven't we found evidence of this other life? Baxter's answer to this paradox is quite interesting: he ties up the multiple story threads of Manifold: Space with a good ending.Unfortunately, problems Baxter had with characterizations in Manifold: Time come to full flower in Manifold: Space. This novel is too seriously flawed too make it an overall enjoyable read.There is a lack of any kind of human \\"community\\" in Manifold: Space. The various astronauts/space discoverers that are central to the story are all unhappy loners. They go into space alone, seemingly unaided, and appear to have no friends or colleagues. The first astronaut to set foot on Venus, as one example, never communicates with anyone beyond a single individual on earth, and that individual is also a loner. Baxter often beautifully elucidates the technical side of space exploration, but appears to have no clue as to the human elements. Manifold: Space is a cold unhappy story: interesting science populated by lonely, depressed individuals."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Manifold: Space is the second of three books dealing with some of the big questions about the universe. The first book Manifold:Time assumed that humans were the only intelligences in the cosmos, and looked at what might happen over the next 1,000,000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000, 000,000 000,000 years (and every zero counts!). It was awe-inspiring but with a few flaws.This second book assumes that we aren't the only intelligence and it attempts to answer the question called Fermi's Paradox - if aliens exist, why aren't they here already ? After all, space is vast and the universe has already existed for thousands of millions of years. If they exist, what is holding them back?The plot is long and stretches over millenia. The central character is an American called Reid Malenfant, who is involved in making First Contact with an alien species , the Gaijin. As he then travels from star to star he leapfrogs the centuries as Earth's society collapses. Conservative and constrained settlements on the asteroids, Triton and a hauntingly sad Moon mean that humanity still survive, but in the Gaijin's shadow.As another set of aliens force the remnants of the human race into a final showdown, Malenfant gradually understands the nature of the cosmos and the motivation of the Gaijin. Life exists on almost any planet, but the physics of the universe means that death and extinction almost inevitably follow.With such an cosmic setting , it's difficult to produce an adequate climax, but Baxter does not disappoint here. Despite what other reviewers have said, I think the book is well-written and I have read it twice. It's one of the best examples of Britcosmic - and I recommend it if you like serious SF."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"This has to be the most epic story out there, Stephen Baxter laces hisexcellent story with real science and tons of interesting and ralistic theories!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Fascinating, unputdownable space opera yarn. Certainly has its weaknesses, characterisation is maybe not so strong, and the much vaunted &quot;hard science&quot; still relies on &quot;deus ex machina&quot; plot devices such as stargates (!) and miracle anti-ageing treatments not seen since the old testament. However, the &quot;idea density&quot; is so high that you would expect some duffers. Also, since I stayed up til 340am to finish it, I have to give it 5 stars! Author's misanthropic, Malthusian outlook does become a bit tedious at times but overall great speculative fiction.Incidentally, I have not read part 1 (Manifold: Time) and as far as I can see Manifold: Space is self-contained, however other readers who have read both may like to comment on this."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"I disagree with reviewers who say that Manifold: Space is too complex -- the universe is complex! -- but strongly agree that the characters are flat, the plot has gaping holes (was this originally a collection of short stories?), and by the end you're left wondering what's the point of it all. In addition, while I wouldn't deny that humanity *could* slip back into a dark ages, or become insular in the face of alien races, Baxter's portrayal of 21st century humans as 100% uninterested in the Gaijin goes too far to be believed.Then there's the ending... I won't give anything away, but let's just say it's feel-good Hollywood at its fuzziest."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Stephen Baxter brings surprising, depressing, and frightening ideas about how we got here, why we don't think we've found anyone else in the universe, and what's in store for us when we do. Or it's a political and environmental commentary about what bad things countries are doing to each other while we're all doing it to the only planet we've got. How science will not save us, and in fact that there's no saving us at all. Just one big universal slog, from (cosmic) dust to dust. Yes, main characters, heroes, and adventures do keep you turning the pages to the next event. But there's no real story here, and the points have been made long before their repetition extends Space as much too long a book. Meanwhile, it's fair that Baxter brings religion and G-d into the equation, because that's our answer to the big questions. But again, the point can be made in a much shorter treatise -- try Ecclesiastes."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"\\"Space\\" is the second book in Stephen Baxter's Manifold trilogy, and a sequel of sorts to \\"Time\\", although it can also be read independently. Once again the central character is Reid Malenfant, an ex-NASA astronaut and failed entrepreneur. Obsessed with the search for extraterrestrial life, Malenfant seeks a solution to the Fermi paradox: given that the universe is billions of years old, if life exists out in the cosmos, why don't we see the evidence of it all about us? Thus when alien intelligence is detected out in the asteroid belt, Malenfant takes it upon himself to investigate, to make contact and ultimately to follow them back to the stars, through the mysterious blue portals through which they came.The action unfolds over no less than 1,800 years, from the present day up to the thirty-eighth century, with the final, epic conclusion set another 5,000 years after that. In this way Baxter lays out a compelling vision of the possible long-term effects of Earth's contact with aliens. Unlike in \\"Time\\", where he employs an interesting mix of faux newspaper articles, blogs and journal entries to tell his story, in \\"Space\\" he sticks to a more conventional third-person narrative. The story is related through the perspective of four or five main characters, all of whom use the portals to travel to the stars and see life beyond Earth, and who, over the course of many years, become witnesses to the gradual decline of human civilisation.The story is episodic in nature, and has the impression of a number of short stories loosely linked together. This can be frustrating for the reader, as there are enough intriguing ideas packed in this book to sustain half a dozen different novels. Each successive world is imaginatively drawn - from Earth, Io, Triton and Mercury to Alpha Centauri and far beyond - but Baxter tends to pass over them all very quickly, which does become tiresome. There comes a point about two-thirds of the way in when one wonders what the ultimate point is. Another result of the disjointed nature of the novel is that is difficult to feel fully engaged with the characters or get a sense of their development in these extraordinary circumstances. It is disappointing, too, that Malenfant - in principle a fascinating character - does not feature more, despite his centrality to the story. However, it is clear that this is not meant to be a character-driven novel so much as one based around ideas. Indeed \\"Space\\" has at its heart themes of human ambition and determination, consciousness and identity, self and soul, and the will to survive in a hostile universe, all of which are explored in depth.In \\"Space\\", the author shows an imagination and consideration of the big questions of existence which is not often seen in most modern SF. It is true that there is less hard science and more scientifically-informed speculation than there was in \\"Time\\", but Baxter delivers it with such confidence that it hardly matters. This is truly a novel for the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"I don't understand the glowing reviews of other readers. bad characterizations, stupid names, no discernable plot and depressing. oh, and once in a while a clever idea. after 200 pages I couldn't take it any more and threw it out. read Benford or Brin or Vinge if you want to see what *good* sci-fi written by a physicist is like."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"awful, awful, awful. One of the three unfinished books in my reading career, and I am actually proud of that fact."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"This book was supposed to be the sequel to Manifold: Time. When I finished that book and learned of a sequel, I was elated, becasue it was a very cool story. The whole concept of needing a \\"Big Dumb Booster\\" in Manifold: Time grated on my own impression of the future. We're talking about a few decades from now, 2002, and already some aerospace engineers are working on stuff that makes Baxter's BDB seem like 70's technology. I just don't get it.One of the things that really got on my nerves was Baxter's constant derision for NASA and the space program. Along with his ridiculous story, VOYAGE, he continues to belittle NASA just because the US has not sent people to Mars yet. I honestly wonder if Baxter realizes that we don't yet have the technology to do it yet. Sending probes to all the planets, launching Hubble and the cosmic background radiation explorer were far more useful to science than a manned mission to Mars. So that constantly grates on my nerves throughout this book.But on to specifics. Manifold: Time ended with \\"superbeings\\" at the end of time deciding that the universe should not have ended as it had, and so they sent a message back in time, and it was detected by Cornelius Taine and Malenfant. They found the teleporter on that asteroid. He talked about cool micro-robots that could manufacture things, about intelligent squid (which is a crock, apparently showing that Baxter knows nothing about information systems, IT, or software, but still...). His ideas were engaging, and it was a fun book.Manifold: Space, which is the sequel, was supposed to continue where Time left off, right? Instead, it's some kind of weird parallel universe that I just didn't understand at all. What is the matter with Baxter? What was all that nonsense with the Neandertals and the resurrected animals on Earth? What was the point of the colonies on Triton and Mercury? These sub-plots went absolutely NO WHERE! Okay, so the Neandertals are doing work on Triton for the Gaijin. For what purpose? We never hear anything more about it. Manifold: Origin is supposed to be something about the origin of life in the universe. Baxter has this idea in his head that the subatomic structure of the universe \\"brings forth\\" life of its own accord, as if life is built into the fabric of space/time. What a crock! This sort of crack-pot nonsense really bothers me, coming from the author of the fabulous book, The Time Ships.If you are looking for a sequel to Time and want to learn more about what happened to Malenfant and Co, this book will most certainly not answer any questions or further develop those entertaining characters. It's downright frustrating and I wholly dislike this book. I am not going to read Manifold: Origin because I think Baxter is off his rocker. If I find out that Origin finally explains what happened with the superbeings at the end of time, and if they actually did redo the universe, then okay, maybe. But if it's just another collection of short stories like Space, forget it."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Manifold is a series of books with big, visionary concepts, and Space is no different. This time the twist on the Fermi paradox has the aliens existing and actually quite near the Earth. Reid Malenfant investigates with a mysterious Japanese scientist Nemoto. The first contact is made and the truth starts to unfurl...As I said, the ideas are big - seriously big. The flow of the story isn't always fast enough, it all gets a bit too slow at times. Still, one has to admire Baxter's vision and while parts of the book were slightly boring, the whole of the story was definitely captivating enough to get me through the slower bits.Manifold: Space offers an interesting what-if scenario of the future of humankind in a world that has extraterrestrial life."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"I have just finished Manifold: Space, which is not a sequel to Manifold Time but rather ruminations on an alternate future for mankind. This is the fourth Baxter book I have read, and like the previous three, I am dazzled by his imagination and scientific knowledge, but disappointed and baffled by his lack of writing skills. In short, his SF is strong on the science but really weak on the fiction.In Space, Baxter engages in a thought experiment that has plagued the minds of so many scientists and SF fans - given the vast age and size of the universe, where are the aliens? Baxter provides a very credible theory on why we haven't been visited by the little green men: life is everywhere, but it is nasty, brutish and short... if the internal strifes and self-induced ecological disasters don't get you, natural disasters will. In this book aliens, called the Gaijin, do make contact with humans. But it is at a point in history where humanity is in decline (this book is set in 2020 and beyond, and Baxter is very pessimistic about our ability to handle the forthcoming environmental/ecological problems). Hence, the next 1000 years is a very dark time for humanity, a handful of pathetic humans barely able to survive on the moons of Earth and Jupiter. The main characters of the book travel to and from the stars over the span of 1000 years and beyond, trying to understand why it is so difficult for intellient life to last and how they can reverse the imminent collapse of the human race. Baxter does a characteristically great job of analyzing with brutal logic what humans are forced to endure and how they must adapt to the harsh conditions. The ending is as sweeping and grand as any of the great Arthur C. Clarke books, but, without giving anything away, let's just say that there is very little room for sentimentality in Baxter's works.I would like to discuss Baxter's writing in general here. He possesses, without a doubt, a first rate imagination that is capable of producing some spectacular ideas about the future, both near (as in decades) and mind-numbingly far (billions of years). He also possesses that Clarkeian gift for beautiful, romantic endings that make you gasp and ponder our insignificance in the grand order of the cosmos. He is in fact better than Clarke and other hard SF writers when it comes to laying out in detail what the consequences to humanity are of alien contact or a technological breakthrough. A case in point is the awe-inspiring work, Light of Other Days, where he (with Clarke) thoroughly dissect the impact on culture and civilization brought about by the development of a 'video cam' that can see back in time.What is so exasperating about Baxter's works is his over-emphasis on such scientific detail. In Space, for example, he spends way too much time describing the geology of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies that the characters visit. It is clear that he is very knowledgeable about geology and chemistry, but he spends so much time dwelling on these repetitive discussions, at the expense of character development and plot detail. In fact, he is very weak when it comes to character development, in this book or any of the others that I have read.What I don't understand is that it should be an easy problem to solve... all it would take is for the editor of his books to point out to Baxter that he needs to significantly cut down on the repetitive hard science verbiage while beefing up the storyline and making the characters fuller, more sympathetic. If he can't develop the storylines better, at least streamlining the books would make them much better(Space is a good book at 500 pages, it would have been an excellent book at 250 pages). This is why Baxter has not yet reached the level of a Clarke or Heinlein. Those masters had the right blend of science and fiction in their SF. Baxter needs to work on the fiction part."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"My impression of Stephen Baxter is as an author who is fun to read for thinking of &quot;big&quot; ideas, and with very interesting science stuff, though his prose is sometimes a chore to work through. This book confirmed that.The strong point of this book is in its thinking about how waves of colonization might spread across the galaxy, and the specifics of what each species may have as its goals and methods. In particular I liked the idea of the light-speed limiting bubbles which would contain the expansion of any given species.But overall I found Baxter's vision for humanity (and other races) to be rather pessimistic. He doesn't find it very plausible that the species would be able to manage its expansion at sustainable levels. I found this depressing, a future in which it's assumed we're unable to resolve our problems like this.My other complaint was actually that there were actually too many big ideas in the book. He has so many neat settings on so many different worlds. They were so many scenarios, but not many examined in much depth. (An example of this is the collision of Nereid into Triton to gain its resources.) Neat ideas, but they were passed over too quickly. They were all necessary for the development of the plot, though, so I guess the alternative would be to write a mammoth book like Stephenson's Cryptonomicon."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Thank you, you other reviewers on this website. Without you, I would have understood far less of this book. Not being a sci-fi buff.This book has great value because it makes us realize how small we are, compared to the larger scheme of things. Where will we be when the the years in which this book is set (3800) come around? In Heaven, maybe?Which brings up the spiritual aspect of the book, which few reviewers mentioned. I got a sort of Buddhistic concept from the author's tone. This rather fits in with the fact that one of the protagonists is a Japanese woman, Nemoto, who lives from scene to scene in a metaphysical way. Also, the inhabitants of the Moon are Japanese.The Buddhistic element in the book is embodied in the idea that as humans, we believe we are separate and autonomous individuals. But maybe, like computers, we are just electronic impulses with an aggrandized view of ourselves. Pre-programmed at the factory, melted down and recycled when the newer generation of computers takes our place.Buddha taught something similar, didn't he? Dissolving the ego?In this context, there is a character in the book, somewhat minor really, named Dorothy Chaum. She was really the most interesting character, because she starts out working for the Pope trying to convert aliens and Extra-terrestrials.She ends up something far different than a practicing Catholic, something more like, what, a Buddhist? And when you're flying around from galaxy to galaxy, visiting Venus, Triton, a strange Earth, seeing and feeling all sorts of strange feelings, living too long, who wouldn't be a Buddhist by then? Anyway, there is little mention of Christ, but he must be flying around there somewhere also, wouldn't you think?Well, this book is worth reading, but only the patient will be able to finish it.

Manifold: Time was quite good, although certainly not his best work. Manifold:Space is written as if the same characters and context of the first book had branched off on a different timeline. So, same people, different stuff happens to them.The first part of M: Space is fairly typical Baxter: humans encounter aliens, aliens bring some good, some bad, human society changes, loner astronaut launches himself into deep space, yadda yadda yadda. But much of the book is quite...impressionistic. That is, scenes, characters, and plot points sort of ebb and flow. For much of the book, there simply is no clear narrative arc. Things eventually become clear--life emerges everywhere, but somehow the galaxy always wipes it out, forcing it to start again, and man and alien alike wonder how to survive that purge. But the journey to the end of the book is often pretty slow going. A tighter editor might have chopped 100 pages out of this with little loss.Baxter fans should find it worth a read, but I wouldn't reccommend it otherwise."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"This would've been a better title for this second installment in Mr. Baxter's series. Gone in &quot;Space&quot; is the face paced, entertaining read that drew me to &quot;Manifold:time&quot;.Malenfant returns with different personality in an aged body. However, his condition is what draws us in during the first couple of pages as a new adventure unfolds. Then Malenfant sets off and disappears for the next 300 pages(10 centuries). Meanwhile we are left with a book that becomes an incoherent collage of alien invasion and X-Files conspiracies on a grand scale. Sounds entertaining? Not! Mr. Baxter's writing is choppy and characters are so flat and typical we either forget them or want to forget them. And Mr Baxter doesn't fail to flood his story with them. Even when Malenfant returns to complete the novel he is the most uninteresting thing on the page.One of Mr Baxter's flaws is his attempt to make characters seem important inside a story that covers a period of 1000 to a million plus years. Even though humans can live for centuries, they don't propel or excite the plot like Malenfant and Cornielus Taine did during a few hours worth of story-time in &quot;Manifold: Time&quot;. Here the stage is filled with too much apathy to enjoy anything outside a few &quot;cool&quot; science-fiction ideas.The book is poorly written for several reasons. First, the are many subplots, many of which I admit are more interesting than the story itself, that spring up and fade away without materializing or reappearing to tie up loose ends. And the are a lot of loose ends and annoying, needless mysteries after 490 pages. Second, the story, which reads like a series of bad articles on moon mining and space colonization, has no real climax and never follows up what it promises on the first few pages. The are also plenty of similarities to current generic fiction, especially Babylon 5, Planet of the Apes, Star-Trek and Earth-Final Conflict. &quot;Manifold:Space&quot; on no page has the freshness and originality of &quot;Manifold:time&quot;.I gave &quot;Manifold:Time&quot; 5 stars because it left a big impression on my perspective and made me interested in a new area of astronomy(asteriods) I never cared for. &quot;Space&quot; only left me apathetic towards Malenfant's quest and weary of anymore of Mr. Baxter's writing.If you read &quot;Time&quot; and enjoyed it then you must feel you need to read &quot;Space&quot;, but there is no link between the plots or characters. &quot;Space&quot;, in my opinion, was a waste of time, but I can't not recommend it after recommending &quot;Time&quot;.&quot;Manifold:Origin&quot; from it's prologue that appears at the end of &quot;Space&quot; seems to be the book that will tie everything together. I'm reluctanct to pick it up after toiling through &quot;Space&quot; but I'm willing to give Mr. Baxter a second chance to make things right. After 900-plus pages into the series why quit now?Olaf Johnson NYC"},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Let me start by saying I am an avid Sci-Fi reader, the longer the book the better. I believe a good story takes a long time to tell ala Harry Turtledove. So when I read the plot and saw the book size, I thought I was in for a good read. I could not have been more incorrect. Here are my bullet points:1) Excellent plot idea, but I think Baxter forgot what is was after the first 12 pages. I have never been a part of such a plot trainwreck as this. Its like he compiled a dozen different stories into one without any of them going anywhere.2) Character developement was horrendous. He needs to take a lesson from Harry Turtledove or Kevin Anderson. Those guys can present twenty or more characters, make you remember and love each one, this guy can't do it with two.3) Science. About the only thing this guy can get across, but its not involving, its like reading a NASA technical paper, done with lots of coffee.4) Writing. He needs to take a lesson from Jack McDevitt. You need to make the book an incredible journey independent of the ending. I begged for the ending just to finish the book. If Nemoto was one thousand years old, I felt like it half way through the book. Baxter's writing style is cold and easily forgotten.The plot to this review, skip this book. It goes everywhere and nowhere all at once. I implore Baxter to work on his writing style and present more concise plot lines, eliminate all the extra about prehistoric men crapping on themselves on Jupiter's moon and stick to the plot. The editors need to quite screwing around and edit these books.

As for it being \\"hard\\" science fiction, the only thing I found hard about it was trying to read it. I bought this thinking I'd like to take a chance and try something new. Big mistake.I confess it had some cool scenes. When Malenfant (stupid name for a protagonist), find the first \\"Saddlepoint\\" (stupid name for the point in space where the sun's elliptical magnetic field meets itself way out there) beyond Pluto and he steps out of his little spaceship (powered by some hard pulse engine) and floats through the void to be sucked into the warp point. That was cool, I guess.Other than that this book stinks. The principal aliens are this race of assymetrical crab like machine things with appendages sticking off haphazardly and they're mining our asteroids to feed their never ending need for more and more minerals. Wow, now that's hard. They take Malenfant under their collective wing and show him around the galaxy. So the hero gets to see all the other lost and confused races populating the howling void. There was even one where stingray like beings lived swarming all over their asteroids while their dying pulsar sun created and destroyed them over and over in a neverending cycle of creation and destruction. I guess the author is as confused as the rest of us as to the utter indifference of the universe to our pathetic little lives.The author is no doubt intelligent and this shows as the holes in the plot are miles wide, as if he couldn't take the time to fill it in with scientific explanations his mentally inferior audience wouldn't understand anyway.To be fair, I wasn't able to finish the thing so I could be treating his work unfairly. Anyway, the topper for me and the reason I put it down forever was the female Japanese scientist who, for some reason, is able to live hundreds of years while the earth goes through a catastrophic ice age and we all revert to scattered tribes fighting over the only available land that's somewhere in Africa. And she is always being mysterious and won't explain things to Malenfant until the time is right. If I was Malenfant(what a stupid name) I'd ask her how the hell she lived to be a thousand!!! She's like an \\"ageless techno geisha of infinite understanding and mystery\\". And I was about as interested in this thousand year old inept as I would be in Mr. Baxter's bunions. I can't remember it, I don't want to remember it. Uhhhhhggg. Oh, and only the Japanese survive to prosper because they're able to mine the moon (thanks to corporate American daring and know how) and supply their happy moonbase for as long as need be.

De Vries was America's greatest humorist in the fifties and sixties, but in this work, he deals, from autobiographical experience, with his young daughter's struggle against leukemia. Overflowing with love, wit, fury, energy, and human grace, this book goes to the core of things. It ranks with the greatest works of 20th-century American literature, and it will surprise you. De Vries is best known for his great work for *The New Yorker* and for comedic novels (many made into films) rich in puns, the anatomy of absurdity, and the depredations and joys of libido....but *Blood of the Lamb* is his transcendent work. It's out of print now, and used copies are often hard to come by. It's an exceptional and humanizing experience. It is a moving sublimation of irredeemable tragedy."},{"Title":"THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB","review":"Writers--like artists of other mediums--often say that no novel or short story is really ever finished until it's read. As an old novelist friend of mine used to say, great fiction is always a C, never an O--that is, it leaves some open space for readers, space for us to bring our own lives and experience into the work and make it real or whole or alive.I finished Peter De Vries's Blood of the Lamb last night, for the second time. I read it initially sometime in the Sixties, four or five years after it was published, at a time in my life when I loved the irreverence he wields at his tribe--the Dutch Reformed people into which he and I were both born. De Vries mocked us but good, for our silliness and the sometime idiocy of our piety.Peter De Vries was, in his time, among the most well read and beloved of American humorists, his novels--most of them at least--knee-slapping satires of American life. Google him sometime and read a few of his finest quotes; he can be absolutely hilarious.There is humor in Blood of the Lamb too, Don Wanderhope and his father, aboard their garbage truck, slowly sinking like the Titanic into the primordial ooze of some Chicago-land refuse pit. Scared to death, they break out with--what else?--the doxology.But far and away, Blood of the Lamb is not a funny novel--not at all, even though forty years ago, when I first read it, I thought it was a hoot. But then, I was a kid, a rebel chafing under the strictures of De Vries's own ethnic and religious heritage, a heritage in process of cataclysmic change. It was the Sixties, after all, and little, if any of our lives were left untouched by the seismic cultural shifts of the era. At twenty, I read Peter De Vries's Blood of the Lamb and laughed.Forty years later, I almost cried.I'm a different person today--not nearly so headstrong, far less sure of my opinions and will. Forty years later, I've got scars, even open wounds, from the fisticuffs me and the Lord have come to. Forty years later, I read an almost entirely different book. The novel didn't change of course. Certainly, I did.Peter De Vries died in 1993, but I wonder if he ever guessed that of all his books, Blood of the Lamb would be the one that just won't go away. My guess is, he did. He wrote it just a year after the death of his daughter, who died at age 11 of leukemia; and much of the book, that which gives it its immense emotional heft, is the near recitation of the prolonged agony that child faced before eventually, finally, succumbing.* This novel's great lines don't come from his wit, but from his soul.Honestly, that whole story I had nearly forgotten because that theological fight simply didn't hit me at twenty. I think it was William Hazlett who said something to the effect of no young man thinks he shall ever die; count me among 'em. But at sixty years old, Blood of the Lamb nearly took out the knees in my soul.The story of Carol Wanderhope's agonizing death is the big story of the novel. Through his daughter's suffering, Don Wanderhope goes to war with a fully sovereign God, the author of our faith and our only comfort, for putting her through the horrifying paces of such inhuman suffering.The question to which De Vries demands an answer is the same question Elie Wiesel can't help asking in Night and elsewhere, one of the most profound and difficult questions all believers can ever face: if God almighty loves us and his love is blankets the known world, then why on earth do people suffer such great horrors? Peter De Vries's most memorable novel is not a book for the weak of heart--or soul.But it was a blessing to me, at sixty. It will be, I'm sure, the best thing I will read this summer."},{"Title":"THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB","review":"Very pleased that the University Of Chicago Press has brought this book back into print.

It is ultimately a book with a message, about stoic courage and grace, although not everyone is ready for the wisdom here. The book's ultimate message is that we should appreciate the moment and cherish those whom we love while we can.

The conclusion is remarkably moving. I have recommended this book to physicians in training to convey the incredible suffering experienced by families with ill children."},{"Title":"THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB","review":"Peter DeVries was a very popular writer who contributed many stories to the New Yorker in the fifties and sixties and who wrote several very funny novels. This autobiographical novel describes the growth to maturity of Don Wanderhope, member of a strickly Calvinist Dutch Reform family, whose brother becomes a heretic, whose father becomes addicted to drink and goes insane, and whose wife commits suicide after giving him a child whom he loves deeply. At age eleven, his daughter contracts leukemia, initially does quite well, but then succumbs to a staph infection in the hospital.Wanderhope - I suspect the name is no accidental choice - in grief stricken anger rails against God and man. \\"I made a tentative conclusion. It seemed from all of this that uppermost among human joys is the negative one of restoration. Not going to the stars, but learning that one may stay where one is. It was shortly after the evening in question that I had a taste of that truth on a scale that enabled me to put my finger on it.\\" The happiest moment of his life comes when the doctor lets him know that his daughter will be all right - a mistake as it turns out. \\"The fairy would not become a gnome. We could break bread in peace again, my child and I. The greatest experience open to man then, is the recovery of the commonplace.\\"The book has many humorous moments and profound insights, as Wanderhope struggles with religion as he tries to deal with the death of his only child.\\"I believe that man must learn to live without those consolations called religious, which his own intelligence must by now have told him belong to the childhood of the race. Philosophy really can give us nothing permanent to believe in either. It is too rich in answers; each canceling out the rest.. The quest for meaning is foredoomed. Human life means nothing. But that is not to say that it is not worth living. What does a Debussy arabesque mean, or a rainbow, or a rose? A man delights in all of these knowing himself to be no more. A wisp of music and haze of dreams dissolving against the sun. Man has only his own two feet to stand on his own human trinity to see him through: reason, courage and grace and the first plus the second equals the third.\\""},{"Title":"THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB","review":"I read this novel in its entirety after reading a condensed version in a Reader's Digest condensed books.

It is obvious that the author sat with a thesaurus next to him as he wrote, therefore the diction sounds stilted, and even cartoonish at times. Furthermore, the sentances are very choppy, and interesting passages are cluttered with extraneous information, such as the author calling his wife to let her know he'll be home late for dinner. It is also distracting that every conersation is reported with quotes and extra detail, as if dictiation were being taken at all times. We know this is not the case, therefore the reader cannot help but question the veracity of what else is being reported. In short, the author fails to achieve true credibility, simply because he invents unneccessary quotes and cannot compose a well-written sentance.What this book really needs is an editor, however somehow, it seems to have escaped all such efforts.If you can stand the atrocious writing &quot;style&quot; (and I use that term lightly), by all means, buy and read this book.

The story is engrossing, holding the reader's interest till the last page with unexpected developments in the plot up to the last chapter (even though the dialogue is a little flat toward the end). However, it is the underlying theological and philosophical currents that I found so fascinating and thought provoking. As the title suggests, the novel delves into questions of sacramental and ecclesial theology, particularly as they relate to the Eucharist. The fanciful context of an encounter with aliens allows Ekeh to raise questions about the nature of sacrament, salvation and church that might not otherwise be asked.This is a book that one can read simply for the story and have a good read. It is also a book that one can read a second and third time and still find something more to mull over regarding Eucharist and church. I haven't finished many works of fiction in the last few years, but this one I read in one sitting and then skimmed again because I found the philosophical and theological undercurrents so intriguing.

In a nutshell, the Plan is the road map to where you want to go and the Journal is your experience having taken the journey.

I bought a used book by Todd Lofton &quot;Getting started in Futures&quot; here on Amazon.It has 50 times more information, and would be really useful for beginners in futures."},{"Title":"Futures for Small Speculators","review":"I bought this book along with the companion guide and it was great. This book was small and I would have been disappointed had I not bought the companion guide too. The author was here in San Francisco doing a seminar and one of the things that he focused on was that trading was simple.The hardest part is managing a trade and that no matter how many people say his original book is too short...everyone still keeps making the same core ten mistakes.But I will say the companion guide to the book more than made up for it. Its almost 300 pages long and filled with the practical side of the information provided in the first book.I am going to buy the third book in the series."},{"Title":"Futures for Small Speculators","review":"Up until now many of the books I have read about futures and options investing have glossed over what it takes to succeed at futures.So many of them waste your time talking about the history of futures. They also get bogged down with the mechanics. For someone who has traded before it can be frustrating to go through 100 pages of fluff just to get to the author's point.Not so with this book. From the introduction on he keeps it brief and to the point. He also spells out his mission of wanting to see the small speculator succeed by giving you concrete tools. He talks of three a &quot;Futures Trading Plan&quot; a &quot;Futures Trading Worksheet&quot; and finally a &quot;Futures Trading Journal&quot;.He gives you ideas on how to modify these three tools to fit your trading style. He also points out that not every futures broker should be a futures broker. I can attest to that.Even though it's a small book I found it big on information. So I bought &quot;Futures For Small Speculators: Workbook&quot; and I was even further impressed. This book is based on a 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; format and has the three tools mentioned above layed out bare. There is a Futures Trading Plan questionnaire to photocopy and fill out, there is an actual Trading Worksheet to use, and built into the guide is a Futures Trading Journal.Great stuff here. It will definitely add to how you discipline yourself to trade the markets."},{"Title":"Futures for Small Speculators","review":"As other reviewers have said, the information is extremely basic, and available for free from many websites.Notice that all the reviews are either 1 or 5, nothing in between? In April 2009 DraKoln was advertising on the freelance contractor website, elance(DOT)com to PAY people to review his books as shown below:===========================================================Need reviews of my books on Amazon.com:Need several reviews of my books on Amazon.com will provide a pdf copy of the book for review. Need multiple reviews so I will be selecting multiple winners or if you are a group let me know the number of reviews that can be posted. Looking to increase exposure and sales.===========================================================Now, I don't know if that advertisement applied to this book or some of his others, but since he has displayed willingness to pay for good reviews, I suspect that some or all the reviews which gave him a \\"5\\" here and elsewhere may be \\"selected\\", purchased reviews - if not from elance, then from some other source.It's mildly entertaining to scroll through the 109 jobs Drakoln has posted on elance to find out that he's also writing non-finance books such as one about \\"the lives of ties\\" and a young adult fantasy book about genies. Also selling barbecue sauce.I believe elance allows it's members to remove job postings, so don't be surprised if you go there and find that the job offering for paid Amazon reviewers has be removed. I saved a screen shot in case anybody comes back to dispute me.Is it a legitimate practice to pay for Amazon reviews? I don't think it's legitimate, but I suspect it's more widespread than you might think."},{"Title":"Futures for Small Speculators","review":"One of the thinnest publications I've ever seen.

Pathetic."},{"Title":"Futures for Small Speculators","review":"Futures, options, derivatives have all been subjects I was afraid of learning about. I thought they were complex and impossible to get a handle on. When I decided that this might be an investment for me- I researched and stumbled across this book.It was clear and concise. The author emphasized in the intro that this book was supposed to be a supplement to any system I may already be trading and that it was his practical wisdom from being in the business for 10 years, both as a traded and broker.I took his statements at face value and was not disappointed! I was delighted at the simplicity of the ideas he presented and the concept of trading with a plan really changed my thinking. I liked the book and will be checking out his other books."},{"Title":"Futures for Small Speculators","review":"I almost listened to the one negative review of this book. Mr. Clifton is sorely mistaken that the information in this book can be found at the exchanges. His intentions seem honorable, but maybe his level of trading experience is so great that he has forgotten what its like for someone new starting out.My experience with trading has been limited to paper trading and the one time some boiler room broker convinced me that \\"this was going to be coldest winter ever\\" and loaded me up on heating oil options.Both times I received tons of information from the exchanges and most of it was simply confusing.Although this book was short it was chocked full of information that I could use today. I was able to weed out the boiler room brokers from the good brokers. Like the author emphasizes, I was given the use of three tools right away- a trading plan, a trade worksheet, and a trading journal.I have spent $200 on Ken Roberts course, then another $200 on Larry Williams course, and the information that I got ... by buying this book seems to be the last puzzle piece that was missing from both of these expensive courses.This book was well worth the costs and to be truthful I would have paid three times as much for this information. Like I said I am a novice-to advanced beginner and I loved the book. I am glad I ignored the one negative review and bought this book.

Women lack the ability to handle their money without a male counterpart, or a financial planner dictating to them how to invest for profit.

However, if your interest is in the Portuguese spice trade of 17th century India, this is your book.Rarely have I seen a book that uses and documents primary sources better than 'Twilight of the Pepper Empire'. The author makes use of 400 year old shipping manifests to compile a month by month account of the Portuguese spice exports from the Malabar coast. Every fortress and trading post the Portuguese built is documented in a level of detail I would not have thought possible given the obscurity of the primary source material. Even the secondary sources, usually more readily available to the general public, are such that I have spent two unsuccessful years trying to locate personal copies. Simply stated, this book is a testament to what a serious historian can produce.This is not 'Nathaniel's Nutmeg'. If you want a book to read by the fireplace this is not it. But as an historical text 'Twilight of the Pepper Empire' is top notch."},{"Title":"Starfleet Dynamics: A Starfleet Academy Reference Guide & Textbook (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition, ST VI: TUC, Stardate 9200)","review":"This manual was written before star trek the next generation and they were accurate with some of it such as the details on the appearance of the ships they also got quite a bit wrong with it. They filled in the blanks on physics that wasn't yet invented for the show. Example in the official manuals written by the crew of the television show \\"Star Trek the Next Generation\\" they talk about the ship generating subspace fields in order to submerge the mass of the ship so that slippage into faster than light may occur. While those who wrote this book talk about Hyperspace when talking about the faster than light space travel, as well as saying that trans warp being successful. If your a big fan of the series get it otherwise you won't enjoy it."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"Oregon State Detective Sergeant Colin Cellars is on administrative leave pending the results of a psychiatric examination following a strange X- Files-like incident. Since the events with the violet-eyed extraterrestrial, Colin is a true believer. As such, he has set an OUTER PERIMETER in his remote cabin in the mountains near Jasper Springs, Oregon to warn him of any intruder, especially serial killing aliens.Taking the death rate seriously, the state establishes two six-person teams of crime scene investigators to search the area for the serial predators. However, Colin believes that he and his three amigos (ex DEA Bobby Dawson, electronic guru Malcolm Byzor, and lab technician Jody Catlin) will ultimately be the team to stop the rising homicide rate and send an unfriendly ET home or die in the process.OUTER PERIMETER is an engaging, cleverly designed mixing of science fiction elements with a forensic-police procedural thriller. The exciting plot moves quickly forward with plenty of action, but references to the first book will, on occasion, leave the bewildered new reader first seeking evidence as to what previously happened. Overall, the spine tingling story stands alone as the fearsome foursome battles with a villain most likely not of this earth in Ken Goddard's latest chiller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"...if you read First Evidence. Not only does Outer Perimeter continue the characters, I think it was a better book overall!!! The writing style is perfected in Outer Perimeter and flow is incredibly strong.The book nearly made me call in to work sick in order to keep reading. (grin) Ken Goddard is one of my favorite authors and I strongly recommend starting with First Evidence and then continuing with Outer Perimeter.The way the book ends yields 5 stars in itself! Most books I read tend to fizzle near the end, or have a predictable ending. Outer Perimeter keeps you reading until the last page. Once you finish, you will wish there was more!!!Also, Balefire is an excellent book, especially considering the fact that it was written over 20 years ago and reads like it was recently written.Take my word for it, this guy is incredible!!!"},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"This is a fast-paced action book with lots of mysterious goings on by aliens and lots of involvement by state and county police officials who both believe and disbelieve the reports of abductions and disappearances of people in this small corner of Oregon.I think that whether or not you have read the first book in this series, you will be hooked and can't put it down until the ending. I know I was. The only disappointment is that when the ending comes, you don't want to let the story go. So, Mr. Goddard, when is the next installment? I sure hope there is one!"},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"When I read the jacket for this book I couldn't wait to open it and read it. Unfortunately I was quickly disappointed. I doubt I'll even bother to read the inevitable third volume in the series. The first problem is that nowhere in or on the book does it mention the fact that it is the second volume in a series. I had to find that out here on amazon.com. I felt like I was playing catch-up the whole time because I didn't know the beginning of the story. I also hate the author's habit of ending chapters at the peak of a dramatic moment, only to skip over the drama and tell about it third-hand later on. I like to read the exciting parts as they are happening, not relayed in the past tense. Finally, I just found the plot rather improbable. If you want to read a good novel of aliens hunting humans, read &quot;The Hunters&quot; by Burt Wetanson and Thomas Hoobler. An oldie but goodie."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"These aliens are truly scary and very believable. It would be a little hard to get started into this book if you had not read the first book but it can be done. This is a fast paced, action filled thriller. I stayed up til I finished it. I hope he writes another sequel soon!"},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"I liked First Evidence. But if I'd wanted to read it again, I would have. Outer Perimeter was little more than a re-hash with a subplot woven in. I'm a big fan of episodic fiction - following the same characters through DIFFERENT stories - with little or no reference to previous events. However, I had the feeling throughout Outer Perimeter that I was reading the next few chapters of First Evidence. It had very little of its own plot. When I got to the end just to discover the story lines, such as they were, weren't even resolved, I just had to throw up my hands. It's my guess the next in the &quot;series&quot; will be another weak subplot with the bulk of the book simply re-hash of the first two."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"Too long, too technical, too boring!

This book can be used in many ways for counting, multiplication, division and money. Were they too slow? You'll have to read to know."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"Would you like to teach math and entertain young elementary children at the same time? Here is a great book to help you do so! The story of One Hundred Hungry Ants was one that turned to be an exciting adventure for both myself and the 1st grade students I had read this fun book to. It contains phrases which continue throughout the story and some that students can repeat along with you, which helped make our adventure funny and enjoyable. It's a great way to get anyone you read to involved by the repetitive rhyme and rythm. This book can also teach or refresh students on what is being taught in the classroom, with counting from one to one hundred in multiples of 5 or doing so with rows. It can also help expand teaching on multiplication, addition, subtraction, and dividing. So if you want to enhance the fun in counting to one hundred in your classroom or in your home, grab a copy of this book and get your little ones involved!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"I read this book to my son who is almost six years old. He loves bugs, so this book instantly got his attention! He enjoyed how the words rhymed and how the ants say, \\"A hey and a hi dee ho!\\". Of course he didn't get the concept of division, but we counted how the ants went from one row, to two rows, to fours rows, and so on. This book was a lot of fun to read and was really enjoyed by my son. It would be great for those a little older who are learning division."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"In ONE HUNDRED HUNGRY ANTS a group of 100 hundred ants set out to a picnic marching in a line. Along the way, the smallest ant among them tells them they are moving to slow and if they divide into 2 lines of 50 they can get there faster. This process of division continues until the ants are in 10 lines of 10 and arrive at the picnic to find all the food is already gone. The story ends as the other 99 ants chase the 1 tiny ant away.As a book to help familiarize pre-school-2nd graders with division, ONE HUNDERD HUNGRY ANTS is a great book. The concept is clearly presented in a way children can grasp. Also, the story is basically a lengthy story problem and reading books like this can help children not be afraid of story problems. The illustrations are entertaining and kids will love looking at the picture (my favorite is the one where the ants walk by a snail who is carrying a strawberry on its shell). However, there are some who will not like reading this book to kids very much because the ants don't get a reward of a picnic at the end and the other ants chase the smallest one away. Personally, I like the idea because it also presents the idea of personal responsibility to younger children.Overall, ONE HUDNRED ANTS is an entertaining story that helps teach and reinforce the concept of division to children without them realizing it. The pictures are rather humorous and children will enjoy reading and having this book read to them. Recommended for children about 2 years to 7."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"This book not only teaches math (division and multiplication) it is really fun to read.from the catchy rhyming song, to the illustrations showing how even the turtles were already taking food by the time the ants arranged and re-arranged themselves.points to discuss with your child or students: why were the ants so late for the picnic? the answer can be a practical one - they wasted too much time rearranging themselves - or a mathematical one - one long line of 100 ants would get there faster than 10 lines of 10.why were the ants so angry at the littelest ant?also it's a good time to explain the characteristic of ants: they go in a single file and share everything.the other book \\"a remainder of one\\" was better, because it was a solution to a problem rather than a creation of a problem"},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"A nice simple story and simple math (division) about some ants.

The math just sort of sneaks in. Very fun to read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"Hated it! The ugly illustrations lack color, and lack soft rounded objects that are usually found in children's picture books. Also, the &quot;chaos&quot; pages did not effectively convey the ants realigning themselves. The story line too is awful because ants have the natural trait of traveling in single file lines -- they only do otherwise when scattered by outside forces. The worst thing about this book is that is has an unhappy ending, the hungry ants never get to eat; children expect and want a happy ending."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"This story reads really well with nice rhymes.

The ants on their way to a picnic held our attention with anticipation of how the ants were going to form thier lines. The 100 ants changed formation several times and it shows of all the possibilites there are with using different rows with the same 100 ants. It's a good way to introduce higher numbers and can include lessons on adding, multiplying and even subtraction since the little guy took off in the end. I found very enjoyable because of the cute repitional phrase that allowed the kids to feel familar with this book very fast."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"I bought this book after reading all of the positive reviews. I hate to be a grouch, but I am disappointed and will return the book for the following reasons: First, children need repetition to learn. Instead of merely showing the ants running around to rearrange themselves with each division and then going on to the next, the book should reiterate the new number of rows and how many are in each. More importantly, the message of the story is negative. It shows that the divisions were a waste of time, and the smart little ant who knew how to divide is scorned by all his ant-friends in the end. That is certainly not something I will read to my already math-apprehensive niece. Adults may be able to extract business lessons out of the story, as one reviewer wrote, but if the intent is to teach math concepts to young children, the message should be that math is useful, valuable, and fun. On a less important note, another reason I am disappointed in the book is that the rhyming meter is quite poor."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"We are learning different ways to skip count and find patterns in ways to get to 100. I read this to the students in class. They loved the book, the processing, and pictures. They were able to process and discuss the different patterns of the lines the 100 ants formed. Then they were able to relate this to coins in a dollar. They book is ideal for guided reading and discussion. It has rhythm, which is important for young children to recall concepts. It also it is a lot of fun. They enjoyed me reading to them, and then they wanted to hold the book and read it again to themselves.

The ants reap no reward for doing the smart thing and are even mad at the little ant that suggested dividing up. The ending implies that they would have made it to the picnic in time if only they hadn't wasted all that time dividing into shorter rows - ultimately not a positive math message at all.I like a good quirky kids story where thing don't end the way you might expect & not everyone is nice but this one falls short of quirky & just ends on a bad note."},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","review":"My son LOVES this book!

In fact, because of my mind-set, I saw this story as a great example of what can happen when leadership and strategic focus are not strong! While you may eventually get to your destination, will it be in time to reap the desired outcomes and rewards of your plan?

Basically, this book is written for the young bride who is leaving her parents' home for the first time. After a ceremony at their place of worship, her parents host a reception at their home. Nothing wrong with that kind of wedding, but if you intend any deviation from this plan, you'll get lots more information from a more up-to-date book. The original of this book was written in 1961, and it doesn't seem to have changed significantly since then."},{"Title":"Check list for a perfect wedding (Dolphin handbook original)","review":"I received this book as a gift for planning my wedding and used it religiously to make sure I did not forget any details. \\"Checklist\\" takes you through all the basics...etiquette, timeline, suggestions etc. The premise is, if you use the list and check off all you've finished and all that doesn't apply to you, you will have considered all the elements of a wedding. In the end, your careful planning and use of the checklist will reward you with a beautiful day that you will remember forever, and guests who are pleased that you anticipated their every need. (The book doesn't include decorating ideas, etc., so I purchased Martha Stewart Weddings MAGAZINE and used online resources.)"},{"Title":"Check list for a perfect wedding (Dolphin handbook original)","review":"This is just what you need to organize your thoughts, work out the details, and prepare for an absolely elegant wedding. I had very little time to spare, and this helped me figure out what I needed to do, by when, and for what. I can't wait to read the REVISED Version! It will be even better."},{"Title":"Check list for a perfect wedding (Dolphin handbook original)","review":"When Amazon teamed this book with &quot;With These Words...I Thee Wed: Contemporary Wedding Vows for Today's Couples&quot; for their &quot;Best Value&quot; sale, a dear friend was kind enough to buy both for my upcoming wedding. And without a doubt, this duel gift has served as the most useful in making my wedding the ultimate event I desired. A bit of a perfectionist, I wanted to express vows above the norm--romantic, yet realistic. Superior, progressive and unusual, yet from the heart. No small order. But &quot;With These Words&quot; exceeded my expectations and I created a vow that Ron and my guests will never forget! The only thing left was to make certain every wedding detail was attended to and that's where this checklist book saved the day! Yikes, perfectionist-me had actually overlooked some vital details. So if you want your wedding to become your greatest memory, get &quot;With These Words...I Thee Wed&quot; and &quot;Checklist For a Perfect Wedding&quot; and relax...your dreams will come true."},{"Title":"Check list for a perfect wedding (Dolphin handbook original)","review":"I was so excited to see the book I ordered to arrive is absolutely \\"perfect\\" condition.

I highly recommend Pamela Thomas's Bridal Guide."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"I am using this book for the second time around. It's still full of fabulous information.

I found the book useful already with my 14 month old and find that I need to reference it whenever new toddler behaviors decide to surface."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"I wasn't totally impressed with this book. It definately has some good points and advice and there is information to be learned, I just thought it was average in the format."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"Despite all the gushing reviews about this book, a lot of it was just plain old common sense. As a mother to an almost 3 year old toddler (who, by the way was toilet training at 19 months and finished by 21 months without coercion), I found the book somewhat tedious. This book is a compendium for newbies but not for those who are more experienced and looking for \\"new\\" or additional information.The section on toilet-training full of inaccurate old wives tales (from the 1970's when disposable diapers came into vogue). Too bad we DON'T take a cue from the 1960's and get our children OUT of diapers ASAP so that the landfills don't overrun with disposable diapers. It was offensive to those of us who don't wait until our child is 3.5 years old to toilet train them. Her assertion that toddlers aren't ready for toilet training until they can control the anal sphincter muscles is untrue. Children CAN be trained by 1 - 2 years old, or those Europeans, Africans and Asians are doing something wrong!She focuses too much on \\"fun and games\\" as if the toddler was not capable and interested in learning things like alphabets and counting (she makes it seem like if you do these things, you are an overbearing, overly ambitious and overly anxious mother). Do children HAVE to be entertained everywhere they go?There are better books out there. This is not one I would buy. I would recommend Infant Potty Training : A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living by Laurie Boucke for a better approach to toilet training. I would also not recommend waiting until your child was 3.5 either.BTW, I don't have to entertain my child. She does just fine on her own and is able to amuse herself everywhere she goes without lots of paraphernalia. I allow her natural curiousity to engage with what's out there."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"A great sequel to the previous &quot;Mother of All&quot; Books. I have had the pleasure of hearing the author give a presentation recently and found her to be very knowledgeable, supportive and funny. I really appreciate the humorous, true anecdotes of many parents with toddlers throughout the book. This is the key comfort factor for me that grounds this book in reality...that I am not alone in sometimes being unsure of what to do and occasionally regretting what I chose to do. I am often doubting that I am a good enough mother compared to some of my friends and relatives. The warm, friendly tone of the author, a mother of 4 kids herself, is carried through her books and helps calm my anxiety. I also wish to highly recommend &quot;The Pocket Parent&quot; by two authors that are also knowledgeable, compassionate, &quot;tell it like it is&quot; mothers. This book addresses just four years of life...the challenging behavior issues of 2, 3, 4, and 5 year olds and offers hundreds of tips and true, short anecdotes on handling every annoying behavior you can think of. Both of these upbeat, well-written, quick-read reference books are designed to be read as you need them...each chapter complete on its own...both books equally helpful to moms and dads of toddlers."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"I received this book and read it in one day - very easy to do, since the margins are huge, the whole text is in bulletpoints and it reads as if it came straight from the Internet.This title came up as a recommendation while I was looking at other parenting books. Since it was less than 11 dollars I decided to take a chance. Based on the number of pages, the title and the positive reviews, I thought that it would be a comprehensive book. And I was looking forward to a common-sense Canadian perspective from the author. A bust on all counts.As a parent of a 19 m.o., my feeling is that any other parent who has made it this far and has access to the Internet does not need to buy this book. I haven't read any of her other books, but this one was really poorly put together and edited. The transitions between topics were really weird, often sounding like a videoscript, but really strange in writing: \\"We've covered a, b and c, now we're going to move onto x,y and z.\\" These intros and transitions really bulk up the book. Poor editing. And this might sound really picky, but the phrase \\"dreaming in Technicolor,\\" for example, appeared at least three times.The quotes from mothers were sometimes interesting, but again, nothing I haven't already run across in my very short time as a parent. I just didn't learn anything new from the book, and as I said, I only have a 19 m.o., so anyone with an older toddler and common sense would probably be bored by this.Being a mother of four is great, but that alone is not a qualification for writing a book. If Ann Douglas has a particular area of expertise or a unique perspective about childrearing or parenting, I missed it entirely."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"While The Mother of All Toddler Books provides excellent information on all of the important topics that parents of toddlers need to know about, like discipline, health, nutrition, sleep, and healthy development during the toddler years, I felt that this book's greatest strength was the chapter entitled \\"Fun and Games.\\"The arts and crafts section of the chapter provides a detailed checklist of toddler-friendly craft materials (both homemade -- including recipes -- and tips on zeroing in on the best store-bought art materials for toddlers).You'll also find tips on planning art projects that are perfectly geared to toddlers (not too frustrating), suggestions on getting craft-related stains out of your toddler's clothes, and practical ideas about setting up craft activity centers in your home.The chapter also includes a number of suggestions for fun sensory play activities that you can try with your toddler (e.g., water play, sand play, snow play, modeling clay, cooking), along with music activities (including how to make your own musical instruments), dramatic play activities (dressup and puppet-making tips); fun excursions to plan; games that encourage your toddler to move his/her body; pre-math games to play with your toddler (sorting, matching, grouping, measuring); fun science games and activities (cause and effect toys, gardening); and activities like making your own books that encourage a love of reading.The chapter wraps up with a discussion of how you can get the best value for each dollar you spend at the toy store. That means buying durable toys, age-appropriate toys, toys that your child will be able to play with for many years, and toys that can be played with in more than one way.There are also some helpful (and money-saving) tips on cleaning and fixing toys that might otherwise end up in the trash, storing toys, and making your own toys, as well as a list of the best toys for toddlers."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Toddler Books","review":"How can you not like a book with this title?

The author constantly makes references that aren't explained, remarks on illustrations but doesn't make it clear on the photo what is being referred too, and generally talks about each subject, but doesn't necessarily always make a clear point.It's a handy book for the reference, but all that material is free online, so the price of the book weighs heavily on the balance of the material which in this reader's mind, is vague in areas that need specifics, and specific in areas that are free to the public anyway.I look forward to the second version though just the same. I feel guilty attacking the style of a clearly experienced engineer, but engineers in general know that they are a breed apart. The rest of us Laymen need more help.

David has access to some of the most incredible scenes of New York as he drives through the city year round and at all hours with his camera. His photographs catch the subtle changes in light, weather, and emotion of the city. And he sees it from the street level behind the steering wheel. I am honored to be his friend and this book to me is as exciting as the work Andreas Feininger did of New York city during the 30's and 40's."},{"Title":"Drive by Shootings : Photographs by a New York Taxi Driver","review":"I have never been to the Big Apple, though for as long as I remember, I have always wanted to go there.

As we pulled away, I noticed the driver had two small black and white photos (New York cityscapes) posted next to his hack license. The pictures were small but alluring in that New York noir sort of way. One was signed &quot;Bradford,&quot; the same name on the hack license. &quot;Cool photos,&quot; I said. &quot;Do you show?&quot; To which the driver said, &quot;My book,&quot; and he handed me &quot;Drive-By Shootings.&quot; The book is substantial, somewhere near 500 pages with thick paper to accomadate these extraordinary photos... Bradford has an alert and whimsical eye. Of all the photography I have seen of New York, Bradford's body of work captures the energy and essence of what it is like to be here and live here, better than any I've seen. There is enormous love for the city and compassion for his subjects. There is also present a strong sense of irony alongside the photographer himself being humbled by this thing --New York City -- which is depicted here as being as tame as it is wild. Like Bradford himself, this book is very engaging. If you like New York, or have an interest in photography or art, you'll appreciate &quot;Drive-By Shootings.&quot;"},{"Title":"Drive by Shootings : Photographs by a New York Taxi Driver","review":"a book of photographs (and some prose) done by a NY taxi cab driver. all the photos were shot with a point and shoot camera, while he was driving his cab.a great example of how a body of work is equal to more than the sum of the parts. in other words, the individual images are not necessarily masterpieces, but when you put them all together, the body of work could definitely be exhibited in a gallery. goes to show you that to be a successful artist, a concise body of work is more important then successful individual images alone.also, this book is a great example of taking one's circumstances and surroundings and creating something artistic from them. there's room for creativity everywhere, especially for photographic creativity.and in it, the author transcends what might be an ordinary job into something extraordinary. like a bumble-bee buzzing throughout the city, Braford in his cab with camera in hand shows us that in the wake of the events of 9/11/2001 (in fact, the World Trade Center buildings are in many of his shots), NYC is a city full of vitality, life, and soul.as a published photographer myself, and someone who has not yet spent much time in New York, i really appreciate this book. it's one man's view of the city, yes. but he has such a great vantage point as part of the livelyhood of it."},{"Title":"Drive by Shootings : Photographs by a New York Taxi Driver","review":"I found this book to be a true depiction of what it means to be in New York - not just the skylines and the tourist attractions.

The photographs were all taken with a Yashica T4 point and shoot camera, (the point and shoot of choice for most pro photographers)! The pictures are all in black and white too. The pictures are the pulse of New York City from the viewpoint of a New York Cabbie. I love this concept. I love that this man has used a wonderful point and shoot camera (now discontinued...shame on you, Yashica!), and how he photographs the city while driving. He also photographs the passengers (great idea!!). The text is fantastic. It lets you really understand where he is coming from when he took the pictures.

Kathleen Howard, a Canadian contralto and actually a gifted writer, studied in France and had a good career singing major roles in Germany before coming to the Met where she sang a wide variety of character roles, including Zita in the world-premiere of Gianni Schicchi. Her Met career was followed by years as a writer and then acting in Hollywood in film, notably with W.C.Fields. Her very well-written memoirs end with her return to North America but are filled with vivid recollections of her life and studies in Paris and then what it was like to be singing as a foreign singer in pre-WWI Germany with all the atmosphere and daily life in provincial and not-so provincial German opera houses She really creates a feeling of the somewhat halcyon time before the devastating war. I found the book highly readable and enjoyable, but then I love historical musical memoirs. Recommended if you do, too."},{"Title":"Confessions of an opera singer","review":"This was the second book I purchased to read, going across country on the train, for my new Kindle. Unlike 'Strangled Melody' which was set in the 1980's in America, this book purports to be the memoirs of a singer I had never heard of- an 'also-ran' who sang Contralto/Mezzo in some of the secondary Opera Houses in Europe, in the late 19th, and early 20th Century.Like many works of this genre, the writing is not stellar. It is not, however, merely a recitation of facts, dates, and famous royalty met and/or courted. This woman loved her family, yet loved her art more. She left America for the 'career in Europe' back when that meant something, and proved herself, both to the chauvinistic Germans of the era, as well as to herself, and the critics. There are moments for a historical Opera buff, that bring to light (even if just for an instant) famous composers, and (yes!) even the Royalty of Europe, that perished in the Great War (WWI).I am glad this book has been preserved on the Kindle format. There is no need to republish this in paperback. It is not worth the time and effort. It is not a Flagstad, or a Robert Merrill bio, of the greatest of the Greats. It is not even on the level of a Louise Homer, but it IS a record of one American singer's life and times. For that, it was worth the writing."},{"Title":"Confessions of an opera singer","review":"I first encounted Kathleen Howard as Amelia Bissonette (that's Bissonay; don't let her catch you calling her Bissonette!) in the W.C. Fields film It's a Gift She makes the bedroom scene with him into an all time classic (\\"Why are they calling you from the maternity hospital at this hour of the night?\\") She played the same role in The Man On the Flying Trapeze as Leona Wolfinger(\\"Hurry, Ambrose, there are burglars singing in the basement.\\") to his Ambrose Wolfinger(\\"What are they singing?\\") . She was the perfect foil for Fields who played the henpecked husband in both movies.After that, Fields nearly died and had a long recovery. Meanwhile, she moved on and worked fairly steadily although she dropped downward in the credits. One of her notable roles in a later film was as the bossy maid in the Barbara Stanwyck film Ball of Fire in which Stanwyck broke Howard's jaw with a sucker punch in a staging accident. She did have one television credit in 1951, which was the end of her acting career.So who was Kathleen Howard? This book is most of what information is available about her. It is the story of a young girl growing up in the Gilded Age who obviously had parents of some means and who developed an early love for the opera. So much love for the opera that she broke off a marriage engagement with a young man when he didn't take her aspirations seriously. So much love for the opera that when she saw little opportunities to learn opera in the U.S., she went to France to study opera. When she didn't find enough opportunity to perform there she went to Germany, learned to speak and sing in German quickly. She got her first job in Metz, which was then in German hands. During her years in Germany, she visited her brother, Cecil Howard, a sculptor in Paris. It also includes pictures of her in costume for her various roles and how the costumes evolved.Now, candidly, I'm not a fan or knowledgeable in opera. Victor Borge's gag with the high note of the soprano knocking him off the piano bench hits pretty close to home. I am familiar with the orchestral scores but not the stories nor the costumes and staging. Her account of launching her career and what it took to work in opera at that time was colorful in detail and mostly easy to follow. The culture of the opera at that time was completely new to me, but I get the feel of how a young girl growing up at that time could aspire to become an opera diva. The book ends with her return to New York, her marriage to Edward Kellogg Baird, and his formation of an opera company in New York including her. But, she notes at the very end that the opera company failed and she landed a role in the Metropolitan Opera.After this book ends, according to other sources her opera career ended in 1928. She and her sister Marjorie, who accompanied her on all her other adventures, became writers and editors at Harper's Bazaar Magazine. After she completed her first film, Death Takes A Holiday, she resigned from the magazine and pursued an acting career in Hollywood. Her husband died in 1951, she and her brother died in 1956.It probably would be bittersweet for her that she is remembered mostly for the W.C. Fields films but her book does put that into perspective. Her story is a first hand account of Gilded Age America and also of Europe between the Franco Prussian War and World War I."},{"Title":"God in patristic thought","review":"I am so happy to see this book available once more. Prestige is a master of the subject and he writes with a clear style that helps something as technical as Greek philosophy and Christian theology come alive. He assembles the evidence for what the Greek Fathers, the men whose constructive thought underlies the creeds, really thought and taught about the nature of God. It shows that they were original thinkers, with a profound reverence for the text of the Scriptures, and minds keenly trained to discuss what ultimate truths were expressed in the scriptural text and what reality should be ascribed to Christian religious experience. The results indicate that a good deal which is assumed in current theological text-books needs to be revised. The Fathers had to reconcile monotheism with faith in a Trinity of divine Persons. In the process, they pursued many lines of inquiry, often only to discard them after trial, but after following various clues and making various intellectual adventures they reached a solution to the problems, which was both true to their data and philosophically reasonable.Though the bulk of the book is concerned with the third and fourth centuries, during which the creeds were in the process of formulation, the story is carried down to the eighth century. It is shown that a great change came over the philosophical tradition during the sixth century, and owing to the consequent growth of formalism, a genuine outbreak of tritheism occurred. The book ends with the account of how this outbreak was met and overcome, largely through the efforts of a thinker whose very name is unknown, and whose book has only survived under the name of another man.Table of contents:1.

It is a superb piece of scholarship. Specifically, this brilliant book relates the Course's thought system to that which underlies many of the Gnostic movements of the early centuries of Christendom, along with Platonism and Neo-Platonism. Dr. Wapnick has done students of the Course a great favor by providing this information, which can only serve to enhance the Course's credibility in the years to come, not least in the face of the growing dysfunctionality of &quot;orthodox&quot; Christianity."},{"Title":"Love Does Not Condemn: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil According to Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"Even though I'm not an \\"A Course in Miracles\\" follower, this book is really a gem. Although this book is directed to Course students, it explain very thoroughly and rationally the relation between Ancient Christianity, Platonism, Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism. There is only one small flaw in all of this: it looks at \\"A Course in Miracles\\" as Jesus' original message, and hence he views Gnosticism very close to Jesus' original message in its metaphysical level. It is very interesting that he looks at the Gnostic's own mistakes as those which Course students frequently fall into.Other than that, he chooses Bible translations very well; he chooses the appropriate Bible scholars, he chooses good authorities on the issue of Gnosticism, he shows the pertinent passages of philosophy authors (Plato, Aristotle, Philo, Plotinus), and shows the historical, social, political, religious realities of Christianity, Ancient Philosophy, Gnosticism and how they are related to each other.I have an MA in Philosophy, and not a scholar.

One of the aspects I found most helpful was the clear dilemna Wapnick brings to the fore: until you can come to terms with how evil and man's apparent separation from God came into existence, all spiritual thought systems are meaningless.

The book reflects this wealth of knowledge and experience.You should know that at least 90% of this book, and perhaps more, is centered around electricity production through the use of solar panels. Wind generators are mentioned, but only briefly - as in a few paragraphs, and one picture; and other important solar energy topics, such as the use of solar hot water systems, are barely mentioned. The importance of heat conservation through upgrading insulation and the use of triple pane, low-e argon filled windows is not mentioned at all. This is particularly disappointing, because for most climates in North America, ranging from the very cold to the very hot, reducing energy losses through passive insulation is one of the most cost effective things the average person can do. You get more bang for your buck through insulation - in most cases - than any other solar energy upgrade you can perform. But Yago doesn't mention this fact.(Think you don't need insulation, because you live in Arizona? Well, more insulation keeps the heat out, and the cold in, better. Something to consider, when you next pay the electrical bill for running your air conditioner.)I would like to have seen plans for a do it yourself domestic solar water heater; but they're not here. A solar oven can be easily constructed, and is a very inspiring and educational way to learn about the power of the sun; but there's nothing in this book on the topic. Solar showers can be easily constructed, or even inexpensively purchased commercially; but you won't find them mentioned here. There's no indication of how much insulation to use in your home's walls and ceilings, and there's no discussion of how much heat loss occurs through regular windows. There's nothing on passive solar gain through the use of Trombe walls, and no information on heat storage through the use of water or rock mass. Electricity generation through the use of small hydroelectric units is barely mentioned (as in, yeah, you can do it). But you won't find any discussion of height versus water pressure, or suppliers of hydro generation units, or cost/benefit ratios (how much water do I have to have flowing, from what height, before hydro units are a better value than solar panels?)In short, the book confines itself to the topic of ELECTRICITY conservation, and ELECTRICITY generation - and that, primarily through the use of solar panels and gasoline generators, often connected to the grid through utility intertie systems.For the beginner, this is a good book. The information, although very limited in scope, is correct; and Yago's experience in this small aspect of solar power is quite evident. His information regarding batteries - selection, housing, charging, equalization - is important for those new to solar power.(One important point: Yago states that homeowners should replace their existing light bulbs with replacement florescent lighting. He's correct; the payback is dramatic. But Yago also states that hallways and rooms should be equipped with motion sensor switches, that turn on the lights when you enter and turn them off when you leave. The trouble is, most motion sensor switches of this type will not work with florescent tubes; and of the few that do, none will work with the electronic ballast, screw in replacement florescent bulbs most likely to be used by the consumer. They'll cause the switches to overheat, burn out, and represent a fire hazard. This is mentioned in the fine print on the switch; so, if you go this route, make CERTAIN that the motion detector switch is compatible with an ELECTRONIC ballast, florescent fixture. I don't know of any that are.)(UPDATE: Scott Ermatinger found one at Smarthome - do a Google Search to locate their website. So finally, it is an option, although at $55 each it's a somewhat expensive one. Thanks, Scott, for the information!)Other, more detailed books on solar electrical power have been written by David Smead, who runs a company called Ample Power. While Smead tends to center his books on the boating industry, most of the issues that face an off grid homeowner are the same as those faced by a cruising boat captain. Smead's texts provide a wealth of factual information on batteries and electrical generation, and should be read by anyone intent on doing solar power. They can be daunting, however; Smead is a very high level engineer, and has designed a few items for solar power which have become widely used - and copied - throughout the industry. You should familiarize yourself with his books and products.For those looking for more general information on achieving energy independence through solar power, check out the many books written or published by Real Goods, and available through Amazon. Real Goods covers many more of the bases than this book does. Do keep in mind that Real Goods is a commercial retail mail order store; they sell stuff. Even so, I've found their information to be factual, and wide ranging. Becasue of their commercial orientation, I'm always concerned that their information will be designed to sell products, rather than educate consumers; but in truth, I have not found this to be the case.Yago's book is NOT complete. You will NOT leave this book with all the information necessary to order and construct your own solar power system. It is more of a general, 30,000 foot overview of electrical energy conservation and production through the use of solar panels.I would recommend this book to individuals new to the solar power movement, who are seeking a broad, non-detailed overview of power production and storage through solar panel usage. It is by no means a one stop shop; you'll need to read many other books to become a solar power guru. But Yagos' book is informative, fairly accurate, and factual - as far as it goes.It just doesn't go very far."},{"Title":"Achieving Energy Independence - One Step at a Time","review":"Jeff Yago's book is a great tool for solar experts to use when teaching homeowners or training electricians and solar contractors new to the business.

Despite the fact that some of the women have different backgrounds than my own, there was something in each woman's experience I could ALWAYS relate to.

At times I felt bogged down by the sheer physicality of it all, and longed to make it a more spiritually uplifting experience. I also wished I had other obsessive-compregnant women to talk to, so we could all take turns inspiring and/or boring each other. Reading EXPECTING MIRACLES filled all these gaps in my pregnant life! It was all I wanted to read. Women from various walks of Jewish religious life are telling you all the intimate details of their experiences as pregnant ladies and then as mothers and as wives. They give all sorts of ideas, suggestions and encouragement to make it more spiritual. YOu think, I could do that. I want to try that. I couldn't put this book down. It is a MUST-HAVE alongside WHat to Expect When You're Expecting. Expecting Miracles is like the spiritual counterpart to that sometimes too-physical (and occasionally scary) pregnancy guidebook.

He records the scene outside the train window or porthole like no one else. Close to poetic in some sections.I have read almost all of Theroux's books and when I picked up this one I was afraid it would just be excerpts from his travels and might be less than satisfying, the tales taken out of conntext. I was wrong. These stories are gems in their own right, timeless, and may inspire you to read more of his books, fiction and nonfiction."},{"Title":"To the Ends of the Earth: The Selected Travels of Paul Theroux","review":"This book is a collection of episodes, usually not connected, from six previous Theroux books published in the 70's and 80's. His travels in five different continents are highlighted here with varying degrees of detail. Since his other books describe distinct journeys from beginning to end, Theroux explains in the intro here that this book is meant more as a celebration of the art of traveling itself. He also has some snide insights into the art of travel writing, especially annoying authors who give only a tourist's eye view of the destination but don't bother to say how they got there. Getting there is Theroux's passion and the fragments in this volume usually show him encountering all kinds of intriguing characters and situations around the world, all while on his way somewhere else. That includes the good, the bad, and the ugly - and describing all of these with equal insight is Theroux's greatest strength as a globetrotting non-tourist."},{"Title":"To the Ends of the Earth: The Selected Travels of Paul Theroux","review":"I write that as my intro because this is a collection of selected works from several of the author's travels.

It features selections from The Great Railway Bazaar, The Old Pantagonian Express, The Kingdom by the Sea, Riding the Iron Rooster, and more rare bits from Down the Yangtze and Sunrise with Seamonsters. If you read it and do not like it - fine. But if you read it and love it, then you might spoil highlights of books from which these writings were taken. What is perhaps Theroux's best travel book, The Happy Isles of Oceania, is not featured in To the Ends of the Earth. Neither is Dark Star Safari (which I think is his weakest one), The Pillars of Hercules (outstanding), or Ghost Train to the Eastern Star (a very good encore to the book that made him famous and set the standard for travel writing). If you're a fan of Theroux, this book makes a nice collector's piece. If you're a neophyte, it's really hard to go wrong with Paul Theroux.

For someone who has not read any of his books - well, unfortunately this book would not encourage them to buy the full texts. I don't think it does justice to his writing or his travels. Too short - each story.The books in their entirety draw you in and make you live the experiences with him. I adore his books and his writing style. I love his full texts.

She views life at 70 as a survivor and considered herself lucky to still be acting at all.Ms. Bacall does not know what she would do with herself if she did not work. She views working as a reason to get up out of bed, if your working you can pay the bills.

She is more in love with her grandchildren from her sons Steve Bogart and Sam Robards then she ever thought possible.She has realized late in life that she needs her children which surprises her. She examines all the fears that she went through in getting a country house in Amagansett. Once she had it then she spent years continually making as many changes to it aspossible. In the end when she sold it she realized she had spent more time living in other places than this house.She recognizes that the older she gets the more difficult it is for her to be able to still get great roles, she realizes that work is much harder physically.

This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \\"Black politician.\\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \\"raise yourself by your boot strap\\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \\"the Great Booker T. Washington.\\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \\"accommodationist,\\" \\"or \\"the great compromiser,\\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \\"Uncle Tom,\\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \\"selling his people out.\\" By making a \\"virtue, out of personal necessity,\\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \\"manual arts,\\" and \\"the trades.\\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \\"stooge\\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \\"the white man,\\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told.

He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money.

Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \\"World of Yesterday\\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it.

He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM!

So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting? He didn't escape a slave or anything like that, he was emancipated like everyone else and then went to school like many people did--nothing interesting.

As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong?

This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Very interesting perspective on slavery from someone who actually lived through it.

Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T.

Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a 16 year old female...Upon looking through the history section of the store I discovered &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book.Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success.&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington and his role in shaping the free life we as americans, live today. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \\"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \\"freedom\\" meant \`I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \\"live by their wits\\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \\"made it\\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \\"made it.\\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \\"a job well done.\\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \\"Talented Tenth\\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \\"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \\"educated fool\\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \\"But we've come so far!\\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \\"reverse engineer\\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \\"accommodating Uncle Tom\\" and get to work."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound.

Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur.

It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line.

The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book.

Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \\"A Slave Among Slaves\\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \\"The Great Accomodator.\\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T.

I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself.

WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington. I recommend it to young kids who enjoy reading about history and how the slaves were freed."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"i love this book its one of the best books i have read in a long time.It deals with real life problems,and how we can get through them with some encouragement."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"In 1901, Booker T. Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic. If you want to read a book that is a window on the America of the late nineteenth century, or if you want an uplifting book about a man of faith and love, then I highly recommend that you get this book!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I was very impressed with this book, it is well worthreading and makes you think just how much change for the better has occurred because of the effort of one incredible man."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did, anyone can. i'd give it 5 stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"What can I say!

There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Ebook came in a timely fashion!

Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about.

Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \\"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \\"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \\"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful.

Great for doing a book report."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \\"least offensive\\" is another reader's \\"Uncle Tom\\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"This autobiography of an African American intellectual will inspire you.

READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept.

This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Booker T.

Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \\"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves. Being born a slave was a major set back in their lives. Booker was determined to received and education at any cost, and he succeeded. Nothing was handed to him. Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race. Together they worked to build one of the finest educational institution in the south-Tuskegee, renamed Tuskegee University."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \\"bringing up the black race\\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \\"Up From Slavery\\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \\"Up From Slavery\\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \\"offensive write-up\\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \\"critical\\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \\"lacked depth\\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \\"Up From Slavery\\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in early American history."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \\"Up From Slavery\\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \\"Up From Slavery\\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \\"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \\"Up From Slavery\\" \`s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \\"Up From Slavery\\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"This book has opened my eyes to the socialization of the so called \\"Negro \\".

In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering.

In other words, those who don't cause trouble. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; displays this side of Mr. Washington. This book is worth reading because of Booker's determination that allowed him to rise above his former conditions. Yet, one can't help but get the feeling that he is all-to-ready to forget what has happened to him. Booker continues to explain, rather naively, in my opinion, how racism is to soon be erased.

He does, on the other hand, describe the tiny dimensions to the cabin where he lived and what life was like for the slaves.

What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students.

A previous book I reviewed made me curious about how the black slaves in the south lived before their emancipation. This book satisfied my curiosity. More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \\"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \\"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (A Bantam pathfinder edition)","review":"Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \\"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\\"Booker T.

Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was \\"learn a useful trade.\\" As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book!

I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them.

In this day of cell phones, SUV, satellite TV, computer networks etc just how isolated can a house in the English countryside be? Still other stories are dated in a very charming way, and lead the reader back to a far different time. This 1935 novel takes us back to a day when air travel was very different from today. A plane of 21 passengers had 2 pilots to fly from Paris to London and 2 stewards who served five course meals.The story opens with Poirot embarking on a flight between Paris and London. He and the other passengers settle themselves for the journey, marred only by the presence of a stowaway wasp which is quickly killed by one of the passengers. The situation changes when a steward tries to wake one of the passengers in preparation for landing. She has died during the flight.Poirot sets out to solve the crime which appears to have been committed by using a dart tipped with snake venom shot from a blowgun. All the passengers are under suspicion and have lives that are surprising intertwined. The trail leads Poirot from London, to the English countryside and back to Paris with inquiries stretching halfway around the world. In the end Poirot is, of course, triumphant. He even manages to help true love along the way.Even though this is very much a period piece the mystery is intriging and Christie comes through with one of her characteristic surprise twists."},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"A typical Christie from the 1930's (ie. well plotted and thought out, clever puzzle, easy to read, not very taxing on the grey cells, and fun.) As Poirot himself comes under suspicion at the inquest into the death of a passenger on the Prometheus, he investigates the victim's business dealings and suspects more than one fellow passenger was connected to the dead woman. The copy I read contained a floor plan of the airplane, which really made no difference to the solution, but was a nice touch anyway. The solution at first seemed to stretch coincidence a bit far, but Christie manages to explain things logically after all. A good choice for mystery buffs who just want a light read."},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"\\"Death in the Air\\"--also titled \\"Death in the Clouds\\"--is a historical mystery set in 1934 in England and France. (Of course, it was a contemporary mystery at the time it was written.)The mystery was intriguing because it could have gone several ways as to whodunit. I guessed several elements of the \\"big reveal\\" about whodunit, and there were enough clues that you could guess whodunit (though I caught them partly because I've read so many Christie mysteries). The characters were interesting as was the unique setting for the murder, but mainly it was the puzzle of whodunit that kept me interested.There was no sex. There were some explicit bad words and swearing. Overall, I'd recommend this intriguing mystery."},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"OK, so I have had this book hanging around for a while, and it is out of print, but having just read it and loved it, I thought I would write this review. This is classic Poirot. First the murder occurs in the first chapter, which is great, because there is no waiting around. All the suspects are clearly identified, and each has a motive. Essentially, a french women of some intrigue and power is murdered on an air ship. Her murder appears to have been caused through poisoning through a blow pipe. After that Poirot goes to work, identifies the motives and engages in a bit of trickery. Anything more would spoil the plot. Needless to say, however, an excellent little mystery."},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"Agatha Christies \\"Death In The Air\\" is not generally regarded as one of her best detective novels. However, on re-reading it recently I think it rates among her best.The story begins with a woman being murdered in a passenger aircraft over the English Channel. None of the other passengers (including Hercule Poirot) in the cabin witnesses the murder. In fact they swear no one came near the victim. Aha! The good old impossible crime!The plot is excellent; the characters are satisfactory; and Miss Christie's humor is delightful. This is a \\"fair play\\" mystery -- all the clues are presented to the reader, and Poirot's hints are right on the mark. Nevertheless, very few readers will spot the murdered before the final explanation.The story has one major gaffe that I won't mention for fear of spoiling the plot. In a later book Miss Christie, in her Ariadne Oliver persona, apologizes to her readers for her mistake.So sit down, relax, let your mind go back 70+ years to the early days of commercial aviation, and enjoy \\"Death In The Air\\". Bonus points if you spot the gaffe."},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"This book is a must read for any serious Hercule Poirot fan. Aside from &quot;Lord Edgware Dies,&quot; I would rate this book as one of Agatha Christie's better works. A MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"Do you want to read a good book with twists and turns to the resolution? Do you want to pick up a book and not put it down until you are finished? Death in the Air by Agatha Cristie is the perfect match for you. It is a classic mystery published in 1977.I thought Death in the Air was an average book. At the beginning of the book she introduces too many characters at one time. I also did not like that every so often throughout the book she used French words. For example, \\"...I do not wash out- what a term, mon Dieu!\\" (Pg. 55) I enjoyed that every character had a different personality and the murderer ended up to be someone you would have never suspected. After reading this book, I would conclude that it was very well written, and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries."},{"Title":"Death in the air","review":"Poirot is flying for the frist time.

An introductory chapter details the artist's attempts to find his unique style and his final decision to give up a life long career as a banker to become a professional artist. The book is lavishly illustrated with full-page paintings and is a worthy precedent to the highly successful book written by John himself a few years later.

That's okay. I liked the book because I identified with the people mentioned who work in so-called &quot;fringe science research.&quot; &quot;Void&quot; explores the emotions and psychological tensions experienced by many researchers for doing unusual research and for taking a path of life-employment not considered &quot;normal.&quot; Not a &quot;normal science career&quot; was the same life-employment for Dr. Brian O'Leary, too. The choice has caused him strain.If a reader doesn't appreciate this book, my guess is that either it's too much in the head of the author or it doesn't ring bells of similarity to one's experience. In fact one high recommendation to read this book &quot;is&quot; that it effectively conveys the emotional feelings and turmoil that Dr. Brian O'Leary has gone through for jumping off of a mainstream science position into the unknown area of New Science. New Science investigates U.F.O's, prayer, free energy, phychic experiences, and so on.It's interesting to read of the mental struggles Dr. O'Leary has gone through. This book is something of a journal and a catharsis for him. Dr. O'Leary even applies the research lives of some in the book, like Bruce and John Klingbeil of Spindrift Research, as models to avoid if one gets very depressed in their research attempts. A theme in &quot;Void&quot; is mental depression and what can one do to avoid depression when the world is telling you that your pursuits are insane or at least abnormal.A reader should be interested in this book for no other reason than it is so unusual and psychological that one will walk away with information he didn't know he didn't know."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Void: Free Energy, Ufos and Other Scientific Revelations","review":"The book &quot;Miracle in the Void&quot; had an emotional impact on me because I know of the personal struggles some of the explorers mentioned in the book have gone through.There was much psychological struggling described in Dr. O'Leary's book. Dr. O'Leary applied as models the life-experiences of some people who explore &quot;so-called fringe sceientific research.&quot; Some of these people were models of what to avoid in Dr. O'Leary's own life-experience. That is, if some researcher fell into a mental depression because of the negative way he was treated for doing fringe research, Brian O'Leary writes that such a reaction provided a hint of what psychological reaction to avoid himself. Brain O'Leary didn't want to get too depressed himself. And depression is a theme in this book.Dr. O'Leary has more descriptions of New Science theory and experiments in his other writings. However, &quot;Miracle in the Void&quot; is a stand-alone book, to the best of my knowledge, of the psychological warfare with others and with one's self many people with &quot;far-out&quot; ideas go through.I liked the book. It's psychological all the way through. It wonders more about the mental states of people rather than the altered states of people! The book is almost a journal of what Brian O'Leary has noticed in his contacts with those researching the unusual.Dr. O'Leary's book is an emotional ride. His writing hit me as a &quot;catharsis&quot; of all the emotions he has experienced by jumping off the mainstream of science into what is called New Science.As I said above, one good reason to read this book is, it may be the only one of its kind. What do I mean? Rather than going deeply into psychic and spiritual phenomena, Dr. O'Leary goes into the psychological states of people who promote their unusual experiences with free energy, prayer, consciousness, UFO's, and so on. I didn't anticipate what the book was about. That should peak one's interest in reading it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Void: Free Energy, Ufos and Other Scientific Revelations","review":"Brian Todd O'Leary (born 1940) is an American scientist, author, and former NASA astronaut, who was a member of the sixth group of astronauts selected by NASA in August 1967. A remote viewing experience in 1979 and a near-death experience in 1982 initiated his departure from traditional science---particularly once he refused to work on military space applications.He wrote in the Preface to this 1996 book, \\"This book completes my new science trilogy, an exploration which has taken me all over the world many times for a decade. My quest has been to witness demonstrations and experiments on concepts that transcend our current scientific worldview (paradigm) of reality.

This book deals with both the suppression and the promise of free energy and other scientific revelations.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"The independent work a number of us outside of NASA have carried out reveals strong, but not yet conclusive, evidence for the presence of artifacts of an intelligent civilization on Mars.\\" (Pg. 42)\\"As recently as two years ago, I was in denial about free energy. Ten years ago I denied UFOs. My bias was reflected by an erroneous assumption I made that I would have known about it if it were real and that my scientific colleagues know best.\\" (Pg. 52)\\"We have not only separated church from state and made both incomplete visions of our reality. We have also separated state from state.\\" (Pg. 59)\\"My anger first appeared a few years ago when I witnessed the death of purpose of NASA... the agency has conducted several missions in secret. I have witnessed its illegal, unethical practices to cover up and officially ridicule evidence about the Mars anomalies, for example...\\" (Pg. 64)\\"Even though scientific details of such channeled information remain to be verified, the essence seems to ring true, and the scientific evidence continually points in that direction, especially in cases where we can observe prophecies being fulfilled, such as those of Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce ... the Mayans and the Hopis.\\" (Pg. 166)\\"Dreams, events, and the environment are telling me that 'Miracle in the Void' completes a trilogy of books. The message in all three is clear; science must be expanded now to embrace a far greater reality.\\" (Pg. 195)"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Void: Free Energy, Ufos and Other Scientific Revelations","review":"Readers expecting useful information on the book's subtitle, &quot;Free Energy, UFOs and Other Scientific Revelations&quot;, will be disappointed, Although a scientist, O'Leary is light on the science of free energy. He is far more concerned with death, consciousness, personal introspection, transcendence, parapsychology and resurrecting Gaia than in offering a strong explanation of advances in energy technology.

The new book had it's usual effect on me and I went into a &quot;Griffin feeding frenzy&quot; and re-read the last two books in The Corps&quot; series.I rated this book &quot;5-Stars&quot; solely on the basis of the main plot--the support of guerrilla warfare activities in the Phillippines and the story of Wendell Fertig. I happen to like Ken McCoy and Ernie Zimmerman as central characters in all of The Corps novels. It is too bad that Griffin has elevated Fleming Pickering to such prominence in the more recent episodes;I prefer a more action-dominated story line and some of the &quot;fluff&quot; involving the O.S.S. involvement leaves me cold. My biggest criticism of the book is the relatively slow pace of the action. Too much time spent on wrangles with Bill Donovan and the O.S.S. hierarchy and Fleming Pickering swilling scotch. Some of these other criticisms might make the book less compelling for other readers,but I decided to overlook a few warts in my rating. I am tired of only one book in The Corps every 2-3 years. It is by FAR the best series the author has going. I can't abide the Cop series and I am thoroughly tired of Argentina. Stick to the Marines--forget the rest."},{"Title":"Behind the Lines","review":"I can't believe that Mr. Griffin has done it again. This book kept me on the edge from start to finish.

My only critism is: why isn't McCoy getting the promotions as quickly as the others. &quot;Pluto&quot; went for a 1st Lt to major in a page, while with all that Ken is doing he finally gets promoted to Captian.

One of them read the Corp series in ten days. He said they were the best he's ever read, and agreed with me that &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; was his favorite, too.

In this book, we have Ken (Killer) McCoy being sent behind enemy lines in the Phillipines to lend aid and supplies to a guerrilla army led by General Fertig. It is an incredibly dangerous mission, and we need to wait until the very end of the book to see whether or not Ken McCoy can get out. The time is sent around the end of the year in 1942, and the beginning of 1943. At that time the War in the Pacific was going full steam, and the Americans were running into some surprising difficulties with the Japanese.

The difficulties involved in planning and supporting such an operation make for a great story. Unfortunately, the writing is horrible. Griffin has the exasperating habit of providing the same &quot;detail&quot; about people and weapons over and over.Characters that have been central figures throughout the entire book are still named by their full name, including middle initial (or NMI for &quot;No Middle Initial&quot;), rank, and service throughout the book. For example, one of the central figures is referred to as &quot;Captain Robert B. Macklin, USMC&quot;, for what seems like the 100th time, when there are only 5 pages left in the book!And who could forget that the proper designation for a Springfield rifle is &quot;U.S Rifle, Caliber .30-06, Model 1903&quot;, or that the standard-issue .45 pistol is a &quot;Model 1911 .45 ACP pistol&quot; after reading these terms 50 times? Does Griffin do this because he thinks we like reading the full designations over and over, or because that's the way a military novel should read, or does he simply have to reach a required word count?I enjoyed the story, but wish there was less unnecessary and repetitive detail and more information about what actually happened in the Philippines during the war."},{"Title":"Behind the Lines","review":"I picked up these books hoping to gain some insight into the actions of the Marine Corps in the Pacific during World War II. What I found instead was a sort of soap opera that rambles on for hundreds of pages without getting around to much actual fighting. For example, The Marines don't even get to Guadalcanal (their first major offensive) until the end of book III, some 1200 pages into the story. Those 1200 intervening pages are mostly conversations (ad nauseam) between stateside Marine Corps officers as they sit around headquarters, or go out on the town chasing skirts.The small portion of the books that is devoted to actual battles is done in such a cursory fashion that you're left with the impression that the author either finds this aspect of the Marines' mission distasteful, or doesn't understand it well enough to write about it. Mr. Griffin could have deleted about 80% of his material, and would have ended up with better books, albeit still not good ones.If you're the sort of person who likes to watch daytime soap operas, then you may enjoy these books. If, on the other hand, you're interested in military history, the banality of these books will leave you screaming in frustration."},{"Title":"Behind the Lines","review":"I have read (and re-read) all of this author's books at least 5 times, and as a retired Naval Chief Petty Officer, I can attest to their realism, gutwrenching tension, authentic battle scenarios, tear-jerking reunions and farewells, and the absolutely captivating parade of truly believable, unforgettable characters that he has brought to life for my enjoyment. I vicariously relive my days of active duty through his books (all three series). &quot;The Brotherhood of War&quot; series was my companion on a long, lonely voyage around South America (a Warrant Officer--the ship's Bosun of USS Independence-- turned me on to it) in 1988. I raided a book store in Virginia Beach, Va prior to the cruise and had the entire set, except for &quot;The Aviator's&quot; which I managed to have sent to me along the way; it caught up to me before the cruise ended. I devour all his books and eagerly await the next. I celebrate his expertise and marvel at the depth of his research and his grasp of the inner workings (and foul-ups) of the military machine. I specially like reading the message traffic that he recreates. It is all absolutely authentic and a joy to consume. I even identify with the &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; series because I was stationed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyards and came to know the city quite well. His attention to detail concerning the layout of the city and his practice of using the actual street names makes me feel as if I am riding along with the officers on their beats. It brings back many fond memories of that beautiful and historic city. I wish this author a long, long life and I selfishly hope for many more from his two remaining series of books.

My wife also enjoys the books so I would say they are suitable for all readers."},{"Title":"Behind the Lines","review":"My introduction to W.E.B. Griffin's fiction was a few volumes from the Brotherhood of War series. I read The Captains,The Majors, and The Colonels from that series before giving up on it. I wanted to read some war novels, and wasn't sure beyond a reasonable doubt until after reading three installments that Griffin wasn't really trying to write war novels. He is more interested in the back room/office politics of military brass--some of which takes place when the country happens to be at war. Those three books, to me, read like novelized versions of a few seasons' dose of Army Wives--albeit with a FAR greater degree of accuracy in military details.Behind the Lines was my introduction to his \\"The Corps\\" series, my favorite of his military novels, and a pretty good read. WWII is still the period of history that fascinates me most, and American guerrilla action in the Philippines is a subject I haven't read much about, so those were points in the book's favor. But I think what made it a winner for me were the characters. I related to Fertig, McCoy and Weston, and wanted them to prevail.My complaints about this book are similar to those I have against other Griffin tomes: office politics are interesting up to a point, but he really emphasizes them at the expense of plot and action. The word-for-word (simulated) top-secret memos did become old after about six of them. Characters who jump from enlisted ranks--or even civilian life--into O-3 to O-5 commissions are extremely over-represented, while officers like Macklin are severely under-represented. There were also some plot devices, meant to up the tension probably, that just didn't strike me as worthwhile (all wrapped up in the aforementioned back-room politics). But there was enough good in this book to outweigh all of that.Griffin may pick details to dwell on that run against my tastes, but his stories are very plausible. His main characters are three-dimensional. Macklin, for instance, probably couldn't have been drawn better. Also, I hadn't experienced Griffin getting into the minds of the opfor before, so it was nice to find that he gave just as much careful attention to depicting characters and office politics on the Japanese side as the American.All-in-all this was a page-turner; and I cared about what was going to happen to the characters, from beginning to end.Henry Brown is the author of TEOTWAWKI aviation adventure The Delayed Blitz(Krieg), as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone.

The first-hand tales of Henson's Arctic exploits are told in straightforward prose, full of personal touches. One can almost see the twinkle in Henson's eye as he related these stories to listeners to whom the Arctic was as remote as the moon.Henson was a key player on one Peary expedition after another from 1892 through 1909. He went with Peary virtually every step of the way on every expedition after Peary's first crossing of Greenland. Henson built sledges and other equipment, handled the dog teams, took his turn out in front by a day or more breaking trail, and, most importantly, developed a close working relationship with the Eskimos, whose assistance was the key to reaching the North Pole. Henson is not shy about his own contribution, and that view is supported by the three introductions to Dark Companion by Peary contemporaries MacMillan, Freuchen and Stefansson. These testimonials alone are reason enough to buy this book. MacMillan, a tenderfoot on the 1909 Peary expedition to the Pole and an Arctic explorer in his own right in later years, readily admitted that Peary took Henson to the pole because, with all of his experience and abilities he was the best man for the job. And Henson's courage -- whether pushing ahead with Peary despite lack of supplies, relying on hunting skills to avoid almost certain starvation, or facing constant danger from moving, crushing, and suddenly parting ice, or fighting walruses from kayaks -- is indisputable.These Arctic accounts are available in other sources, including Henson's own book, a Negro Explorer at the North Pole, and books by Henson's fellow travelers, Peary, Bartlett, MacMillan and Borup. But only in Dark Companion can one read Henson's account of survival in another inhospitable environment -- late 19th and early 20th century America.The Arctic was a place where Henson could contribute his full potential. Not because Peary or his white companions were civil rights crusaders, but because the environment of the north simply demanded too much to afford the luxury of limiting any person's contributions on arbitrary racial grounds. By contrast, Henson's life outside the Arctic was a struggle against diminished expectations and unspoken slurs at best and outright racial hatred at worst. But in telling the story, Henson focuses on the exception, the kindness of the sea captain who tutored him and taught him to read, as the defining influence in his life.Upon returning to America after Peary's expedition to the pole, Henson's contribution went largely unrecognized. In fact, critics openly attacked Peary for taking a Negro on the final leg of the North Pole dash. Early on, the argument, by Cook supporters, was raised that Peary must have taken Henson because he didn't want a \\"credible\\" witness. This, the argument goes, would leave Peary free to make phony claims, since Henson would presumably be either too stupid to contradict Peary, would not dare to contradict him, or would be ignored.Henson continues to be caught in the crossfire of modern Peary critics. To discount the possibility that Peary might have chosen Henson on merit, critics routinely have referred to him as Peary's manservant or valet. Yet Peary listed Henson as an assistant. Henson was only a \\"valet\\" once, when surveying in Nicaragua prior to 1892. Some recent critics disparage Henson's lack of \\"full literacy\\" and analyze his every statement looking for inconsistencies to prove him a \\"liar.\\" Henson's recounting of his adventures to Robinson, some 40 to 50 years after the fact, does, to be sure, contain some inconsistencies in the details. Still, one wonders why some critics readily excuse what might charitably be called far greater memory lapses in the accounts of Frederick Cook, a \\"white man,\\" while branding Henson's mistaken recollections as lies. But Henson never wavered on the essentials: Henson, with all his expert sledding experience, was confident that the expedition had covered the necessary distance from the last navigational observation to the Pole.One cannot find fault with Robinson's editorial decision to let Henson's recollections speak for him. The opportunity to get Henson's detailed story, under oath, subject to cross examination, while it was fresh in his mind, was passed up when Congress, in its investigation of Peary's claim, did not bother to call Henson as a witness. History will never recover from that shameful oversight, and Robinson could not repair the damage.This book is not about whether Henson actually stood at the pole, or only 5 or 20 miles from it. It is about one man's decision to be shaped by what was positive in his life. It is about having the courage to face every conceivable danger to participate in a great enterprise on an even playing field. It is about the satisfaction of seeing one's talents and experience put to good use, and of being the one called upon when the need was greatest -- in short, a hero. It is an inspirational story."},{"Title":"Dark companion: The story of Matthew Henson (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"Hi.My name is Aviaq Henson from Greenland.I believe that Matthew Henson had wrote that book because all he said was true, why would a black man lie to write that book while there was still much of racism in societies.

It reads really well. Mr. Robinson assembled the memoirs with great craft and thought without leaving you feeling that the writer was in the way.Instead, he wrote a compelling story of an amazing feat that brings the reader right inside the story. Honestly, there were so many instances when the descriptions were so perfectly written that I felt that I was there.From Matt's running away as a child to his tutelage on the sea on to Central America and Greenland.Matt's early days with the natives of Greenland. Their acceptance of him as a lost brother (ancestral memory of the African Diaspora?.. who knows?) His learning their ways. The bear hunt was incredibly invigorating to read.There are so many chapters that boggle the mind. The chapter where Peary's toes get frostbitten, and how Matt saves him. This was November in the Arctic. Pitch black; unimaginable cold. The hardship was palpable. And when Matt broke through the ice, I had no idea how he could've survived.An extremely compelling read.

Morrow Author"},{"Title":"Dark companion: The story of Matthew Henson (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"This book, first published in 1947, was the first biography of Matthew Henson, the long time associate of the arctic explorer Robert E. Peary, who claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. According to the publisher, the author worked \\"in close collaboration with Henson\\" to tell his story, and the story he tells is the stuff of legends-literally. Much of the circumstantial substance of the book is simply at odds with all existing documentary evidence.On its way to building up Henson's role in Peary's expeditions to an unwarranted degree and at others' expense, including Peary himself, ultimately insinuating that Henson should be credited as the discoverer of the North Pole, Robinson leaves a trail of howlers along the way. In his account of Peary's 1891-92 expedition, Henson builds Peary's winter headquarters nearly single-handedly, when it was really a largely prefabricated building designed to be thrown up in a few days. We learn that expedition member Eivind Astrup, who was barely 5'9\\" and weighed 170 pounds, was a \\"broad shouldered giant\\"; poor Langdon Gibson, divided into two different people as \\"Gibson \\" and \\"Langdon,\\" goes off in different directions in search of his lost companion, John Verhoeff. When it is done, Robinson has the expedition returning to New York instead of Philadelphia, as it truly did. These amazingly elementary gaffs show that Robinson didn't even bother to read Peary's published record of the expedition, Northward, Over the \\"Great Ice,\\" but rather relied on the aging Henson's faulty memory of events already 50 years in the past.Robinson's account of Peary's 1898-1902 expedition is hardly better. He has a circumstantial account of a meeting between Peary and his rival, Otto Sverdrup, aboard Peary's ship, which, in common with many other circumstantial accounts in the book, was an event that never happened. He even allows Henson to claim credit for saving Peary's life when Peary froze his toes on a journey to Fort Conger in 1899. Actually, Peary's surgeon was with Peary on this journey and attended to his injuries, but Henson claims the surgeon never left the ship.Dark Companion also contains \\"facts\\" that would be a surprise to the scientific literate. For instance, Henson's observation that \\"in the Arctic, the sun at its peak of ascension is rarely more than 10 degrees above the horizon,\\" or that \\"longitude cannot be determined above the 80th parallel.\\" He also learn that Henson lost 60 pounds on his journey to the Pole and back. Considering Henson only weighed about 130 pounds, that is a pretty amazing statement in itself.Even events of a personal nature that could only have come from Henson don't ring true. Although Robinson states that when Henson met Lucy Ross in 1905 \\"he was in love for the first time in his life,\\" according to Henson's leading advocate, S. Allen Counter, Henson had in fact been married previously to Eva Flint in 1891 and divorced by her in 1897. And Henson gives Robinson an account of his childhood that is circumstantially incompatible with the account he had given in his own 1912 autobiography A Negro Explorer at the North Pole. In Dark Companion Robinson quotes the kindly old sea captain who took Henson from the wharves of Baltimore to be his cabin boy as saying to him: \\"Promise me you'll [never lie]. Lying is a bad thing.\\" Evidently, Henson didn't take the Captain's advice. He told conflicting tales about his himself at every turn, and the older he grew the taller they got.As for the writing style, this book might easily be mistaken as one for pre-adolescents rather than aimed at an adult audience. (The New York Times Book Review compared its style to that of the Rover Boys juvenile novels of the 1900s). But for any level of audience, any author who presents his work as biography has a moral obligation to stick to documentary truth. But this book is full of fantasy. Even S. Allen Counter, who once accepted this book as truth, now calls it a \\"biographical novel.\\" One can easily sympathize with the neglect of Henson's real accomplishments in exploration and his real contributions to Peary's expeditions in the past as a result of racism. However, righting the wrongs of the past cannot justify writing fiction and presenting it as history.Fiction, too, is Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole with Henson and four Inuit sledge drivers. Instead, all the evidence (or lack of it) contained in Peary's voluminous papers points to it having been the greatest scientific hoax of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Dark companion: The story of Matthew Henson (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"Why doesn't someone write an adult book about Matt Henson?

It touched me so deep that I still remember the sound recording of the auther's voice. Now I want to refer it to my kids."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"This was quite an amazing story. I hadn't known that Jean Fritz was born in China and lived there until she was twelve years old. As the Communist government took over, Jean and her family had some harrowing times! No attempt was made by Fritz to gloss over or romanticize her life in China. I found the book extremely engrossing."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Homesick is a great, interesting story that summarizes her childhood life. Jean Fritz uses wonderful, descriptive words about how she felt during her life in China. This book kept me hooked all the way through and I would defiantly recommend it to all age groups."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Jean Fritz when I was 8 years old, when she spoke at an awards program for a youth writing competition, and having my copy of Homesick autographed. I very much enjoyed this book as a child, and just recently re-read it as an adult and found it every bit as entertaining and charming. Although it's categorized as youth reading, and written from the point of view of young Jean, I'm certain many adults would find it a good read as well. She tells her story with humor and longing, and paints a vivid picture of China in the 1920s, and of the culture clash between China and America, both while she's living in China and after she comes to the U.S. I highly recommend this book for any age. A perfect story for parents to read with their children, that will entertain both."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"As a child, I liked Fritz's books,so I was thrilled to discover her autobiography. Unfortunately, this work is depressing and dull. The character \\"Jean\\" came across as spoiled, whiny, and rude to her parents. As a child, I might have found her type of behavior brave and daring. As an adult, it was irritating. I'm not sure who the audience is intended to be: the book isn't written well enough for adults, and it is too somber for childen. The depiction of China is interesting though, with its unromanticized view of the Chinese."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Jean Fritz was born an American girl in China. Growing up she wanted to know about her American life. Throughout her earlier years she can only see her American life in letters from her grandma (lives in america). Finally, after waiting many years her family decides to go back. When she gets to America she questions whether or not she will fit in, after living on the opposite side of the world.During the coarse of the book, I liked the story's reality to everyday issues. They are the same no matter where you live. Whether it being teased and not wanting to go to school or begging mother for that special something for christmas. There are so many cultures and different beliefs, that when it comes to basic standards of living it is all the same.I did not dislike anything in Homesick. Although, I did learn about the separation of Chinese and Americans. Not in a bad way. The Americans had a small park blocked off to Chinese in order to have a place in comparison to America. Therefore, by finishing the book I give it a thumbs up and can relate to being homesick."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Imagine being the only American student in a British school. Then imagine being homesick for a country you never lived in.In this graceful blend of autobiography and fiction, Jean Fritz provides readers with insight into the maturation of--not only a girl--but also a patriot. Her steadfast private dream is to live in the land of the free. Set in China during the 1920'swhile the Communist Revolution is gathering momentum, HOMESICK shares a girl's observations on the upheaval of the only Society she has ever known. She endures the zealous violence which is especially directed towards all \\"foreign devils,\\" as well assuffering the private heartaches of her own family life.Jean's father works for the Y: the Fritzs' only motivation is to improve the lot of the Chinese people, but national events dramatically disrupt most lives. Resentful at being stuck on the wrong side of the globe, Jean yearns for her relatives in Pennsylvania, for she has been denied a Yankee childhood. Nor is she indifferent to the plight of her neighbors; in particular she loves and feels great compassion for her faithful Chinese nanny, Lin Nai-Nai. The brutality of war is related through a young girl's eyes, while her imagination is trapped bewteen two worlds. Will she become so ensnared in the insidious trap of Revolution that she has to reliquish her dream of living as a true American? If she does escape, will she ever return to thatland of wise-eyed junks?"},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"THE BOOK Homesick:My Own Story is about a REAL author telling of the times when she lived in China and her thoughts and feelings. Now Jean Fritz is a well known author- not a girl homesick for a home she had never been in.What really got me interested in her book was her.She came to my school when I was studying China (2nd grade).I have always been a reader(I read the 4th Harry Potter book in less then 12 hrs!), even in 2nd grade, but at the time, I wasn't interested in thosew types of history and culture books.I recently joined a book club and they choose the book.Now I'm glad I read it.....it is one of the best historical books I have ever read! (my friend is going 2 CHINA!)"},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Homesick My Own Story is an exellent book. Jean Fritz did a good job"},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Homesick: My Own Story by Jean Fritz is a story about an American girl who grows up in China. She spends a good part of her life wishing she could be in America, where she belongs. WHen she's not doing that, she'scorresponding with her grandmother,trying to make friends with some young chinese children,and learning british culture in school.As you can see, Jean Fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up. However, this story is an autobiography, and is in almost no way fictional. Jean Fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway, though. Jean Fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane ticket. Her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot, or even understand the full story. The autobiography is punctuated by emotions. All in all, this is a fine educational history text, but is not, in my opinion, a fitting storybook."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"A really remarkable book. Jean Fritz is author of many an exciting children's biography. If you've read \\"Why Don't You Get a Horse, Sam Adams?\\" or \\"Can't You Make Them Behave, King George?\\" then you know her works already. Turning her talents towards a slightly more recent history, Fritz takes a good long look at her own life. Having grown up in China in the early 1920s, this is a story of a child trying to discover where she fits in.First of all, you have to admire Fritz's candor. The very first thing she does is state in the Forward that she considers this a fiction. Though the facts are true here and there, the author has taken some liberties with time and memory. She obviously cannot remember everything that happened perfectly, so she has filled in the gaps as best as possible. Though, she points out, \\"it does not feel like fiction to me. It is my story, told as truly as I can tell it\\". THANK YOU, Jean Fritz. How many books do we read where the author claims that everything within the book is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, while taking wild leaps in narrative and interpretation? Finally, we have an author that admits that much of this book may be considered fiction, though she herself remembers it as fact. Such honesty is admirable, and exceedingly rare in non-fiction writers.As for the story itself, Fritz is very good at what she does. The writing here is superb. Living in a very sketchy time in China's history, little Jean was in the unfortunate position of living in a country where foreigners were finally not being tolerated with much kindness any longer. Often times Chinese peasants rail against Jean for being the kind of \\"foreign devil\\" that is a bane to their country. Fritz never condemns these people, and even makes note at the back of this book the reasons behind their dislike and distrust. China was a country that was continually being divided into smaller and smaller pieces by the invading colonists. Neither does the character of Jean ever forget that the servants who work for her are human beings as well. Her parents often do fall into the master-servant manner of thinking, a fact that Jean objects to. They do not learn much about the world in which they live. They instead attempt to recreate their own American lives in a foreign land. But Jean knows that there are aspects of Chinese life that she vastly prefers to the life of her parents. The fact that she recognizes this is impressive. The fact that she can relay it years after the fact in this book, is astounding.If I have any objections to this book at all they are directed not at the author, but at the illustrator. Margot Tomes has her points. She is not necessarily a bad illustrator. But in this particular book her pictures are superfluous and unnecessary. Sometimes they even touch upon the offensive without really going there. While Fritz never condemns the native Chinese for their opinions, Tomes draws them looking sneaky or sordid at inappropriate times. One such example is in a scene where Jean's servants feed her cat outside, not knowing she's around. The scene in the book is rather touching. Until this time, Jean was half afraid her cook was trying to poison the family. Knowing him to be a person capable of caring for her cat (as he says, \\"A cat is a cat. There are no foreign cats, no Chinese cats, no capitalist cats, no Communist cats. Just cats\\") she no longer fears his food. Yet the picture accompanying this text shows a shifty eyed servant peering suspiciously over his shoulder as the cats eats. Unnecessary. Somewhat offensive.Fritz ends this book with a series of photographs displaying her family, friends, and where she lived in China. Combined with the book, these serve as an excellent document about a time little recorded in either adult or children's fiction. Using a unique perspective culled from her own life, Jean Fritz has written one of the most interesting books about the Chinese/American experience existing today. It is an honorable and impressive piece of work."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Homesick: My Own Story is one of those rare books that feel entirely true. So many times an author's memoir is written &quot;for&quot; a specific audience, so that it takes on the tone of what the readers expect or are hooked by more than by what's true, but Jean Fritz's account of her childhood in China feels absolutely accurate, as if she is writing down the girl she once was. I found the novel an interesting read when I first read it, and when I read it again upon moving to Shanghai, I found it familiar. Even though so many years have passed, many things are the same, here and all over the world. A different sort of story for the un-narrow-minded, Homesick is the kind of discovery that we should all make about ourselves."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"I read this book this year, when my mom sent me a box of books to camp over the summer. All the rest were Dear Americas so this was the first one I picked up. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I read during softball and got hit on the head. I read during dinner and stained my favortie shirt. I tried to read dujring instructional swim but my counselor took the book away from me. I read under the covers and I got into trouble when my division head came in. I finished it in under eight hours. It's the best non-Dear America book I've ever read. It tells a very interesting story, full of humor and wit. Jean Fritz is an incredibly talented writer, who managed to cover two years time in an average-sized book. Each chapter is a story all its own and also funny. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a really good historical fiction/nonfiction story."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"I gave this book four stars because I didn't like the sad parts.

I am a fan of Jean Fritz books in general."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"&quot; Homesick: My Own Story&quot; was a real eye-opener for me. I first read it when I was in seventh grade and I still remember what it was like: Looking through Jean's eyes I saw China in a rough time; I learned where the Yangtse River was and about the junks that floated upon it; and how people would get rides in rickshaws pulled by men eager for the money.I broiled through all of her worries and troubles, grinned in happy times, and cried when everything seemed hopeless.I liken this book to &quot;Number the Stars&quot; by Lois Lowry. &quot;Homesick...&quot; did not have as much action the way through as that story, but it certainly holds the same endearing qualities as &quot;Number the Stars&quot;.This book read very fluently and I came to know much about something I had never been told about. I recommend &quot;Homesick: My Own Story&quot; to anyone interested in different cultures and a personable young lady who would rather have the name Marjorie instead of Jean"},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"We loved this book because we were able to do an author study on Jean Fritz. We have read many of her books. The fifth grade curriculum requires us to study American History. Reading books by Jean Fritz has allowed my students and I to approach history with an open mind.

Learning through literature is very effective and we have grasped many historical concepts by reading these books."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this book, but once I started reading I didn't want to put it down. This book tells the true story of a young American girl who grew up in China in the 1920's. I knew very little about China and its history, so this book was very educational and insightful for me.This book stirred up a lot of emotions in me. I felt myself totally caught up in the life of the young Jean Fritz and sharing her hopes and dreams, her frustrations and her sorrows. It is a story that has very humorous moments, moments full of excitement and suspense, heartwarming and tender moments, and moments that are simply heart-wrenching.If this book were simply a story that somebody made up then it probably would have meant very little to me, but knowing that this was a true story full of real experiences really opened my eyes and made me feel like I was glimpsing a tiny bit of a history I had previously known nothing about. Thank you to Jean Fritz for sharing this part of her life with us."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Homesick by Jean Fritz is an amazing autobiography about the ups and downs of life. Even though it was sort of depressing at times, it had a positive ending. In this incredible story, Jean endured living in China, traveling on the President Taft ship to America, and having a disappointing teacher. Jean Fritz described her youth in outstanding detail and readers will enjoy the roller coaster of good and and bad events. One important event was when she finally arrived in America and got to meet her grandmother. Homesick is appropriate for ages 4th- middle school. It is an especially good read for students who enjoy learning about history and the life of people in the past. The moral of the story is the grass may always seem greener, no matter how much things change. P.S. Caroline is awesome! (aka totally cuckoo!)Homesick by Jean Fritz is a heartwarming story about a young American girl who grows up in China. This story has many ups and downs. For example, an exciting change was when Jean moved to America and met her grandmother for the first time. She had been writing letters and had talked on the phone, but had never met her. A sad moment was Jean's baby sister, Miriam, died. One thing that we thought could be improved upon was the ending. We didn't like that it stopped at an awkward moment and left you hanging. This book truly played with our emotions. It included some humor and history about China. We would recommend this book to 4th-8th graders and people who like history and adventure. This book really walks you through major events in Jean's childhood."},{"Title":"Homesick (Novel)","review":"Jean writes her life story true but not boring.

In away i can relate to her because of the things that went on in her family but in the long run there's always a reason for things that happen. Just like the saying things happen for a reason. Even though Jane's life was much harder then mine we all go through struggles with differnt types of things.

I thought I'd write some reviews on the many books i do own. As I clicked on this book (my favorite) I actually did a double take at Ms Gallanti's review written in 2003, thinking i ALREADY wrote it.

In fact when I moved to the USA from England with only my backpack this book was with me. Why? It contains the most profound psychologically and spiritually insightful astrology that you can get your hands on. In fact, this book is almost a shame to read, because once you have read it, you will be hard pushed to find a better astrological text...Arroyo here talks about the chart and particularly about the aspects and transits of Saturn and the outer planets, not with a cookbook approach but with the insight of the very special humanistic alchemy that carachterizes Arroyo's work. Drawing for Jungian concepts, psychology and spirituality Arroyo brings to life the birth chart and its players and weaves meaning into the life experience. And his writing is so beautiful, profound and yet simple, deep but easy to grasp. I love this man, such a jewel of mind and wisdom for us to enjoy...In the book you will also find lots of stuff about the ascendant, transits, progressions, little bits and pieces of information that, even years after , you will refer to and think about and mull over in your mind. This is one of those books with that magical holographic quality, where every time you read it, it expands and you see stuff you had not seen before...If I had to reccommend one book for you not to miss, this would be the one. Buy it. You will treasure it for life!"},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"The more I read about astrology the more beautiful and complex it is. There is so much to be assimilated and interpreted: houses, planets, signs, aspects, elements, etc. Stephen Arroyo has taken the subject of karma and really explained how the energies of the planets can affect or reveal how karma is expressed. He's done this in a way that is easy to understand, and breathtaking to read. He gets right to the heart of the matter, with examples to clarify the concepts. The book added to my understanding of transits and progressions. Arroyo's discussion of Edgar Cayce's readings on astrology were illuminating. I loved his discussion of the application of astrology to counseling, and how a deep understanding of astrology helps one to be a better counselor. He also includes a bibliography of books he quoted from in the text, that can only serve as a beacon for more knowledge of astrology. After reading this book I am hungry for more! The insights in this book will make it useful for years to come."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"This was the first book in astrology I ever bought, amazing seeming it was over 20 years ago just after it was first published. This book has an energy about it, as obviously from the previous reviews, Stephen Arroyo has IT, he is the consummate humanistic astrologer who can give people the absolute astrological stuff that we need when we need it. Very much in the same area of astrology as Liz Green, yet in my opinion much more easily accessible, for as much as I adore Liz Greene's work, it can be quite intense and needs many readings to take in what she is saying. All of Stephen Arroyo's books are a joy to read, this one being my favourite. If you love astrology you need to do yourself a favour and buy this book."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"Many of the other reviewers have said this already, but I must repeat it once more - this is an exceptional book, giving readers a deep insight into what astrology really 'means'. It is not a cook book of how to interpret charts. Instead, Arroyo presented to his readers, the purpose behind astrology and that it is not a static method of foreseeing the future. We are here to learn lessons and our birthchart tells us what our lessons are, what type of energy we possess in the first place, and how, by facing up to the challenges presented to us in life, spiritual growth will ensue. Arroyo describes the birthchart as a 'tool' to guide us through our life. By understanding our basic make up, we can learn to make the most out of our positive points and try to improve on our weakers ones. Many of my astro-skeptic friends are so impressed by this refreshing view that they are seeing astrology in a different light. The book is written in a very easy to understand manner, though an initial understanding of chart interpretation is needed."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"This book takes a positive, helpful view of the topic of karma as it can be understood through astrology. There is a particular focus on the outer planets, including a description of their aspects and transits. In each section, Arroyo moves from the general concepts to a more specific cook-book listing of the planets. He discusses karmic relationships through analyzing synastry and progressions, and includes a special chapter on the Ascendant and Midheaven axes. Arroyo refers to Edgar Cayce's view of reincarnation and planetary influences on a particular incarnation. This book provides an exceptionally accessible viewpoint, in the sense that it approaches karma as patterns to be recognized through the astrological counseling process, rather than encouraging specious speculation about specific past lives. A book recommended for astrologers who seek to include an evolutionary spiritual element in their style of interpretation without sounding like Madame Lazonga."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"I have owned this book for over 15 years and it is as relevant now as it was then. Arroyo has written a masterpiece, jammed packed with so much information grap your highlighter and expect to learn, regardless of your level.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"This is a profound book, and simply the best astrology book I have ever read. It's long &amp; detailed, but not dense. Arroyo's philosophical &amp; humanistic bent is wonderful.

It's one of the books I'd take to a desert island!"},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"Different from his other books, his writing style here is rather thick. But, since he is really insightful in terms of interpretation of any astrological phenomenon, I could easily read through this book. (I'm not a native speaker in English.) Especially if you are going through some difficult transition period (for example, trans-saturnian planets are making tight aspects to your natal personal planets), this is surely must-read. I would think that he reveals all he wants to say about astrological interpretation. Other his books is not so insightful as this- they are rather intentionally written for novices."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"I have owned a copy of this book for over 10 years and it has continued to provide me with astrological wisdom and insights that no other book can match. The depth of Stephen Arroyo's writing here is extraordinary, with perhaps the only criticism being that so much is packed in to one single book. But this is hardly a complaint!The outer planets are covered extensively with many examples of aspects and transits to the birth charts of people with relatively \\"ordinary\\" lives. This makes a refreshing change from much astrological literature that deals only with famous people, or people with severe problems of one kind or another. The chapter on Saturn is excellent, particularly the journey of Saturn through the twelve houses. Show any 29-year old (with a bit of self-awareness!) the section featuring the Saturn return, and watch their reaction as they read!This book is not only full of essential contemporary astrology; Arroyo also draws on his considerable experience of other tools for spiritual and psychological growth. He has a background in marriage and family counselling (chapter on \\"Karma and relationships\\"), and his many references to various spiritual teachers, eastern religions, western psychology and the Edgar Cayce psychic readings add to the spiritual power of Arroyo's writing. A modern classic."},{"Title":"Astrology, Karma & Transformation: The Inner Dimensions of the Birth Chart","review":"I've had this book since the first edition came out in the mid-70's. It is not for the beginner, but if you have some basic knowledge of astrology and want more in-depth information from a psychological perspective, this is the book for you. The author has extensive sections on the outer planets and information on transits and progressions. There are some sections with a \\"cookbook\\" approach, but this is much more than a cookbook-style tome.I would describe this book as concept rich. There is so much material here, you could take years digesting it, but it is so well written that you will be taking away new knowledge after reading just a few pages.I am just writing this review now because I have purchased the Kindle edition as well. I still use this book in my astrology work and love the idea of being able to carry all my reference books with me."},{"Title":"Propertius in Love: The Elegies (A Joan Palevsky book in classical literature)","review":"Length:: 6:43 MinsPropertius was perhaps the first poet of Romantic love, as we know it today. This particular poem, in its unconcern with the mundane, it's bold - still strikingly Roman - conclusion of the lover's triumph even over death, is illustrative of the main concerns of Propertius in this faithfully translated volume of his poetry."},{"Title":"Shatter Me with Dawn: A Celebration of Country Life","review":"This is a fine collection of moving and often funny essays growing out of the author's trials and triumphs on a farm in the hills east of Atlanta, Georgia. More than the usual &quot;back to the earth&quot; escapade, author Russell created a working, livable farm out of some lovely wooded acreage and an old farmhouse that she had moved onto the property. The story of that move, with its encounters with narrow bridges, tree limbs, and school children dismissed from class to watch the spectacle, is typical of the book's essays: a wonderful eye for detail, and a humorous but respectful feel for the people who inhabited this adventure. Best moments include her discovery of the differences between cows and horses--a fall-down funny episode--and her depictions of the creatures (including people, of course) and the natural scene of her beloved corner of rural Georgia. It is no &quot;stretch&quot; to compare her writing with that of Thoreau."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"So, I finished my first book in the original DragonLance saga, and I had this one ready to go; and go it went - into a pile of books to trade for better books. What in the frig is going on in the first 50 pages? It was like reading a chapter in the life of someone, and then for no reason other than to jump ahead, find that person years later doing something else just as mundane just to find out what happened those past whatever years. I was interested in the beginning, I truly was. I tried, dear Lord did I try, but I could not make my way through the rubbish that this book had within its cover. I did everything that I could to get through this book. I re-read pages to make sure that I didn't miss something, I would stop and go back and make sure that I did not miss a connection. This seems like a life-less, sense-less, and point-less novel, that is anything but entertaining. The Weis/Hickman bug has not bitten me yet. I say Pass on this. Dragon's of Autumn Twilight, sure, but not this one."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"Good ideas, good settings, but the best thing about the novels was the characters, who were interesting and fairly well developed. However, the writing was shallow and talentless, and the story lacked energy."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"I absolutley loved this book!However, I have a major beef with the trilogy.3/4 of this trilogy is great, however all of the books were completely ruined when the tanks and armed soldiers showed up.I hate it when fantasy writers try to merge the modern world with a fantasy world. I see it as the worst cop out, perhaps even worse than the \\"it was only a dream\\" ending.If they could have just changed this one thing, this would have been so much better."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"Upon talking to some other people who read fantasy, I found out that their general view on Weis and Hickman is usually one of apathy, or worse yet, contempt. Most of these people prefer books like the Wheel of Time series, which is fine, even though I think that that particular series has become nauseatingly boring. I've been reading Weis/Hickman books for a long time now, and while they certainly arent the best of the lot, they're a lot better than most: I certainly like them more than Jordan.This particular book is probably among the best they've written. A strange, thoughtful tale, the book is a reasonably gripping read, that traverses vast periods of time within a few pages. (17 years to be exact: compare that to Jordan's crawling behemoth, that moves a few days in the space of a thousand pages.) The action itself takes place in a much shorter period of time though, which is just as well I suppose.I wont bother with detailing the plot, except to say that it's above average and well-detailed. The book has a tangible sense of sadness to it, a wistfulness that is lacking in most fantasies. The characters are well portrayed: Joram is convincing as the unloved, bitter young man, Simkin is one of the more amusing characters in fantasy, and Bishop Vanya's amoral approach to manipulation hits close to home. But the real triumph of the book (and indeed the series) is Saryon. In my opinion, he is simply one of the best characters to have ever appeared in a fantasy. So much of fantasy is carried on the shoulders of testosterone-laden heroes, 'great' warriors who never make mistakes and rarely regret their actions. Even if they do show some semblance of sorrow and regret, it's as convincing as a fish putting on a bicycle show. Saryon is a bitter, twisted, tortured man, who, above all else, is a simple, gentle soul caught up in a world that has started to go very wrong for him. The loss of his faith, his yielding to temptation, and his spiral into darkness caused by the burdens that he bears are immaculately described, and are very believable. He is a metaphor for a darkness within all our souls, a darkness different from greed and evil, but one just as devastating: the terrible malady of weakness. I have to take my hat off to the authors: they really created something special with Saryon.Unfortunately, things go downhill from here. The second book is almost as good, but the third is almost overwhelmingly dissapointing. I'll leave you to find out what happens of course, (if you ever get that far), but suffice it to say that I nearly threw down my copy about a 100 pages into it.In short: horrible third book aside, this is an unfairly underlooked series. Pick it up, if you have the chance."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"The world of Merilon is one where magic is life -- individuals are born into their station and rank in life according to their magical abilites. However, more and more, Dead babies (babies lacking magic) are being born to the nobility. They are left to the Deathwatch, to leave this world they were not supposed to be born into; yet, Dead babies are hidden by grieving parents, or smuggled away, and are raised in the world ...This is the story of the intelligent but tormented Catalyst Saryon, the outcast Dead murderer Joram, the lovable trickster Simkin, the bumpkin Mosiah, and the greedy and deceptive Bishop Vanya. Sent away because of an infraction against the Church seventeen years prior, the Catalyst Saryon must locate and turn in the murderer Joram. This quest takes him from a small farming village, to the dread Camp of the Technologists, science being the forbidden Ninth Mystery of the world. Drawn instantly to Joram, Saryon and he create the Darksword, a weapon with the power to drain an individual of all magic, with which one can rule the world.Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, authors of novels in the popular Dragonlance saga, have written another excellent mind-consuming novel. I have read this work many times, and never tire of it's page-turning suspense! This is the first of four Darksword books. Originally written as a trilogy, a fourth book was brought out because so many people wanted to know \\"what happened next.\\"\\"What they do not understand, they fear. What they fear, they destroy.\\""},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"This book have the same ingredients of the Death Gate Cycle: very deep characters, very real social system, and a complex set of secrets to keep you attached to the pages. The scene when Joram is taken by her mother to meet his father in the border, brougth tears to my eyes.Saryon, Joram and specially Simkin are great. And the best of all: the existance of magic. For us, magic lovers, that is a world we like to live in.Just read it."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"It was only by a fluke that I even picked up the Darksword trilogy, but I must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. It took a lot of effort to get through the first book, but by the time I finished it, I found myself completely engrossed in the story and insatiably curious about the other two books. This is a world that I love, and characters I can relate to!"},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"This was hands down, the best trilogy I have ever read. The first book is somewhat slow but stick with it. Once you've finished your friends will have to erect a barracade around you to keep you from charging out and buying the 2nd and 3rd. It is good to see that fantasy worlds the like of Thimhallan are not dead. I am currently reading the Death Gate Cycle by these talented authors and I have to say that I love it. These two writers have the ability to create intricate and fantastic worlds, that draw you in and won't let go. If you ready to experience new worlds than go out and buy these books. But be warned reading this book makes it very difficult to do the less important things like shower eat and sleep!!! :"},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"I was looking at the ages this is recommended for 9-12? What?! This is one of the most serious Fantasy series I have ever read. Weis and Hickman have created a VERY rich and complex world that I personally feel would be above most adults nevermind children. I am not saying they couldn't get anything out of the story, but this is not your average children's tale, let me tell you. I love this book, the world of magic is like a dream that slowly decends into nightmare, but you remember the dream, and you almost want it to continue on, even at the expense of the characters. I am not sure if Simkin is introduced in this book, I haven't read them in a while, but if you read the series only for him, you will not go away disappointed. To this day I quote him and he always brings a smile to my face. I actually don't like the later books as much because too much &quot;reality&quot; ends up destroying the &quot;dream.&quot; It's very sad the end, but worth getting to."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"My Mom Bought the first two books for Easter. I love to read and I ate this story line up. Love the idea of technology and magic, and also it shows a bit of racissim. BY that those with magic originally lived with those that have tech and were prosecuted by them. But those with magic left and have there own world then they prosecuted those born with out magic. Read these novels will give you an idea about courage and some reality that everyone is equal."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"If you want a lot of interesting, evolving plot, this book has it. It's an early trilogy by Weis and Hickman and it shows. It's a fantasy meets sci-fi piece that is just right for the early 80's *LOL*. I throughly enjoyed this series. I read it once in High School and now that I'm in Graduate school, I re-read it. Great trilogy. It's a classic tragic hero story that you can't put down."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"The time was 11:00 p.m. I was just delving into page one of the Darksword Trilogy I: Forging the Darksword. From then on til 4:00 a.m. the time just flew by, not something that happens often but I simply could not make myself stop reading.It was quite happer's chance that I even took the book home. Judging by the looks of it and its title I was expecting something mediocre, if not downright cheesy. Funny, I didn't even notice that the description said \\"...born withOUT magic...\\" I was thinking, \\"born with magic\\" what's the big deal in that? Thankfully I was in a hurry to leave the library so I was in a mind to grab anything that looked semi-bit-interesting.It didn't take long to get into the book. It all began with a crying baby, very much alive yet even his mother, the Empress, weeps tears of crystal for her dead son.We are introduced to the catalyst Saryon, born to serve and uncomfortable with himself, wanting nothing more than to possess the \\"mysteries\\" of the more powerful wizards. In a world where \\"love\\" in outlawed, his curiosity will leads him on a journey into a world as alien to him and to us. He will bond with Joram, a tortured young man born without magic, and together they set out to forge the magic absorbing Darksword and forever change the face of the world.The world is vividly realized, painting dream-like images on the expansive canvas of the mind. I can still envision Merilon in all its glory and it creates a wistful mood which I can't properly describe...at least not intellectually *wink*.Most of the characters are well portrayed with interesting and diverse personalities. The jovial Simkin reigns as not only my favorite character here, but perhaps the most amusing character I've ever encountered in literature. He made me laugh out loud on several occasions and there is a great mystery element concerning him. We don't really know who he is, where he comes from, or what his true motives are. His presence leaves a lasting mark on the trilogy, which wouldn't be the same without him.Overall, while it won't compare to the likes of George R. R. Martin in shear literary value; there's plenty here to satisfy and its perhaps one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've ever had. I would recommend it to anyone. I couldn't wait to pick up the second book in the series which proved to be almost equally enjoyable. 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"What can I say??

The world they develop here is one of their better ones, and the plot and characterization are both well-done. Even if you aren't a fan of their work (due to their assocation with TSR books or whatever) this is a should-read book that shows how effective they can be when they're &quot;on.&quot; While it has some elements of a fantasy epic, this book thankfully deviates from the typical mold."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"The book was almost 400 pages long.

What a wonderful character, and a very creative way of presenting him. The owner of the darksword seems rather sullen for most of the book, but that is purposeful, I believe. As he learns his lessons and discovers the true power of the darksword, his character emerges and his mood lightens considerably. I love the peculiar invasion of the \\"iron wars\\" machinery, I always love when someone ties society into a fantasy book.

Im quite thankful for Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman for introducing me to the world of dragonlance.. since then Ive been reading a lot of sci fi books.. especially books written by them and other authors (jordan,goodkind,eddings pratchett,etc).However I was bitterly disappointed with this book.. there seems to be something missing from it that makes it a great book to read.. after a few chapters i just kept reading through it bored and wishing the story gets interesting as i go further but sadly, it doesnt.

This series was much like the rest of the two authors works, captivating and entertaining, but lacking something. It is a definate must read for fantasy folk, but dont expect too much in the way of detail or intrigue. Simpkin is a marveouls character and Joram is admirable as well, but they lack the depth that is so easy to obtain with a fantasy character. The story is decent, but its fast pace and lack of complexity cause it to fall short of being anything for the halls of fame. If you are sick of Robert Jordans constant introductions to new problems and lack of soultions to the ones that are already there then read this series, it is a refreshing excape from complicated storylines. If you enjoy intricate characters and twisting storylines then you may want to rethink spending 7 bucks."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"What can i say, this book and the other two (there are three books), are one of the best (of better, 3) of the best books i've ever read in my life.

I would have liked a more profound narration about technology and why ,although banned, outcasts use it. After all, only the main character has absolutely no magic (aka Life)."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"Behind this book there is a really intriguing idea: to have magic is to have life and to not have magic is to be dead, and to do things without magic, instead using tools, technology, is the most serious crime one can commit. To use any sort of technology is to be using \\"the dark arts\\". Speaking of magic, this book also has a very unique magic system, in which pretty much everyone in society can use magic, but only certain individuals have the ability to recharge your ability to use it. So basically when your tank runs dry you have to rely on someone known as a catalyst to recharge your magical energies. They also regulate the amount of energy they allow a person to have based on the person's class - their status in society. Now, through into the mix that religion, the church, pretty much dominates society, and you have the ingredients of a really interesting story. This story has the potential for some really thought provoking stuff - and that's why I read, to be entertained and be forced to think about things.The problem of this story is the protagonist.On the one hand, we have a man named Saryon, who is part of the church. His quest for knowledge leads him to a forbidden section of the library that contains all the texts on \\"technology\\" (why isn't that area under lock and key??). He's discovered and reprimanded, and he thinks that's the end of it. I would say more but I don't want to ruin any surprises further on. He's a really good character though. He's not the problem. The problem is a character named Joram, who was born without any magical talents. Understand that in this society, children like Joram are considered \\"without life\\" or \\"dead\\". If you are born \\"dead\\" you are suppose to be killed. Joram avoided that tragic end, and while growing up he got pretty good at sleight of hand, and has been able to fool everyone. Unfortunately way too much time was focused on his upbringing, which I found completely absurd. His mother is completely crazy and abusive, and Joram himself keeps to himself and has a dark, brooding quality to him.I feel like this could have been a brilliant book if the authors had chosen to leave Joram out of it. Perhaps he could have been a minor character. Anyway, the book, because of the protagonists and perhaps the editing as well, falls apart 1/3 of the way in, and by half way through I was ready to stop.Kudos on the authors for Dragonlance, parts of The Deathgate Cycle, and their newest nordic inspired book series, but Darksword is not one of their best."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"I wasn't going to write a review on this book since I had a negative experience with it, but after a look at the other negative reviews I felt the need to give an educated opinion on Forging the Darksword. The sequence of events in the beginning of the novel is a bit hard to get into, but I enjoyed the events being presented, so I continued reading. Though I usually don't like books that start when an ending and then go back in time, I continued with this one because it wasn't really the ending, but the middle that the novel started with. Even after the way the novel opened, the plot was interesting. The magic system was explained, and an interesting character was described. I lost a bit of interest when the book changed point of view to the child Joram. His upbringing was of little consequence and lasted far to long for me. My interest was lost completely when fairies were thrown into the equation. Strange babbling Simkin and the outlaw camp plot was extremely boring to me. The evil mage felt flat, he was certainly evil, but when the time came for him to do something bad I was so uninterested that it hardly phased me. I knew that a sword would be created, and that it would be evil. The war that was hinted at a few times did not seem important, and it didn't really seem to involve the characters of the story either, so I see no reason to continue this series. All of the events that occur in this novel are summarized on the jacket, and I feel that nothing special was added by reading it. Another disappointing Weis/Hickman read."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"Believing the unbelievable and suspending disbelief are par for the course with the fantasy genre of books. That witches and goblins, dragons and unicorn or sky and netherworld all appear and disappear in books like The Darksword Trilogy is a given. We, the fans, expect it.The same courtesy cannot be extended to poor character development and even poorer logical outcomes. That is Forging The Darksword's failure.To be clear and upfront, the book is a great read and has all the elements one expects from the sub-genre of books and, more importantly from Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the authors of the unsurpassableDragon Wing (The Death Gate Cycle, Book 1)series.In a land where magic reigns and death is defined as a lack of these powers, the interplay of church and state, magic and technology and good and evil swirls into an unexpected set of events that quickly seem to spin out of control. The bishop connives, the young prince is sent away to die and the sorceress is not the mother many think she is. This is where one finds a catalyst acting beyond his belief or capability, a dark magus who hears and knows everything not only failing to do so, but also not heeding warnings and a good country boy following a bad, strange one. So, what gives? A still readable book that - despite all the action - is really setting the groundwork for its follow-up."},{"Title":"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","review":"I had read Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends and loved them both and that's why when I saw this trilogy, I decided to buy it.

This new book reviews how Dr. Emoto became involved in his research on water and vibrational healing and includes a nice section of color water crystal photos. It discusses radionics, vibration, resonance, and the properties of waves, as well as the role of consciousness and the environment in informing water, the medium that makes up 70% of the human body. Emoto has noted the correspondences between body organs and emotions, showing how specific emotions generate vibrational disturbances in specific regions of the vibratory continuum that generates the physical body. Emoto's use of written words to create healing vibrations/information in water seems to be a useful means of anchoring intention. This book is more relevant for healing practitioners than Emoto's previous works, while it's also well-suited for laypersons. We can all benefit from Dr. Emoto's insights into how and why well-structured water is vital to life and vibrational harmony - and how we can use our own positive intent to transform water."},{"Title":"The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves","review":"I recommend that you read The Hidden Messages in Water before this book.I have been interested in learning more about Dr. Emoto's work in water crystal photography since I first saw some of these images at Jack Canfield's Breakthrough to Success seminar in August. My first step was to register at the library to borrow a copy of The Hidden Messages in Water. In the meantime, I saw that he would be speaking at the Learning Annex in New York City on October 6, and I went to the lecture. I came away with a stronger desire than ever to learn more, and was positively impressed by Dr. Emoto's sincerity in observing that his work has raised by more questions that it has answered. Finally, The Hidden Messages in Water became available, and I read and enjoyed that book. I was pleased to see that it explained more than his lecture.I also ordered a copy of The True Power of Water to see what it contains. The book arrived yesterday, and it turned out to be a happy surprise when I read it last night.First, Dr. Emoto explains his research methods more in this book than he did in The Hidden Messages in Water or in the lecture. The key piece of new information about the method is that after the water is frozen, the water is thawed. As the ice thaws, crystals begin to form around the edges of the ice. It is those crystals that are photographed by Dr. Emoto's staff.Second, Dr. Emoto tells more about how the discoveries were made and his own background. He doesn't come from a scientific background . . . but rather than a perspective as an interested inquirer. He has gone about this the way most of us might do so.But he has enlisted the help of people with scientific training to help him develop the methods.Third, Dr. Emoto explains how HADO (vibrations) can cleanse water of its sources of pollution and improve your health. Basically, you expose water to certain kinds of writing and music. In addition, you emphasize HADO intensive foods.He offers anecdotal evidence that these approaches might work.Since there's not much involved to follow his advice, I decided to try it. I now have my own HADO bottle of water being cleansed and I plan to eat more of the HADO-intensive foods (they just happened to be among my favorites anyway).It's too soon to tell how it will all work out, but I don't think I can go very far wrong eating more vegetables and drinking more pure water.I suggest that you read and apply this book if you liked The Hidden Messages in Water. It cannot do you any harm . . . and it just might help you.As before the photographs are wonderful. I was especially interested in the images that showed overcoming pollution and the negative effects of microwave energy (from ovens, cell phones and computers) with prayers and music.May God bless you!"},{"Title":"The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves","review":"What could be more powerful than taking photographs of water crystals when exposed to the \\"energy\\" of different words?

No exaggeration. Dr. Emoto is a genius and this book takes his work further into the field of health and healing.

Like his first (The Hidden Power of Water),this is full of dozens of water crystal photos. The most stunning photos come from positive words written or spoken to the water samples before freezing and photographing. Beautiful crystals are also formed by playing classical or complex music to the samples; the ugly and deformed crystals have been subjected to heavy metal music. (When I called his office in Japan to get permission to show some of these photos in my workshops and presentations, one of Emoto(tm)s research assistants emphasized that \\"Dr. Emoto isn't against heavy metal music.\\" Water samples that were prayed to \\"\\"even though the water sample was polluted\\" also resulted in dazzling crystals.Emoto's research has led him to conclude that \\"water faithfully mirrors all the vibrations created in the world, and changes these vibrations into a form that can be seen with the human eye.\\"\\"Since our human body is about 70 percent water, do we also mirror and manifest the vibrations we surround ourselves with? If so, what kind of reality is that creating in our lives?\\"I cited Dr. Emoto's work in a foundation chapter on quantum physics and creating our reality in my book,Growing @ the Speed of Change: Your Inspir-actional How-To Guide For Leading Yourself and Others through Constant Change"},{"Title":"The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves","review":"This is a book telling us all about the hidden powers of water - which no one ever knew about before.

When you express your love and gratitude for water, it responds by forming beautiful crystals which love and heal your body. The ancients revered water and considered it sacred - which it is as it falls from the heavens - but in our age no one ever gives it a second thought.

We had a Japanese exchange student and she tried hard too. She was able to translate things from his work that are not available in English and we were terribly disappointed by what we found. His theories are not sound or even clearly outlined. His method is suspiciously vague. My husband and I are scientists (I studied Chemistry and Physics) and our exchange student is an aspiring scientist and we all like to believe the power of the mind is greater than is currently accepted.

There was not much science involved and nothing with provable evidence was put forth in the book. We are supposed to just accept Dr. Emoto's research that water changes shape when presented with different emotions based on one study with each emotion and no variables in the study. Even if his theories are based in science and not just completely made up, he failed to prove it in this book and instead wrote a study for the naive to help market his other products."},{"Title":"The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves","review":"I only browsed this book. What caught my interest was a series of photographs of ice crystals. Apparently, water can \\"respond\\" to written words taped to the side of the container. In fact, the water \\"knows\\" the meaning of the word regardless of language.Beautiful crystals form in response to positive words, while pathological crystals form from negative words--as hard as the water might \\"try\\" to form the nice crystal.In the back, where one might expect to find scientific references, is a long list of additional products available for purchase from the author or the publisher.The photographs are presented as evidence of the claim. But from a scientific point of view, they bring forth a number of questions. Do the photographs accurately correspond to the words as described? Have experimental conditions been carefully controlled? Only one photograph seems to be presented for each experiment--has the experimenter been able to reproduce those results? Have other experimenters been able to reproduce those results? Since the transmission of information to the water is a rather extraordinary explanation, is there any simpler explanation for the results? And even if the claim about water is true, how does that have any impact on our well being simply because the body is mostly water?I can't understand why people will waste time on this kind of non science. If you want to know something important about water, read about the depletion of aquifers in places like the southern Great Plains of the United States or in northwest China. Or read about how global warming threatens the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic. Of course water is a huge part of our environment and as that environment is degraded, so will our way of life. All the kind words in the world taped to the side of a glass won't save us--it takes real science to solve these problems."},{"Title":"The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves","review":"Another one you have to have an open mind for.

That an author can cause the reader to stop and think about firmly held belief systems, is indicative of a good writer in my opinion.The author of this bioethical treatise is not a physician. He is a sociologist, and he is giving the historical background to the immense changes in how the American public views its medical establishment. In the process of becoming involved in ethics in the medical world, Rothman had to come in close contact with those he was writing about...physicians. I get the feeling that he was and to a point still in awe of the great men and the great minds he has been exposed to. Occasionally, the book seemed to be biased in favor of the physicians. A book such as this cannot be written without showing the author's own biases; author's can only admit that they harbor particular biases towards those they are writing about.In many issues Rothman comes down solidly on behalf of the physicians, whether or not they brought about the changes in the public's attitudes towards those who work in medicine. Rothman bemoans the fact that the public has involved lawyers, bioethicists, and politicians in what used to be the private domain of physicians. Yet he writes and explains the history behind this lowering of pedestals for doctors and medical researchers...all the while trying to explain why physicians felt their patients should rely 'on those who know and understand' (read that to mean physicians think most patients and families are too stupid to understand basic concepts).This book actually gives a good and vitally important background into the movements for individual rights and the exposure of unethical experimentation and medical treatment which led to the creation of new standards for medical care and research, as well as the installment of Internal Research Boards (IRBs) which are suppose to act as brakes on over-ambitious and unethical practices. Unfortunately, it is all too clear in recent media reports that even IRBs in universities and hospitals are not enough to protect the American public from research by those not interested in protecting the patients and alleviating pain, but rather shows more concern for keeping the grant money coming, fame, and doing science merely for the sake of doing science ('because we can!) John Hopkins obviously hasn't changed its attitudes over 30 some odd years towards the rights of the individual, since they are continuing to attract attention and controversy because of unethical research.This book is definitely a must-read for anyone interested in bioethics. Even if the reader does not agree with the author, the book provides a different, and somewhat valid reflection of the medical establishment's views towards the infringement of their previously existing rights in determining patient care and the moral standards of research.

There are only a handful of characters and the dialouge is not hard to understand (though it isn't written in a modern dialect). While reading this play (I finished it in one night), I never once was confused or lost.Cliff Notes can be useful for long, boring, confusing works such as The Scarlet Letter.

I liked finding out about what &quot;We as Detroiters&quot; had to say about these issues, and I found myself agreeing with a lot of the findings because I see them on a daily basis. It is nice to have numbers to back up what are vague mental pictures of what the situation involves.I learned quite a bit about the area, things I didn't know about our history and about the present.

AT is a psychological (and philosophical, humanistic and social scientific) approach developed primarily from the works of A.N. Leont'ev (1903-1979).AT is really flourishing now, also in international and American psychology, in cognitive science and in information science. It is a strange paradox, however, that the basic texts are still not available for the English-speaking readers.Leontiev's psychology is closely related to that of Lev S. Vygotsky (1896-1934), father of the &quot;cultural historical&quot; or &quot;sociocultural&quot; or &quot;sociocognitive&quot; approach. There is no longer a need, however, to try to stress the importance of Vygotsky's works. He is described as &quot;the Mozart of psychology&quot; and his influence is dramatically growing (he is cited more than 5.600 times in the Social Sciences Citation Index, his &quot;Collected Works&quot; is published in six impressive volumes by Plenum Publ. Corporation; Routledge has published an impressive series of &quot;L.S. Vygotsky: Critical assessments&quot; (price 700$)and any course in developmental psychology these days introduces his thoughts, and they are also beginning to change the self-understanding of cognitive science in a fundamental way. So, Wygotsky is becoming main stream.The term &quot;activity theory&quot; also flourish. Although this is more related to the work of Leontiev (one of Vygotskys students and coworkers). Activity theory is - among other things - popular in studies of human-computer interaction. The very strange things is, however, that the basic texts are almost unavailable in English.Leontievs main work is in my opinion &quot;Problems of the development of the mind&quot; (Problemy razvitiia psikhiki). Published in English translation in Moscow by Progress in 1981. This book in not in the catalogue of Amazon, and it has not so far been possible for me to put it there and to review it. Another important book by Leontiev is &quot;Activity, consciousness, and personality&quot; (translated from Russian by Marie J. Hall from &quot;Deiatel'nost', soznanie lichnost'&quot;) Published: Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall, 1978. This book is not in the online catalogue of Prentice-Hall, and not in Amazon, and I have so far not been able to get it there for a review. (It is my hope that this review might inspire some publishers to make new editions).Why is Leontiev important? I could mention several reasons, but I shall limit myself to one, that of realism. The Danish psychologist Erik Schultz, 1988, p. 65+117 presents the following example: Imagine a teller. What is she doing? Why does she now tell the money? Why does she now speak with that customer? Why does she now turn to a colleague and gives him a piece of paper?How would different psychological approaches answer these questions? Psychoanalysis might try to explain the teller's behaviour by her unconscious conflicts, which can be traced to early childhood experiences. Behaviourism might try to explain it by referring to reactions to stimuli and to learned behaviour. Cognitivism might try to explain her behaviour by analysing what kind of information processing goes on in her brain, and so on. The \\"realistic\\" answer might be found in a detailed knowledge about the working organisation of the bank. Leontyev points out, that persons are not motivated by their biology, but by \\"the structure of production\\" (Leontyev, 1981).Leontievs theories have been very influencial in Denmark, in Germany, in Russia, and in other European countries. They have inspired the development of &quot;german critical psychology&quot; as well as other marxist and non-marxist approaches. An important non-marxist approach in Denmark is called &quot;anthropological psychology&quot; and has a strong influence.The book under review here presents philosophical discussions related to AT. They are important for those who know the basic theory already. But my primary purpose in writing this review has been to direct the attention towards the primary works of Leontiev. They have been so influencial in the countries where they have been available. Now we need the break-through in the English speaking world."},{"Title":"The Longman Anthology of British Literature (The Early Modern Period)","review":"This is an excellent anthology, with generous selections, lively introductions, and beautifully reproduced color plates. Though published on &quot;bible paper,&quot; there is very little bleed-through.

An old game in the 1950s used to be to send grad students in search of errors and typos in the standard literary critical books of the day. I'm sure these will be cleaned up.

Even in the KJV bible, Gos says that &quot;You fight not against man but against spirits and principalities&quot;A lot of what is in this book may sound wild and far-fetched to the average bible tumping, church person that doesn't know anything other than what &quot;Reverend Sunday&quot; tells them just before he passes around the plate to collect their paychecks. But for those that have an understanding of this reality and the next, it will make perfect sense and definitely has that &quot;Ring of truth&quot;. It is a worthy addition to the library of any seeker of truth, and to seek truth is to seek God - for God IS truth. So if you have any foreknowledge of spiritual things and some grasp of how this reality operates... then I definitely recommend this.One of the things I was confused about before was... Well, we all knew about Satans rebellion and the angels that sided with him and all were cast out. We all knew about the creation of mankind and some of us knew about Fallen angels seducing the human women. But in what order did all this take place? Who was here first? And WHY did these things happen in the order that they did?This book answers all of that. I'm even going to advertise it on my site, and no, I don't have any connection with anyone that published or wrote the book or anything of that nature... I just believe that TRUTH in spirituality is a rare thing these days and should be promoted.

I consider myself a nondenominational christian, so I am open to unorthodox views, if they can be supported by scriptures. Believe me there is a lot in this book that I disagree with, mainly the concept of reincarnation. But if I understand the way Charles DeLoach is presenting it, different than the traditional Eastern Hindu, Buddhists philosophy, I have to stop and think!The biblical example of Elijah as John the Baptist is compelling if not totally conclusive, but if that is true does that mean we are former angels? I can't tell you that I have it all figured out, but I appreciate the research Charles has done on this subject and I for one will prayerfully study it more. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Fan","review":"this book will keep you looking over your shoulder, to not trust men you dont know, to not take calls from strangers and to get a body guard if you are famous."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"I bought this book at a 99 cents only store - and it was worth MAYBE that price!!!

Actually it's very sad. The authors were all pretty girls who went to Hollywood and ended up on the dark side. For every wide eyed innocent who makes it big in movies there are 100 who end up in porn, prostitution, stripping or as groupies.The authors all were pathetic women who had encounters with some of Hollywoods sickest, meanest stars.

One question for the &quot;victims&quot;... If you are trying to help other women avoid the traps you fell into, why does this book have so many sexual details obviously meant to titilate the reader?. Nevertheless, it is fun to read how someone so dumb finally had the balls to name names, whether true or not.

It was disturbingly interesting. It was like passing a car wreck--you hate that you want to look. It's gossip about the sex lives of celebrities we see regularly on TV. The women telling the story took lie detector tests and private investigators back up their stories. If I read more books like this, I will have a hard time watching TV!!"},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"Joanne Parrent, the feminist former screenwriter who compiled these accounts from high-priced call girls, is a very angry woman, with good reason. (Try googling her.) The trouble is her introduction puts men who would otherwise be on her side on the defensive. I note several angry reviews here.The call girls' accounts are more complex, varying from outrage to the kind of titillation you find in the pseudo-exposes so popular in porn literature. The difference here is that these women name very famous and admired names. It's hardly news that wealthy men will take advantage of beautiful young drug addicts for sex ranging from ordinary to perverted and sadistic. But given the money and expensive gifts these women get, it's often hard to sympathize with them.Ms. Parrent briefly mentions that prostitutes serve men of all walks and stations in life. But she fails to say anything about the poorer johns who are also victimized by the prostitutes, pimps and madams. Of domestic violence, she writes mainly about O.J. Simpson's acquital, which just happened before the book went to print, so her white hot anger is understandable. But there is nothing about the complexities of ordinary domestic violence. The fact is that the Battle of the Sexes is filled with walking wounded on both sides. I say to readers who have issues with the opposite sex, you may find this book hard going."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"It's interesting at first because of the shock value of hearing about the celebrities involved. After reading for a bit it gets almost mundane hearing about their drug and sexual adventures. Nothing ever seems to change and nobody seems to learn anything."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"Every profession has its successes and its failures, including prostitution. This book is about four failed hookers. Despite their (constantly reiterated) popularity with various &quot;johns,&quot; all four of these women were lousy whores. Why? Because each of them became a prostitute in the mistaken impression that they would receive male love and approval for their sexual talents. Despite the colossal sums of money they were paid, not one of the four treats her stint &quot;in the life&quot; as a freely chosen career which gave them a chance to make an enormous amout of money in a short time. Paradoxically, these women expected their clients to treat them as wives or girlfriends, rather than as businesswomen selling their sexual services. They lamentplaintively about men treating them like meat, but not once do any of them face up to the fact that they treated their clients as cash cows, demanding and getting large sums for acts that millions perform everyday for nothing. Any successful whore must realize sooner or later that men pay for her company as much as for a sex act. In truth, despite the poor-little-me scenarios developed for each of the women, these girls come across as a bunch of selfish, self-indulgent, manipulative, and totally unselfconscious bimbos without one iota of personality to offer. This book is a slick, entertaining page-turner perfect for reading in the bathroom. I loved every word of it."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"Ok, so its the Jerry Springer of literature, but its bawdy and lecherous and rowdy and doesn't command any brain function whatsoever on my part. In other words, I read it for the same reason I still watch jerry Springer. It gives me a taste of the seedy side of life with no actual effort from me."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"This is by no means great literature, but then again who cares when all the stars' sexual secrets are exposed for your curious voyeristic mind? It's basically a bunch of high-priced call girls kissing (actually much more) and telling. The male celebrities are seen for what they are - pigs, and it's so refreshing. But, can you take it seriously? Probably not. The woman from this book all sound bitter &amp; vengeful. It's a fun read though -- gossip always is!"},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"I didn't buy this book, but read it quickly at the local thrift shop. I felt sorry for these girls when I started reading this book, but the feeling mostly left me near the end of it. These girls wanted to be famous,rich and successful in Hollywood. I believe one should follow his or her dreams, but do so wisely. The key word here is wisely. To make it in Hollywood or anywhere else you need talent, hard work and persistence. Hollywood is a buisness and they are not going to hire people who will not make them money. Thats the bottom line truth. You dont make it in Hollywood or anywhere else by offering sexual favors and being used. All you end up with is a loss of dignity, anger and mental scars. What is telling about this account is how these girls seemed to enjoy what they were doing. They endured some traumatic situations but they never left doing sexual favors. This is what makes me think it was written more for sex appeal than truth. No one is stopping these girls from getting out of this nightmare. They could have packed up and left town, gone to school, gotten help from drug rehabs in L.A. and other alternatives. Instead they go from one rotten experience to the other. I dont buy their claim they couldnt get out because they were feeding their drug habit. They eventually got out. So why not sooner than later? Their stories come out as mostly self indulgent. That is, I can't get what I want, so I'm going to turn to prostitution and drugs. Its only after a lot of horrible experiences that they decide to lead a normal life. This implies they would do anything to make it in Hollywood and when all else fails, they stoop to lead a normal life. This is why it comes off as sounding mostly pathetic. What stunned me somewhat is the arrogance of these \\"celebrities.\\" Its ironic that these celebrities are used by groupies and the media among others for their own ends. Groupies sleep with them for example, to get bragging rights. They couldn't care less about them. Thats why they're one night stands. I know about Hollywood, having been involved with it in one way or another. I won't say more than that. If you can't make it in hollywood then do the smart thing and GET OUT! At least you will save your dignity and sanity. You won't waste your time in dealing with bottom feeders and sharks."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"Yeah, it was trashy, but I got it for 2 bucks. The girls in the book try to come of as these poor mistreated soles, when they are really just sluts and whores. The Johns wouldn't be Johns without sluts like them. They are using each other. But hey, it was very interesting. And I read the sequel too."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"Despite the promise of \\"honest reflection\\" and that \\"this is the book from which Hollywood will never recover\\" (from the front flap) it is nothing but trash.

Sadly, this book is yet another way that these women have disrespected themselves."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"A very entertaining book, but not very thought-provoking and extremely biased. I've lived in Hollywood and I can tell you that not every little girl is a victim. None of these ho's would complain if Brad Pitt offered them a million dollars to sleep with them.

Young"},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"This book is basically a tell-all expose written by former prostitutes-to-the-stars. As such, it can be highly entertaining, even if some of the more outlandish claims should certainly be taken with a grain of salt.Inexplicably, however, one of the chapters is written by a former lover of mine (identified as &quot;Liza&quot; in the book) who claims that I attempted to involve her in an international prostitution ring with promises of a highly paid modelling gig in Paris.One must first of all question what my name is doing in a book like this in the first place, alongside those of Sylvester Stallone and George Harrison, among many others. While I was a fairly successful Hollywood &quot;player&quot; (i.e., producer, agent, etc.) for many years, my name certainly never became anything close to a household name for the outside world.More importantly, &quot;Liza&quot;'s claims are entriely unfounded. Regarding the week-long job in Paris involving the Arab businessmen: she knew full well what she was getting into. Indeed, she had &quot;worked&quot; for me (locally in Los Angeles) without so much as a complaint on many previous occasions. In this particular case, she was extremely well paid and got a free trip to Paris to boot -- so it is quite beyond me why she sought to misportray the experience in the book in question.In any event, the title plays out quite nicely in the case of &quot;Liza&quot; -- she really didn't sleep in that town again... at least not on a paid basis."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"It seemed like a good idea at the time, and the price was right (...). The writing was no great shakes, and proved to be a greater distraction than the womens' seeming inability to learn any sort of lessons from previous experiences.

It names the names and details the perversions. There are no heroes or heroines in this book, dear reader. The four women who wrote their 'memoirs' are some of the silliest, stupidest, most banal creatures ever to stalk the earth. I loved the story about the woman who 'serviced' George Harrison about two minutes after she met him. Then she got angry that he never asked her name. You just want to shake the pathetic girl and holler, 'You're a HOOKER! You're a GROUPIE! They don't WANT to know your name!' The men don't come off as any better: slaves to their wee-wees, intoxicated with the power of their money and fame, able to get anything for a price. Hollywood is revealed as a place where shallowness, money, idiocy and bimbos reign (surprise, surprise, surprise). So, no big revelations--unless learning about Stallone's very abnormal fetish is your idea of a good time. (And after you read it, think about the big lunk earning $22 million a picture. Do we as a nation have our priorities screwed up or what?)"},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"I read this book within 2 days and then I read it again. I loved all that movie star gossip. I dont think i will ever look at Vanna White, James Cann, Sylvester Stallone, Warren Beatty, Bob Evans, and lots of others, the same way again.

I fell in love with Robin, Liza, Linda,and Tiffany. These women have seen and been through so muchbut have risen to overcome the darkness that held a shroudover their lives for so long. Without giving to much away,there are stories of producer Don Simpson's violent S &amp; Mpractices, Lorenzo Lamas' insensitivity, Hugh Heffner'spassion for watching, and so many other stories that willshock and sadden you at the same time. This is an importantbook that must be read to be beieleved. It will also strikea cord in your heart. It makes you wish you could reach ahand out and help save these young ladies who go toHollywood with the dreams of being someone special, only tobe drug deep into the scum and filth that actually lieswithin even though they should know that they already arespecial like everyone else. After reading this book, youwill lose respect for the dirty business of Hollywood butwill become more open minded to what is seen and felt bysomeone who needs to be loved and not used. Give these girlsa chance, they deserve to be heard."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because it appears to be true.It provides insights into the lives of people who have the resources to create a living hell for themselves in preparation for what I assume is waiting just ahead for them.However I suffer from mild depression and this book doesn't help any.The second case study was particularly disturbing. Here's a tormented soul who was sexually molested, raped by sex fiends, and slit her wrists twice by the time she reached about age 20.The father can take credit for the rape. He allowed a 12 year old girl to go to a strange house with strange people who he knew were in the pornography business. Anyone with even minimal intelligence would realize this was a dangerous situation for a young girl.She was wreckless and exploitive of herself also. Prostitution is after all an exploitive activity.The second case study came very close to getting pulled into a white slavery ring in Paris. This was done under the guise of a modelling engagement by an enterprising individual who turned out to be cunning, devious, and sinister.If that would have happened the things in this book would be kids' stuff compared to what would have happened to her. I assume her family and friends would never have seen or heard from her again.Girls thinking about getting into prostitution should be intelligent about going to strange places with strange people, especially about going to another country. In a situation like that the line between asking someone to do something and forcing them against their will is very thin. You can never be sure who you'll run into in that business.Danger and death are always lurking in the shadows of this dark world.The sequel to this book, \\"Once More With Feeling\\", gives a better idea of the negative side of prostitution. They all don't go to parties at mansions and make tons of money. As this book shows even those that do are miserable anyway. Many don't escape with their lives.Not that this book presents prostitution as a bed of roses either.There are some common denominators that lead girls onto this path:1) lack of family structure or abusive home life2) drug abuse which impairs judgement3) enticement of 'easy' money and luxury4) naivety and lack of experience in life5) no way to support themselves financially (caused by other factors above like drugs)6) to some extent low self esteem and self respectMost of the girls in both books have at least some of these characteristics."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"I walked away from this book with conflicting views about it and its contents.On one hand, I felt very sorry for the girls about some of the experiences they had, but one of the girls still seemed somewhat smug about the sexual experiences she had with certain celebrities and considering the fact that she said she had suffered so much , that kind of dampened the effect of the horrific things she went through.Another thing is that 3 of the girls kept going on in their sections about how sexy and beautiful they were or how hot their bodies were or how hot and sexy they looked at any given moment.I'm sure that they are all beautiful girls-I think its a given that prostitutes to the stars would have to be very attractive-it got kind of grating hearing it repeated over and over again.I think its sad the way they allowed themselves to be used and degraded for so long , but I do admire them for writing this book as a cautionary tale for young women though.Although every girls story was a sad one,Liza stirred my sympathy the most.I hope they are all doing well now."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"Total trash. Funny, the women tell their stories but none of the real consequences like STDs, unwanted pregnancies, abuse. Fast read without substance. Good for an airplane. Bought it because it was cheap.

It's not well written. It is interesting that these 4 women are only identified by first name (and we don't even know if those first names given are correct) and yet they name real Hollywood names over and over. Big names with big perversions too. Don't read this book if you don't want to be grossed out next time you see a Jack Nicholson or Sylvester Stallone and now know many details of their kinky sexual engagements in having women urinate and defecate on them. And what happens with big producer Robert Evans is so gross as to make anyone lose their lunch. The names and all the very sordid details are here on the brutish, cold, crass, bisexual drug using and gross sexual antics of people such as Jack Nicholson, George Harrison, Sylvester Stallone, Warren Beatty, Bob Evans,Lorenzo Lamas, Hugh Heffner, David Crosby, Vanna White, Billy Idol.I wonder why the stars named didn\`t sue. Some of them look like total criminal perverts."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"This book can't decide if it is Celebrity Gossip or anti-prostitution.While starting out with a blurb from someone writing about the terrible world of women being dragged down into prostitution, the girls go on talking about their jobs with the calmness of a fast-food worker talking about his job. The women ramble on for pages and pages about the gifts they got and the free shopping sprees, and they would even talk about the sex in a non-committal way. For some of them, it only seems like they felt like they were wronged when they were spurned by their \\"boyfriends\\".Don't get me wrong, that world really does chew up women and spit them out. It's just this book does a really inconsistent job of pointing that out to readers.Also - if you were born past the time this book covers, or like me during that era weren't paying attention a lot of attention to soaps and gossip magazines, the \\"big names\\" won't mean squat to you."},{"Title":"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again","review":"I don't know.

And then they complain b/c the men didn't have \\"feelings\\" for them. Uh, they are call girls. It IS all about sex. It IS all about their sexy bodies. This book is supposed to make us aware of the pitfalls of prostitution. I just see the pitfalls of stupidity. They willingly spent their money on drugs. No one forced them to blow (literally) their money. They weren't beaten/forced into prostitution by sick fathers/boyfriends. They were beautiful young girls who willingly used their bodies to gain entry to celebrities, money, parties, drugs. And now I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Whatever.

It provides not only a sound understanding of the state-of-the art technology involved in CVD for contemporary microelectronic applications, but also enunciates the basic principles and fundamental physical laws which are necessary for a detailed understanding of the subject. I found the informal pedagogy scheme followed by the authors as an useful approach, making the complex topic interesting, while at the same time the text equips the reader with the terminology which constitutes the technical parlance on the subject. For example, the authors have (thankfully) clarified and clearly defined various terms (to mention a few) like \`sccm', \`diffusion length', \`step coverage', \`reactive sticking coefficient', \`gap filling', and the various dimensionless numbers including Reynold's number, Peclet number and Knudsen number- all of which are of routine utility for the practicing technologist, but unfortunately are often not addressed in a single text on the subject.The book addresses the various reactor technologies involved in CVD, along with the system configurations. While on the one hand, it introduces the reader to the various essential system modules and their functions in the CVD process, on the other hand, it outlines the basic physical and-chemical laws which define the different elements of the CVD reactor. The chemistry, kinetics and reaction mechanisms of silicon-dioxide and silicon-nitride deposition are covered in much detail, giving valuable insight into these two applications. Various other CVD films of importance to microelectronics are covered as well. The coverage is comprehensive, and the wide range of topics that the authors have beautifully brought together makes it an optimal introduction to the understanding of physical laws, and their application in CVD technology.The idiom of the text makes it an easy, yet highly informative compilation on CVD. Process engineers, researchers, reactor designers and practicing technologists should find the detail covered in the book to be very useful. This book bridges the gap between core fundamental laws and their application in CVD technology."},{"Title":"Petunia","review":"I recently purchased this book for my kids.

But that was the best thing that could have happened to the silly goose cause it humbled her back to where her little neck belonged and teaches her its not enough to just carry a book but to learn to read it and thats the way to be wise in your mind and your heart, and maybe then she can truly help her friends! Absolute Classic!!! A good spoonful of humble pie right at bedtime."},{"Title":"Petunia","review":"I was born in 1973, and spent a lot of my youth reading and rereading Petunia. We also had copies of the books on audio cassette. I loved listening to them at home and in the car. Petunia stories are delightful and usually have a moral to relate. I truly cannot imagine anyone not liking Petunia. I have passed on the love of Petunia books to my two young boys, 8 and 4. We have Petunia and Petunia's Christmas. I highly recommend any of these books to the young and the old alike. My favorite Petunia quote is \\"Now I understand. It was not enough to carry wisdom under my wing. I must put it in my mind and in my heart. And to do that I must learn to read.\\" (from the book \\"Petunia\\"). What's not to love about that?"},{"Title":"Petunia","review":"This is a book I remembered vaguely from my own childhood and bought for my son on a whim. He loves it. In fact, he received it on Christmas day and has insisted that it be read at bedtime every night since then. Literally.So, will your child love it? Probably so. Will you? Probably so, at first. For our part, my husband and I are growing a little weary of it. But in the land of childrens books, that's probably the best you can hope for, right?The illustrations are fun and entertaining and the language is clear and fun. I'd give this as a gift again, or would certainly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Petunia","review":"I was saddened to see that Petunia was out of print. I wanted to order a copy for each of the first grade students who I worked on this class play with this year. The book has a great moral to it, is hilarious to the younger set and has such cute illustrations. I remembered this book from my childhood and will order an out-of-print copy for my son. Any publishers out there--&quot;Please reprint the Petunia books!&quot;"},{"Title":"Petunia","review":"This was for my 2-year old granddaughter and she liked it very much. The artwork is very imaginative as the parents read the story."},{"Title":"Petunia","review":"I do not appreciate when I have to fill this out with a specific number of words when one is enough; SUCCESS"},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"Traditional tales like Goldilocks are a great way to expose young children to language. It can be difficult to find traditional versions of classic folktales with good illutstrations. My three-year old loves this version of Goldilocks and is totally engrossed in the detailed illustrations every time we read this book."},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"This is a beautiful Goldilocks book with the most amazing illustrations you will find anywhere! Illustrations make or break a book for me, and this one does not disappoint. My daughter is almost 3 and wants to hear this story over and over, and I love to read it to her.VERY highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"I absolutely adore this book because it harkens back to the Victorian era, both in illustrations and in language. It is witty and moral, without being preachy. There are several really nice personal touches throughout the book that bring the characters to life. My 4 year old daughter really fell in love with this book and often refers back to it during her imaginative play! Well done!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"I must admit it was the illustrations that lured me into purchasing this book and am now a real fan of Ms. McClintock. Somewhat reminiscent in style of the Victorian Illustrator and cartoonist for PUNCH, Sir John Tenniel of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" fame. Now if only this duo would do Grimm's \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" all would be right with the world! It would be so nice to see more illustrators such as Ms. McClintock give a child's imagination something from which they may take pleasure. I think we may see this illustrator follow in the path of such illustrious names as Kate Greenaway, Anne Andersen, Gennady Spirin, etc.! Bravo and many thanks!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"This is a fairly traditional version of Goldilocks. What makes it better than some of the others is the beautiful illustrations. Also, the book contains a recipe for Oatmeal Raisin cookies. They are so good, I have made this my permanent recipe. My children really enjoy the book, too."},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"It approximated my memory of a well written and well illustrated version unlike most cartoon-like,oversimplified versions. That allllllall and all!"},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"This is my absolute favorite version of this classic tale. It brings up all the aspects that most ignore but are very important when reading it to preschoolers. Things like how it is not showing good manners to eat someone else's food without asking and you should never snoop around someones house especially when you were not invited. Also, it points out that Golidlock's does not listen to her mother and that could have been dangerous; you should never run off by yourself or go into someone's house you don't know. I also love the Mama Bear's Porridge Cookie recipe on the back. I make them every year with my preschool class. It's longer then most, but the story and illustrations are worth it."},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"After reading the other reviews, I chose this version of the classic tale. Although I like the book fine, it is a little too wordy for my taste, although what I really don't care for are the facial expressions of Goldilocks. I like all the other illustrations fine, except for most of those of Goldilocks' face. In some of the illustrations her face looks like an adult and in others her face looks like she is mentally disturbed. I think it every time we read it to our daughter."},{"Title":"Goldilocks And The Three Bears","review":"I read the book Goldilocks And The Three Bearsby Jim Aylesworth and illustrated by BarbaraMcClintock. This book is about a little girl named Goldilocks who snuck in the three bearshouse eating their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and sleeping in their beds. The authorwrote this story because he wanted to tell youthat don't go on peoples property withoutpermission. The conflict is person verses personbecause Goldilocks went in the three bears house without permission. I think Goldilocksis sneaky and the author made the three bearsnice and understanding. The other version ofGoldilocks And The Three Bears is the sameas this one. Kids should read this book because they will learn a lesson to respect people's property.I liked this book because I like how the author wrote the story because it wasn't too easy or too hard. I didn't like the book because I didn't like the book because I didn't like the illustrations because they looked kind of weird."},{"Title":"THE COMPLETE PETERKIN PAPERS WITH ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS","review":"This is exactly the book I'd been wanting. I was raised on this book. I've had many copies of The Peterkin Papers; it was kind of a quest, when I was younger, to give copies away to people I thought would appreciate it. When I was a child, it was the only thing that would make me laugh on a predictable basis -- being read to by my Dad, out of this book. For a long time, I could order new copies of the paperback edition. Then it was out of print for a while, and I regretted having given it away to whoever the last person was. What a relief to finally get a copy again,this time of the Complete edition, after many years of doing without even the basic one! I can't imagine wanting to have different illustrations -- the line drawings are such a treat! I named two of my cats, Solomon John and Agamemnon, after two brothers in the stories. It's in good shape, and came when I was expecting it. I'm very happy with it."},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"Kinderlager presents the adult recollections of three women's childhood experiences in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Dr. Nieuwsma has skillfully woven together three tragic stories into a disturbing perspective on man's ultimate inhumanity to his fellow man. Regardless of one's knowledge of the Holocaust, the reader cannot help but be moved by the horrific death camp experiences suffered by the inmates, as seen through the naive eyes of young children. Three girls were robbed of their families and their childhood, as were their entire generation, and they grew up surrounded by starvation, torture and death as their normality. Yet in the face of this ultimate adversity, these three children survived through a combination of fortitude and providence. Kinderlager forces us to ask ourselves very pointed and disagreeable questions. What kind of people could commit such atrocities against children? And how could the world let this happen?The experiences of Tova, Frieda and Rachel serve as a grim reminder of what happened, and more importantly, what must never be allowed to happen again."},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"This book is one of the few such non-fiction works thataccomplishes several goals while still reaching an audience that, inmy opinion, spans in age from the old to the very young. The graphicaccounts and descriptions may seem too harsh at first for youngreaders, however, the subtle tone and easy language turns a tragicstory into a recognizable tale of pain, perseverance, and ultimatestrength. I've been around these stories my whole life, and though Ifound it very hard as a child to read such accounts, I would recommendusing this book as a tool to teach children about the past so they canbetter direct their future...I hope you read my mother's story andhelp your children understand what happened, what can happen, and whatshould never happen again."},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"The author has given us an extraordinary and sensitive look into the lives of three children who were survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Afer reading the story of the first girl, I was compelled to continue reading each of the others. The reading is easy, and the author tied each of the child's stories together in such a way that I could not put the book down until I had read it all the way through! As I read it, I was struck, once again, by the inhumanity of the whole Auschwitz experience, but I was also encouraged by the incidents of kindness and strength that were skillfully woven into each child's story . This story of the experience and endurance of these young girls related to us at this point in their adult lives is a &quot;must&quot; reading for all of us who know who we must never forget........"},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"This book is great! Although the conditions of the Jews were horrible, I enjoyed reading this remarkable story. It is more like three stories, becuse three young survivers each tell about their time in Auchwitz. Their names are Rachel, Frieda, and Tola. I enjoyed this historic book and you will, too!"},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"This is a great book! I read it for the first time about a year ago, and it is still one of my favorite books! It is very helpful for school projects!"},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"Kinderlager was a great book. It dipped into all the senses. In the book the feelings of three different people were expressed in three different books. The books were all about the time they spent in the Holocaust. In some way or another they all met up with each other in the labor camps. The book explains these peoples' experiences and grieving in great detail. The reason why I liked this book so much was because it was real. Just knowing those people really lived through those harsh conditions... it made the book more effective. I recommend this book to anyone don't miss out on the chance to read it!"},{"Title":"Kinderlager: An Oral History of Young Holocaust Survivors","review":"This book was a finalist for the 1999 Society of Midland Authors Annual Book Awards contest in the category of children's nonfiction."},{"Title":"The Clematis Tree","review":"I read the back of the book and thought this would be a blow by blow account of looking after a brain damaged child. I found that the story gripped me from the very first page and kept me reading since instead it is a study of the charactsers in the family surrounding the child. The inner turmoil of the father and the unexpected unfolding of events beyond the control of the parents in the family make this a gripping read. Anne Widdecombe's writing is superb and alternates detailed dialogue and inner thoughts with succinct summaries of conversations and the aftermath of various events. The final denoument is unexpected, poignant and beautifully written. We are left hoping that the family will find happiness in the end and the father's turmoil is over.I look forward to seeing a televised version of the Clematis Tree."},{"Title":"Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8): A Memoir of Love, Exile, and Crosswords","review":"This is a clever, quirky little book. The cover says it is a memoir of love, exile and crosswords, but it actually defies categorisation. It isn't really a memoir - the writer is quite selective about which doors of his life are opened to the reader. We know he becomes a crossword afficianado and has a deep fondness for his adopted country (England, he is an ex pat South African) and for his \\"girlfriend\\", a title that becomes somewhat grating as the book progresses and she becomes central to his life and the mother of his chidren. But along with a few snippets about his professional life, that's about all he gives away about himself. The story is more a series of recollections of moments in time which he describes for their life importance and for their association with where he was at the same time, in his development as a crypiic crossword afficianado. The originality and cleverness of the book is in the way it is a history of the development of cryptic crosswords and and their setters, and a \\"how to do them\\" guide, (arguably a fairly dry subject) which is flavoured up with human interest by being embedded in some important events in the writer's life. Definitely recommended for those who love doing cryptic crosswords and those who aspire to do them. Probably of less interest to those who consider crosswords to be only for nerdy types who need to get a real life. (Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose - answer, rebelled - if you can't work it out and are itching to know why, buy the book!!)"},{"Title":"Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8): A Memoir of Love, Exile, and Crosswords","review":"I wish Balfour had concentrated more on his love of crosswords and less on the memoir. The crossword discussion and examples were fascinating and educational. I've learned a great deal on the art of solving the cryptic variety of crosswords. By the end of the book my chances of solving these clues had gone from none to slim. The deciding factor now is a matter of culture. So many of the clues in the British puzzles relate to British culture and/or slang as well they should. I'm fairing better with the clues in the Games Magazine cryptic crosswords which is a huge step forward for me."},{"Title":"Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8): A Memoir of Love, Exile, and Crosswords","review":"At first impression this seems to be a wandering memoir focussed on the author's love of crosswords with a few personal details thrown in. But as you read on, it becomes clear Balfour is writing a long love letter to his girlfriend, who introduced him to crossword puzzles. As he explains lucidly how he slowly began to understand the way the puzzles were put together, he slips in more and more details about his girlfriend. As you wonder whether they stayed together, you learn that she is pregnant with their first child. Time passes on, he gets better and better jobs, and suddenly she is giving birth to their third child. This is a wonderful piece of writing and one I cannot recommend highly enough."},{"Title":"Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8): A Memoir of Love, Exile, and Crosswords","review":"Sandy Balfour, South African by birth, but foreign in other countries since his 21st birthday, writes his memoir which he links inextricably with crosswords. It has a strange disembodied quality to it. It is almost as though Balfour is narrating someone elses life. It is reflective of the crosswords he adores, that sometimes the clues have layers to them, just like his life seems to be. Nothing, like a cryptic crossword, is straightfoward.It is a slow and layered biography which seems to be at times oa series of interlinked anecdotes about what happened in his life and how it fits in with the crossword clues of that time. Even the title of the book is a crossword clue and reflects his life.For those clues he doesn't solve, or even the ones where the answer is in the text there is a page in the back which talks about how to solve the particular clue, in case you didn't understand how the answer of reached. So you get the double benefit of learning to solve cryptic crosswords, if you didn't already know.I quite liked this book. It was quite a different type of read but enjoyable and I found it oddly compelling. It wasn't that Balfour was a sympathetic character, or even Oprah-like in his confessions. It was such an unusual book and well written which made it so interesting. My only distraction was the at times jerky connection of events which, in the context of a crossword are fine, but didn't work as well for the connection of a series of life events."},{"Title":"Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8): A Memoir of Love, Exile, and Crosswords","review":"What can one say that will accurately describe this book?That it's a marvelous memoir that reads like a novel? Yes!That it's a special treat for cruciverbalists of the cryptic kind? Most definitely!That it's quite unlike anything you've ever read? ProbablyThat Sandy Balfour should just keep writing more and more? Most assuredly!But, to sum it up in a phrase...?O.K. *A truly fun read (reed)!!![.]"},{"Title":"Venus in Pink: An Illustrated Tribute to Japanese Pink Movies & Softcore Porn Starlets","review":"Reading the editorial reviews above for this particular book, I was under the assumption that this book would give a critical and written overview of the Japanese \\"Pink\\" Sex Film Dramas (aka RomanPorn). I was especially wanting to get some background information on some of the key studios (such as Nikkatsu, Toei) which produced these films in the 70's as well as a index to all the major starletts. Much to my disappointment the book only had a very short (one page) introduction and a even shorter summary (two pages) detailing the Japanese Pink Film Industry of the 70's and early 80's. The rest of the book was primarily comprised of black & white stills and photos of the various Japanese Pink Film stars (and not very clear or good ones I might add). In yet another miscalculation, the book's editors even failed to mention who is being pictured and from what film the particular still was taken from (although I think it might have been in the acknowledgement sections). Definitely not for those wanting to \\"read\\" about the Japanese RomanPorn films of the 70's. From even the basest erotic level, this book fails."},{"Title":"Venus in Pink: An Illustrated Tribute to Japanese Pink Movies & Softcore Porn Starlets","review":"I knew that it was primarily a book of still photos. However, what I did not know was that the selection of photos would not be that good. There are much better photos out there that have been published elsewhere. Also, none of the photos are identified by the movie title they are from or who is in the photos. Someone could publish a very good photo book on the pink films, identifying the films and the actors but this is not it."},{"Title":"The Railway labor act at fifty: Collective bargaining in the railroad and airline industries","review":"Paperback, edited by Charles M.

When I picked up the book I first looked for and found stories of the famed 24th Infantry Regiment, one of the black regiments founded right after the Civil War of mostly veterans and freed slaves.From there I found myself fascinated by the stories of individual African Americans in military service. It is clear that the colored, then negro, then black, then African American soldiers have more than earned their place in the sun. I can only hope that this book shines that light."},{"Title":"Balls!: 6 Rules for Winning Today's Business Game","review":"I bought this book because, evidently, a lot of people who bought Keith Ferrazzi's book (about forging powerful connections with influetntial people -- see my review) bought this one as well. I approached it, then, as an exposition about the kind of personal courage it takes to shine in what can be intimidating situations. However, this was not the case. Alas, BALLS! is an acronym -- B is for Brave, A is for Authentic, L is for Loud, L is for Loveable, S is for Spunky, ! is for Go (I say ! is for \\"huh?!!!!\\")Alexi Venneri does come off as having boundless enthusiasm and if I were ever into team sports, I would be glad if she were head cheerleader for my team. But, that is really the substance of the book. These are not so much \\"Rules for Winning\\" as they are favorite cheers.I did get a kick out of learning about her boss in the \\"B\\" section of the book. He is a worthy entrepreneurial role model. The rest of the \\"case studies\\" are from other people in her employer's company or their client-companies. The stories are spun or cherry-picked to fit the acronym. It's a little like the tail is wagging the dog. Research was not conducted to find out what works in today's business games. For that matter, what these games are was never defined, let alone rules identfied. Instead, it's more like a 2005, white-collar version of Studs Terkel stories fitting into BALLS categories. And I'm not enticed to try any of them. For example, I would never hire actors to picket a competitor's conference (I gasped when I read this one.)In the final analysis, I.C.B.I.S.T.R.A.B.W.A.A.F.A.T.

She gave me a copy of Balls! and I read it through on the plane home.I think she's somehow managed to package her personality to a great extent in this quick read, and I was forcefully impressed with one message: to get your enterprise noticed ahead of the pack, you need a positive, pro-customer attitude, but also some temerity and you have to give yourself permission to be a little outragious. Just that single lesson, which for me translated into creating attention without spending tons on advertising, was worth it.So I've ordered a few more for my friends in the same business (but not for my competitors!)T.

And I was not disappointed. Each story was so well-written and really hit home. The impact of the Holocaust on our generation is not to be underestimated and as a gay Jewish man, this seems all that more powerful. The most moving story was that of Great Aunt Rose (ironically I also had a Great Aunt Rose). That reallz made me think, espeiallz how Raphael says that Americans always want to analyze. I really thought that the story written for class was so wonderful. Imagine my surprise when Rose is just devastated."},{"Title":"Dancing on Tisha b'Av","review":"Snippets of day to day life, told from the viewpoint of being both Gay &amp; Jewish, with which any Gay man can identify regardless of his religion. Enlightening for anyone Jewish who believes Gays must be different from straights; comforting in its affirmaton that we are not unique in our feelings."},{"Title":"Dancing on Tisha b'Av","review":"Lev Raphael is a talented author. The book, Dancing on Tisha B'Av, brings together nineteen short stories. Throughout his writing, Raphael interweaves his own life story into the stories of his characters. In many of the stories, Raphael's characters explore the intersection and interplays of their Gay and Jewish identities.This collection was compiled in 1990. Throughout, you can feel the alienation and exclusion of the characters, but also the tremendous sense of happiness and peace that comes from a knowledge of self and personal integrity. The stories offer lessons to all readers, Gay or Straight, Jewish or non-Jewish.The strength of Dancing on Tisha B'Av comes from the short-story format. Each of the stories is a relatively quick read, so readers with limited time will be able to progress through the book with ease. While themes are repeated throughout the book, each story is self-contained. The reader will be able to put the book down and come back to it later without feeling compelled to re-read.This collection does suffer from monotony after a while. Each story places the characters in similar circumstances that begin to seem rote and uninteresting. For example, in nearly every story the main character is either a graduate English student or on the English faculty at one of a handful of universities. After a while, a sense of re-reading the same story over and over begins to develop.Perhaps the most powerful story in this collection was \\"Abomination\\" which tells the story of a temporary Professor of English whose reactions to homophobia on campus are influenced by her parent's experience in the Holocaust and her gay brother. This story is unique in that it explores the emotions and feelings of those around the gay person, rather than the gay person themself. This theme is also explored in the story \\"Dancing on Tisha B'Av\\" for which the book gets its name.Raphael's Dancing on Tisha B'Av is worth a read, particularly for gay Jews and those around them who are struggling to reconcile their Gay and Jewish identities. As individual stories the writings are wonderful reflections on identity and the reactions of others to those identities. As a collection, however, the stories become repetitious and lose some of their power. Take your time and enjoy each story for its own contributions and merits."},{"Title":"The sonnets of William Shakespeare (New Aldine library)","review":"William Shakespeare is best known as a playwright. When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"The sonnets of William Shakespeare (New Aldine library)","review":"Just received it today (7-12-2010).

I just finished re-reading my copy from 20 years ago. The pages are yellowing, but the story is as good as ever, in spite of my knowing what was going to happen.The book deals with a small band of explorers who have some to a mysterious planet in search of metallic hydrogen. Their ship crashes and they are forced to assimilate themselves into the native cultures in order to survive.But all is not as it seems! The planet is as astrophysical anomoly. First, it's year is 1000 standard days, while it takes 750 standard days to rotate. Or, as one character expresses it, &quot;In a few months it'll be noon.&quot;The world's size is an even bigger (pun intended) mystery: at 600,000 km in diameter, it is almost as large as it's star, yet the surface gravity is &quot;normal&quot;.But as I indicated before, the story is a good read even if you know the solution to the mystery. The plot is interesting, the characters are both alien and believable. The only disappointment that I have is that this is the only fiction that the author has published. Tony Rothman was an astrophysics student when he wrote this book, and since graduating he seems to have confined himself to textbooks, and one autobiography (of a sort). But if he ever publishes anything else, you can be sure that I'll be first in line to buy a copy."},{"Title":"The World Is Round","review":"The World is Round combines two of my favorite science fiction themes, the planet of mystery and the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Along the way some of the characters experience spiritual growth in a non-didactic manner.The planet of mystery is huge and has an extremely unhospitable climate caused by its year long day--its name in the native language translates to &quot;Freeze-Bake&quot;. A group of adventurers land on the planet searching for metallic hydrogen and have a more than interesting time.The two &quot;native&quot; races provide an interesting cultural dichotomy--one is organized on military lines, the other on communal principles. In spite of the density of ideas, there is an exciting plot involving discovering the secret of the planet and survival on a world whose temperatures range between -200 and 200 degrees.I read it when it came out. My paperback copy is almost used up. Easily one of my favorite SF books of the past forty five years."},{"Title":"The World Is Round","review":"I recently re-read this book after having originally read it in the early 1980s. My memory of it was as one of the best SF novels that I'd ever read, but it didn't hold up that well on re-reading. There are many enormous holes in the plot, and the plot is really just a way to deliver a few \\"shockers\\" about the main character (the giant planet). Still, the writing is quite above average for hard SF, and there are a lot of original hard SF ideas in here.

Andre-Louis gives up his sword fighting to become an undercover political assassin! It's an excellent sequel to Scaramouche!"},{"Title":"Scaramouche the king-maker","review":"The sequel to Scaramouche, this is a very different novel. Scaramouche was filled with comedy, wit, adventure, sword-play and traditional motivations right out of Dumas---revenge, love, survival, and greed.Scaramouche, the King Maker is its much more dark and cynical cousin. Gone, for the most part, are Andre Louis' unending witty repartee and cutting come-backs. He is now pure Machiavellian schemer who seems to bring the downfall of the powerful as a whim and sends men (mostly scoundrels, but innocents also get caught as collateral damage) to the guillotine simply as a game or test of his skill. Despite being one of the best swordsmen in France, there is not a single duel. He never draws his blade. His mind and capacity to plot and exploit the weaknesses of powerful men is much more powerful.We watch over and over again as he coaxes the wealthy and powerful out onto a limb, while he saws it off behind them with a cynical smile, taking no joy in his success. He has no true motivation, no principles----he does not support any cause, in fact he has contempt for those who benefit from his machinations. He just manipulates and wreaks havoc.Yes, his love for Aline in a primary motivator, but I found his behavior to be disturbing and amoral. I think that might be what Sabatini was looking for. This novel is a condemnation of the French Revolution as well as how power corrupts all it touches. There are no heroes in this novel, really. All are protecting their own interest and whose head will fall into the basket is more a function of timing and which way the wind blows.The King Maker is nowhere near as much fun as Scaramouche. It is sort of like The Unforgiven was to westerns---an adventure of the French Revolution without the romance and myth. Just betrayal, greed, the exercise of power, and the basest of human traits on display. In other words, it is realistic and a more complex and modern novel.("},{"Title":"Scaramouche the king-maker","review":"Poor. Doesn't hold a candle to the original.

Through his exploration of nationalism and catholic history he develops a cogent theory of how the christian attitudes towards Jews were formed. While most study on this topic begins in the 19th century, Mosse is able to link it to a far deeper history and in so doing, greatly improve our understanding of this phenomonon.Any one who wants to understand the Holocaust's progenitors would do well to start with this important text."},{"Title":"Toward the Final Solution: A History of European Racism","review":"This is a very interesting study into the history of racism in modern Europe.

Whilst there, she gained the friendship of a Burmese astrologer, who instructed Ms. Cameron in her craft - a most unusual thing given the insularity of Burmese culture and the belief widely-held by Burmese that westerners, being \\"asleep,\\" could neither learn nor apply the teachings of Burmese astrology (known alternately as 'Mahabote,' or the 'Little Key.')Not only did Ms. Cameron learn Burmese astrology, she practiced it masterfully, she taught it well to a generation of students, and she wrote about it in a superbly clear and engaging fashion. Ms. Cameron's \\"Mahabote: The Little Key\\" is indeed a little book of well under a couple of hundred pages. Published by the American Federation of Astrologers in 1980, long out of print, and much sought after, the possessor of this work holds a treasure in his or her hands . It is a volume that belongs in the library of every professional astrologer, and in the library of those with an avocational or scholarly interest in the disciplines of astrology, South Asian area studies or cultural anthropology.Burmese astrology will come as something of a shock to the astrologer whose education and practice has been wholly within the realms of the western tradition. It will also come as a shock - albeit a somewhat lesser one - to the astrologer practicing in the vedic tradition of 'Jyotisha.'Utilizing the seven planets known in ancient times assigned to seven spatial houses, with no reference whatever to a zodiac of any sort, and emphasizing cycles of seven days, seven years and 108 years, it becomes immediately apparent to the reader of this little book that Mahabote is a system of astrology that evolved in complete (or near complete) isolation, the invention of a cultural enclave.While not providing as detailed a corpus of information as a complete Western or Vedic natal reading, the information provided through the informed contemplation of a subject's Burmese birth-chart is staggering for it's completeness and accuracy.Ms. Cameron's book deals in some detail with horary, or electional astrology as it is practiced in Burma and the employment of remedial measures intended to counteract the action of inauspicious energies present in the subject's chart, two areas of practice emphasized within the Burmese tradition.The later topic, remedial measures, is dealt with in great detail in her later book, \\"Turning the Tables\\" which I also recommend to any serious student.This is an author whose work should be very much more widely read and appreciated. As I have learned over a very short time spent studying \\"Mahabote: The Little Key,\\" to know it is to love it."},{"Title":"Mahabote, the Little Key: A Manual For Burmese Astrology","review":"I found this book among my grandmother's collection of astrology books in the 1990's and have been using it ever since as an adjunct to western interpretations. What struck me when I first began applying the methods of this book were the specifics not found in many of my own astrology books. Charts are constructed differently using this method and is a combination of numerology, planetary placement, and even days of the week. What is great about this book is it packs a lot of information in a succinct manner. Many books go on and on with charts of famous people, a gazillion adjectives to describe one point, but the author, Barbara Cameron, manages to convey the basics of Burmese Astrology so that anyone can understand and apply them. Her understanding of planetary vibrations is phenomenal and I like that she interprets aspects for favorable as well as afflicted planets. With a few clearly demonstrated charts, she shows the reader how to use this method. Unfortunately, the contained chart only includes those born through the year 2000. Even more unfortunate, it is out of print and there are no good online sources that really explain this little known form of astrology. As with any form of personality/destiny delineator, it is ideal to have at ones' disposal a variety of sources with which to create a blue-print or \\"map\\" as a means by which to \\"solve\\" the human puzzle. A luxury for the curious, if you can find a copy, but I would say it is geared more toward professional astrologers who wish to advance their skills."},{"Title":"Love and Friendship","review":"I just finished reading this book which was published forty years ago. I love the book because it is a preternaturally accurate and insightful portrayal of Amherst College as it existed in the mid-1950s. I know because I was a student at Amherst in the class of '57. There are many characters who are instantly identifiable as real people at Amherst, such as James Merrill and the renowned (or infamous) professor Theodore Baird [&quot;Oswald McBane&quot;]. I don't know how enjoyable the book will be for readers without an Amherst connection. But for me, it's wonderful, because I disliked Amherst College as much as many of the novel's major characters do, and as Alison Lurie herself obviously did when she was there, married to an English instructor.

This is a good example of her writing, perhaps not as good as &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; or &quot;Lorin Jones&quot;, but well worth reading.Like most of Ms. Lurie's novels, this one has a great sense of place (New England), characters you can care about and periodic flashes of humour. It's not exactly set in academia (cf. &quot;The War Between the Tates&quot;), but a New England university is at the centre of the novel. The almost mystical relationship betweeen Convers College and its graduates / staff is beautifully evoked, as are some of the petty bitching between its academics. By the end of the novel, I felt I'd been there."},{"Title":"Love and Friendship","review":"Emmy's son Freddy is in nursery school. She falls out of love with her husband. Her husband, Holman Turner, is an instructor at Convers College. Previously Emmy always found herself in Convers or at Convers College in the summer. Members of her family thought of the place as their spiritual home. A Mrs. Rabbage arrives at the house to clean. Houses owned by the college are rented out to the faculty in accordance with rank. Holman and Emmy are able to afford to rent on their own since Emmy has her own investment-derived income. Too, they have two cars. The couple makes a ceremony of the cocktail hour.The Humanities C course at Convers is famous. All incoming instructors are compelled to teach it and freshman are compelled to take it. Holman wants to discover the inner power politics of the course and of his department. He is equipped since he understands the Socratic method. Hum C reminds Emmy of Emerson's \\"Self-Reliance\\". Emmy's family, the Stockwells, are college donors and all of the men of the family attend the school.The climate of Convers has been described as worse than Edinburgh. Holman and Emmy attend a party at the Fenns' house. Julian and Miranda are not ready for their guests. Their children, Charles, Richard, and Katie, have let the cat, Hecate, indoors and she has made a mess. At dinner Holman realizes that both he and Miranda have moved up in terms of social class. Emmy and Miranda become friends and Emmy visits Miranda in order to escape from the talkative Mrs. Rabbage. The old stove at the Fenns' house causes a fire. The college stands to lose money since the house is not properly insured. It is maintained the family is at fault and Julian's rudeness leads to his loss of employment at Convers.Julian Fenn and the others have been told that they are at Convers to deal with ideas. A friend tells Emmy that she has imaginary scruples and guilts that she has picked up from her husband. It is improper, the instructors of Hum C are told, to incite students to take action.The author uses dialogue, other conventional means, and an epistolary device to drive the story. It is droll fare."},{"Title":"Love and Friendship","review":"The title of Alison Lurie's first novel is borrowed from Jane Austen, although Austen spelt it \\"Love and Freindship\\", and this spelling is preserved in most modern editions. Like a number of Lurie's later novels it is set among the academic community and deals with a troubled or failing marriage. The setting is a fictitious New England university, Convers College, based upon Amherst College in Massachusetts, where Lurie herself had taught. (Some of the characters are said to be based upon real individuals, something which might have made Lurie unpopular with her former colleagues. Professor Oswald McBain is said to be a portrait of a well-known academic named Theodore Baird, which might explain why his nickname is \\"McBear\\" and why reference is made to a local hill named \\"Mount Baird\\").The main characters are Holman Turner, a young lecturer in the English department, and his wife Emily. The two are from very different social backgrounds, Holman being from a blue-collar family from Chicago, whereas Emily's family, the Stockwells, are East Coast blue-bloods. (Her father is a wealthy industrialist). Although Holman has, unknown to Emily, been unfaithful to her on a couple of occasions, she has hitherto believed her marriage a happy one, but in Convers she finds herself falling out of love with her husband, who she feels does not treat her as an intellectual equal and who is becoming obsessed with his academic work to the exclusion of his home life. She allows herself to be drawn into an affair with another young academic, Will Thomas from the music department. Two other important characters are Holman's colleague Julian Fenn and his wife Miranda.Some of these characters, and members of their families, were to reappear in Lurie's later novels. We learn that Miranda Fenn's real name is Mary Ann, and she appears as the child Mary Ann Hubbard in \\"Only Children\\" and as Mary Ann Fenn in \\"The Truth about Lorin Jones\\". The heroine of \\"Real People\\", Janet Belle Smith, turns out to be married to Emily's brother, Clark Stockwell. Convers College itself is referred to in \\"The Last Resort\\" as the main male character, Wilkie Walker, is a professor there. Emily and Holman's young son Freddie reappears as an adult in \\"Foreign Affairs\\", where he appears to have inherited his father's academic gifts and both his parents' casual attitude to the marriage vow.In \\"Love and Friendship\\" Lurie displays many of the talents which were to make themselves apparent in her later works, most importantly her talent for satire. Here her main target is the petty feuds and rituals of academic life. Despite his knowledge of and passion for his subject, and his gift for teaching, Julian is unable to obtain tenure at Convers, largely because of personality clashes and a feeling in high places that he is not quite the \\"Convers type\\". Any British readers who feel that Oxford and Cambridge are the world's most eccentric academic institutions should read Lurie's description of the bizarre initiation rites necessary for entry into Holman's fraternity house, or of McBain's great obsession, the all-important \\"Hum C\\" course.Most of the novel is narrated in conventional third person style, but a notable feature is that each chapter ends with a letter from Allen Ingram, Convers' novelist-in-residence, to his friend and gay lover Francis Noyes. (Lurie actually uses the word \\"gay\\", which would suggest that it was in common use in this sense in America during the early sixties, around a decade before it became so in Britain). Neither man participates in any important way in the main plot, but Ingram clearly knows the main characters well, and Lurie uses his sharp, bitchy observations as a way of making ironic comments on those characters.Another strength of this novel is the strong sense of place which Lurie is able to conjure up; most of the story takes place in winter, and there is a powerful atmosphere of a cold, damp, wintry New England. Perhaps the main weakness is characterisation; there are some well-drawn characters, but those are mostly peripheral ones such as Julian and Miranda, Allen Ingram, the autocratic McBain and the melancholy and garrulous cleaning lady Mrs Rabbage. The three participants in the central love-triangle, however, are less memorable; I never, for example, got any sense of why Will was so magnetic that Emily found herself drawn into an affair with him. Lurie was to deal with the topic of \\"adultery in academia\\" more convincingly in some of her later novels, such as \\"Foreign Affairs\\". Overall, however, this is a very good first novel; not Lurie's best, but one which shows clear signs of the fine writer she was to become."},{"Title":"Love and Friendship","review":"I just finished reading this book which was published forty years ago.

As often as not in a car - until it gets warm enough to do it in the open air.) Class distinctions and academic hierarchies are nicely observed.

Not only are all her poems here (over 800), but we get a host of other useful things like introductory essays, an essay by Isaiah Berlin, chronology, notes, and tons of beautiful pictures of the beautiful poet herself.Akhmatova is one of the premier 20th century poets, and it is a shame that her reputation is still only establishing itself among English speaking countries. This volume should help in that regard. However, it must be strongly emphasized that readers who hear Akhmatova only in English are really missing most of the beauty of her poems. Russian poetry is musically beautiful, and this is NOT carried over into the Enlglish, although it must be granted that Hemschemeyer does make some pretty valiant attempts to do just this.So the reason for the four stars is that there is no Russian in this edition. Granted, the size of it would hardly permit it. So I would ask that people complement it with an edition of Akhmatova's poems in the original, and either learn cyrillic or get someone who can read them to read them to you! You will hardly recognize them, they are so beautiful. She is a master of alliteration, assonance and rhyme... all of these being so important to her lyricism.I actually bought this edition, and when I found there was no Russian, I returned it and got Hemschemeyer's &quot;Selected Poems of Anna Akhmatova&quot; instead, which only has 100+ poems but has the Russian on the opposing pages.

She was seen by authorities as a dangerous element, related to the pre-revolutionary order. Somehow, even as her fellow poets - including friend Osip Mandlestam and husband Nikolay Gumilov - were executed, exiled, sent to camps, or fled, she managed to survive - outliving Stalin himself. Her poems range from the early tales of love and unrequitation, to the tormented later works such as Requium - a harrowing dedication to the victoms of Stalinism.

Akhmatova's poems are universally accessible to an English speaking/reading audience. You can jump right into the poetry and bypass the introductory material on Anna but my guess is that after sampling these incredible poems most readers will satisfy at least some of their curiosity about the poet and investigate what Anatoly Naiman and Isaiah Berlin have written about Akhmatova. Furthermore the text supplies numerous pointers to places for more information. But the poetry itself is well worth the money for this text. Like Yeats, Akhmatova draws the reader into a poem's world with an ease and grace which belies the efforts of writing whether the subject is heartbreak, love, travel, nature etc.. Akhmatova's &quot;voice&quot; is not that of a supreme being lecturing on high but rather of one person conversing, confiding, contemplating with another.

The specificity, brutality, the sumptuous tenderness of the Russian language are all but lost in these translations of one of this century's greatest poets. Although you might enjoy what you are reading, given you do not speak Russian- you honestly cannot even BEGIN to touch the greatness of Akhmatova or any other Russian poet by reading it in translation.I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of translating poetry- to me its barbaric. A poem is so brief, it is so immediate and so dependent upon every word- no one should ever touch it. If you want it bad enough, learn Russian. And just so you know, reading Russian poetry in its original form is MORE than worth going through the trouble of learning the language. There is nothing in the world like it- nothing.

I don't think I could ever actually do it since I am quite attached to life in the modern world. But still, I sometimes think that getting away from it all would be worth giving everything up.Also, events over the past few years and the blurring of boundaries between religion and politics has lead me to do some reading on Christian writers who have a progressive (liberal) worldview.Naturally, these two interests lead me right to Thomas Merton. The Seven Story Mountain is the first book of his that I have read and it has inspired me to read much more of his writings. I am not a very religious person and sometimes have a hard time not rolling my eyes at his professions of faith and statements. However, I know that everything he writes comes straight from his heart and that gives an emotional edge that allows readers like me to absorb it instead of skimming over it.Sometime in the next couple of years, after I have read some of Merton's other writings, I am going to reread this book and I think it will have a much more profound impact on me.Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I got this for a friend who wanted it.

He was the son of an itinerant painter, had an upbringing with little or no religious character, was a nondescript student, a rabble rouser.. not even a Catholic.. who at a point in his early manhood left the fast life of New York and knocked on the doors of a Kentucky monastery, to give over his life to austere ascetic contemplation.. and profound internal enrichment. Seven Story Mountain has been compared to the Confessions of Augustine, but these books are of different timber. Merton's is a story told at a personal level, of a spiritual journey in a modern context. It does not try to compete with Augustine's intense intellectual and theological reasoning, preferring to dwell on the challenges and joys of religious life, and more generally the meaning and responsibilities of all lives. You can't read this book without being charmed and blessed by the proximity to this rare bit of humanity and devotion in our very secular and material age."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton was brilliant, skilled at literary criticism, a poet, analytical and creative. His sense of self, however, was a mixture of deep introspection and a measure of self-loathing. His spiritual seeking led him to a short stay with Trappist monks in Kentucky. As a result, he gave up his worldly career and embarked on a journey of spiritual seeking as a brother at the monastery.Merton loved music, women, good food, yet he also had a yearning to be free of the world. He describes the ascetic diet at the abbey--meat is forbidden, even fish not eaten, and the monks do heavy agricultural work on bread, vegetables, cheese, and in the evening, maybe a small dish of applesauce. Despite the hardships, Merton finds that becoming a priest is the most meaningful thing ever to happen to him. This book is his memoir of becoming a priest and his spiritual climb from a self-indulgent youth to a mature man continually on the search for spiritual peace and enlightenment. Thus the title \\"seven storey mountain\\" aptly taken from the mountain of Purgatory in Dante's Divine Comedy--a place of punishment, though temporary, on the way to Heaven.Merton's writing made him so famous he sought a hermitage at the abbey. He never seemed quite comfortable anywhere. His sense of discomfort with himself and his exquisite sensibility to spiritual heights make for fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I have read and reread this book several times, and I always enjoy going back into the first half of the 20th century and taking the journey to faith with Thomas Merton, as he moves from childhood to self-absorbed teen to a dabbler in communism, to writer/intellectual, to searcher, to Catholic, to Trappist monk. What a journey!Merton writes in a clear, matter-of-fact, self-depreciating style that is quite attractive. He makes the reader feel as &quot;if this too, could happen to them&quot;, because Merton himself is portrayed as just a common man - filled with sin and propensity for wrong decision-making, but on the road to God nevertheless.Merton shows us that our religious conversion is more than just a point in time: it is a journey in God.I would especially recommend this book to young adult Catholics and those who were not in the Catholic Church during the pre-Vatican II period. The book goes into a fair amount of detail regarding Merton's experience in that Church, and for this reason, might be of interest to those who have come into the Catholic Church since the mid-1960's."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Today I delivered a gift copy of this book to a widow, \\"Grace\\" whose husband had been my late father's closest childhood friend. A week earlier, Grace had asked: \\"Have you ever read Thomas Merton's SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN? I read it in 1953; and found it very moving. I'd love to find a copy and read it again.\\"When I presented her with a new copy of this edition, I asked if I could read aloud my favorite passage (early in the book) concerning Thomas Merton's \`little brother' John Paul (five years younger) who, like his older brother was a French-born, American citizen.Late in the book Thomas Merton tells us how John Paul was compelled early in WWII to join the Royal Canadian Air Force (and trained right here in Manitoba! John Paul Merton had been flying bombing runs over a real sandy desert on the prairie just outside nearby Camp Shilo, where today's Canadian Artillery Officers still train. My late father was flown at Canadian Army expense each year, late in life, to address the graduating officers at that camp: Small world!)Just before leaving for overseas, John Paul flew to see his older brother Thomas and, not incidentally, be Baptized, and welcomed into the Catholic faith. Then he left for England (and was killed in action the next year, when his RAF bomber went down over the English Channel).His death provides the moving culmination to this book - bringing the reader \`full circle' from the moment (back on page 25) when Thomas Merton introduces us to John Paul. (What follows is the passage that moves me to tears when I read it aloud to a friend.)------\\"One thing I would say about my brother, John Paul: My most vivid memories of him, in our childhood, all fill me with poignant compunction at the thought of my own hard-heartedness, and his natural humility and love.\\"I suppose it's usual for elder brothers, when they are still children, to feel themselves demeaned by the company of a brother, four or five years younger, whom they regard as a baby, and tend to patronize and look down upon.\\"So when Russ and Bill and I (older brothers all) made huts in the woods out of boards and tar paper . . . we severely prohibited John Paul, and Russ' younger brother Tommy and their friends from coming anywhere near us. If they did try to come and get into our hut, or even to look at it, we would chase them away with stones.\\"When I think now about that part of my childhood, the picture I get of my brother John Paul is this: standing in a field a hundred yards away from our hut, is this little perplexed five-year-old kid in short pants and a kind of leather jacket, standing quite still; his arms hanging down at his sides.\\"He is gazing in our direction, afraid to come any nearer on account of the stones, as insulted as he is saddened, and his eyes full of indignation and sorrow. And yet he does not go away. We shout at him to go away, beat it, go home, and wing a couple more rocks in that direction. We tell him to play some other place. He does not move.\\"And there he stands, not sobbing, not crying, but angry and unhappy and offended and tremendously sad. And yet he is fascinated by what we are doing, nailing shingles all over our new hut. And his tremendous desire to be with us and to do what we are doing will not permit him to go away.\\"The law written in his nature tells him he must be with his elder brother and do what he is doing, and he cannot understand why this law of love is being so wildly and unjustly violated in his case.\\"Many times are like that, and in a sense, this terrible situation is the pattern and prototype of all sin: the deliberate and formal will to reject disinterested love for us, for the purely arbitrary reason that we simply do not want it. We \`will' to separate ourselves from that love; we reject it entirely and absolutely, and will not acknowledge it, because it does not please us to be loved . . . \\"[Thomas Merton immediately recalls an astounding event] \\"when our \`gang' tried to antagonize the extremely tough Polish kids who had formed a gang in nearby Little Neck (approaching their headquarters) and \\"from a very safe distance we would challenge them to come out and fight\\" (but) \\"nobody came out - perhaps (that day) there was nobody home.\\"But then came the day, Merton recalls, \\"one cold and rainy afternoon, when we observed that numbers of large and small figures, varying in age from 10 to 16, most of them very brawny\\" gathered outside the Merton home, \\"20 or 25 of them. There were four of us.\\"[hiding inside].\\"The climax of the situation came when Frieda, our German maid, told us that she was very busy with housecleaning and we must all get out of the house immediately. Without listening to our extremely nervous protests, she chased us out the back way . . . we made our way through back yards to the safety of Bill's house\\" [a block away, with a clear view across a field, of the Merton home].\\"And then an extraordinary thing happened. The front door of our house opened. My little brother John Paul came walking down the steps with a certain amount of dignity and calm. He crossed the street (and) walked toward the Little Neck gang. They all turned towards him. He kept on walking and walked right into the middle of them.\\"One or two of them took their hands out of their pockets. John Paul just looked at them, turning his head to one side and then the other. And he walked through the middle of them and no one ever touched him.\\"And so he came to the house where we were. We did not chase him away.\\"-------The book closes with a poem written by Thomas Merton upon learning of his brother's death in the North Sea: \\"I learned that John Paul was severely injured in the crash but managed to keep himself afloat, even tried to support the pilot who was already dead.\\"He was very badly hurt; maybe his neck was broken. He lay in the bottom of the dinghy in delirium. He was terribly thirsty. He kept asking for water. But they didn't have any. It didn't last too long. He had three hours of it and then he died. His companions had more to suffer, and were finally picked up and taken to safety five days later. On the fourth day they had buried John Paul at sea.\\"The chapter concludes with Thomas Merton's poetic requiem for his \\"dear brother\\" asking their Maker to,\\"Take my breath . . .and buy yourself a better death . . .And buy you back to your own landThe silence of Whose tears shall fallLike bells upon your alien tomb.Hear them and come,They call you home.\\"Thomas Merton died 40 years ago (on the 20th anniversary of his book's first publishing) while attending a conference of Eastern and Western monks in Thailand (electrocuted by a faulty table lamp in his Bangkok hotel room).This \\"Fiftieth Anniversary Edition\\" includes a delightful \\"Note to the Reader\\" from William H. Shannon, founding president of the International Thomas Merton Society, who recalls that, from the very first day in print (October 4, 1948) the book was \\"an instant success: Hailed as a modern day version of the \`CONFESSIONS' of St. Augustine, it has continued to sell and sell and sell.\\"As Evelyn Waugh, no easy critic, wrote prophetically: It \\"might well prove to be of permanent interest in the history of religious experience.\\"Buy a copy and see for yourself (I highly recommend this edition).Mark BlackburnWinnipeg Canada"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I am currently reading this book forthe second time. I searched far and wide and finally found it at theHarvard University bookstore in 1993. It was, and still is, worth the effort.

Many times during this book I felt longing creep quietly into the back of my mind, raising the questions that we so often evade - what is the true purpose of our life, and are these brave adventurers the people who alone have fulfilled our calling as human beings? Reading this book is a responsibility, a responsibility to listen to this voice and hear it out, a responsibility to be prepared to have our lives changed by this quiet urging we all hear, but often refuse to listen to. Do not expect to read 'The Seven Storey Mountain' and walk away the same person. You won't."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"After reading Thomas Merton's \\"The Seven Storey Mountain,\\" and being amazed at what I read, I want to set down the reaction I had to this powerful book. Merton's story of his faith, from its virtual nonexistence to conversion and then finding his true vocation deeply touched my spirit and enabled me to reexamine a portion of my spirituality that, like the author's at my age, was severely neglected. I hesitate to say that Merton's personal \\"confessions\\" changed my life, because that phrase is so clich&eacute;. However, as a fellow convert, journeying from uncertainty and darkness to light and joy, I connected on that level with him immediately. The sentiments I share with him are best expressed through his words. I hope to convey some sense of the pervasive effects of faith and love on life, which Merton explored. The masterful unity, coherence, and balance of his words can only come from a life of faith...A question remains: why does Merton's story continue to fascinate and speak to so many after 50 years? The fact that his works remain in print and are available in over 20 languages suggest that it is at least profitable to keep them on bookstore shelves and inventories....Merton's works are not dated, but continue to affect millions. They are classics, even when viewed on a purely economic scale, discounting substance and material. Robert Giroux, a personal friend of Merton, quotes Mark Van Doren, an influential professor in his and Merton's life, in his introduction to \\"The Seven Storey Mountain:\\" \\"A classic is a book that remains in print\\" (xviii). I agree with [a reviewer] to an extent when he skeptically questions, \\"But I doubt that any of us would have heard of him or his writings if he hadn't become a monk. As a lay writer, he would have been forgotten long ago.\\" Robert Giroux addresses this quandary in the introduction: \\"Why did the success of the Mountain go so far beyond my expectations as an editor and publisher?\\" (xvi). The spiritual yearning and search for peace in a nuclear age and cold war, where small children in innocence were taught to duck under their desks in case of an attack, certainly plays a role, as Giroux notes. But, \\"Merton's story was unusual - a well-educated and articulate young man withdraws - why? - into a monastery\\" (xvi). Why indeed would a man deny a lucrative career as professor, writer, and intellectual to perform continual penance in an isolated abbey? This intriguing question and unique situation provides the initial draw to the \\"Mountain.\\" To modern middle-class America, the idea that someone would give up \\"profit and financial security for asceticism and penance seems strange. Perhaps readers were awkwardly convicted by the notion that something more substantial existed than a cold beer and hot shower in order to be happy, and that someone had found this something more. However, after curiosity attracts, Merton holds the reader's attention on his own merits. After the head-turning surprise, arresting the passer by in mid stride, he must or, as so many carnival attractions, rapidly relinquish their hold as soon as it is established. Merton's belief he places in the Church is humbling, and provides a draw much stronger than gaudy language or verbal theatrics, even if the reader does not agree with his philosophies. The passion he displays in his words and the yearning for spiritual union with God is so plain in his heart that he propels the reader like the promise of an oasis drives a nomad through endless deserts. Merton gives his reader, a fellow spiritual pilgrim, whether they know it or not, a clear draught to refresh and fortify. And, as Merton ends his story and takes leave, he offers a final piece of advice: \\"Sit finis libri, non finis quaerendi - Let this be the end of the book, but not the end of the search\\" (462)."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The Seven Storey Mountain is by no means Thomas Merton's Masterpiece. But it is his most well-known work. Many people only know Merton for this, the biography of his early years. This can lead people to an uneven view of Merton and his worldview. A good antidote to this particular problem is to read either Merton's Journals or his Letters. They give a much broader view of Merton's developing thought.Yet this book is not without its charms. How all the subsequent efforts of his biographers, no one has told the story of this period of Merton's life better than Merton. There are indispensable insights, biographical as well as spiritual, to be gained from this book. It is still probably the best place to start with Merton. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"It has been a couple of years since I read this autobiography. From the perspective of an always aspiring writer and poet, I applaud this piece of literature for capturing the interest of even the most adamant unbeliever or un-anchored agnostic simply for the raw and accessible story which it conveys. From the stand-point of a spiritual seeker, a self-censoring #4 on the Enneagram (read \\"Merton: An Enneagram Profile\\", by Suzanne Zuercher), and a religious tolerant (which Merton certainly became in his later life), I connected with it instantly on a very intimate level.I can honestly credit Merton for inspiring me to investigate Christianity much more deeply without the usual repugnance and negative bias I had approached it with before, and he has since become one of my favorite writers, artists, thinkers, and Christians... period!Merton was a very \\"human\\" being. His struggles with pride, ego, Biblical understanding, lust, vanity, etc. may help the spiritually inclined reader to accept his or her own flaws in a more forgiving light. He reminds us that nobody is perfect.I highly recommend this book to both the fan of compelling autobiography, and to the aspiring contemplative."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"\\"We are called to create a better world. But we are first of all called to a more immediate and exalted task: that of creating our own lives.\\"Thomas MertonHe was a Trappist monk who for twenty-seven years, between 1941 and 1968, rarely stepped outside of the rural monastery in which he lived. So what could such a person possibly teach us about ourselves? As it turns out, a whole lot. From the opening paragraph of his autobiography:\\"On the last day of January 1915, under the sign of the Water Bearer, in the year of a great war and down in the shadow of some French mountains on the borders of Spain, I came into the world. Free by nature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness, in the image of the world into which I was born. That world was the picture of Hell, full of men like myself, loving God and yet hating Him; born to love Him, living instead in fear and hopeless self-contradictory hungers.\\"The oldest of two sons of an American mother and a father from New Zealand, both of his parents would be dead by his sixteenth birthday and his life and education would be financed by his maternal grandfather, a successful American businessman. After a disastrous year at Cambridge in England, where his excessive consumption of alcohol and sex resulted in a poor academic performance, he was sent back to America to finish his studies at Columbia University in New York City. After a brief flirtation with radical politics and the American Communist Party, he found himself drawn to the writings of several Catholic writers and philosophers. Responding to the world of 1939, a world which seemed to be headed toward utter destruction and chaos, he had an almost unexplainable desire to convert to Catholicism - but more than that - he wanted to become a priest. On November 16, 1938, he was baptized a catholic.On December 10, 1941, three days after America declared war on Japan, he entered the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemane outside of Louisville, Kentucky. He became a Trappist Monk.\\"I rang the bell at the gate....the window opened, and Brother Matthew looked out between the bars...'Hello, Brother', I said.He recognized me, glanced at the suitcase and said: 'This time have you come to stay?''Yes, brother, if you'll pray for me', I said.'That's what I've been doing,\\" he said, \\"praying for you'....So Brother Matthew locked the gate behind me and I was enclosed in the four walls of my new freedom.\\"In 1948, he was encouraged by the Abbot of the monastery to write his memoirs. Incredibly, the resulting effort, The Seven Storey Mountain, turned out to be one of the best selling books of the year. As Merton had been inspired by the events of the prewar world to enter a life of contemplation, so were thousands of people of all faiths inspired by the events of the post war world to question the very tenets of the so-called \\"American Century.\\" Tom Merton not only planted the seeds that would eventually bear the fruit of what would evolve into the anti-war movement, he spoke out against racism at a time when most people didn't even know the definition of the word. From Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander:\\"Blaming the Negro: this is not just a matter of rationalizing and verbalizing. It has become a strong emotional need of the white man. Blaming the Negro...gives the white a stronger sense of identity, or rather it protects an identity which is seriously threatened with pathological dissolution. It is by blaming the Negro that the white man tries to hold himself together...The Negro could really wreak havoc in white society by psychological warfare if he knew how to use it. Already the psychological weapon of nonviolence has proved effective as an attack on the white man's trumped-up image of himself as a righteous and Christian being.\\"He was vehemently anti-war even in times of relative peace. It should come as a surprise to no one that, like all voices of reason and sanity in the era in which he lived, he had a file in J. Edgar Hoover's FBI.

In the autumn of 1968 he was invited to attend a conference of monks and nuns in Bangkok. It was here, on December 10, 1968, within an hour of having addressed the group, that his life ended in the room in which he was staying. He was electrocuted after touching a stand-up fan that had faulty wiring. He was fifty-three years old.There is no question that in the year of 2011, over forty years after his untimely death, Thomas Merton still matters. He reaches out to us across the decades, an articulate and passionate advocate of Peace and Love and Silence. It was his prayerful belief that only by obliterating the noise of our lives - whether it be the electronic noise of our immediate surroundings or the noise of our minds - could we achieve a pure communion with God.It would be nice if he were still here.

It tells of a journey from early childhood through final orders at Gesthemene that includes the reader every step of the way and points the way with great practicality and simplicity. To see the opening of his world to the Creator beyond and within has made a difference in my life and my reading. His continuing story, \\"The Sign of Jonas\\", also left me with wonder at the man's love and intelligence and great faith. My little Merton library keeps growning as other gems turn up; including \\"Encountering Merton\\" by another spiritual author, Henri Nouwen. It must be said; I found \\"Seven Storey Mountain\\" to be a threshold book."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This was my first real &quot;conversion story&quot; that I've read, and I'm sure it will be one of the best I'll ever read. After spending many years in the darkness of sin, Thomas converted to Catholicism and ultimately, a Trappist monastery. His story was really inspirational, and has nurtured my possible vocation to the Trappist life. This book would be a great read for ALL kinds of people: senior citizens, atheists, Catholics, and Protestants."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Seekers of spiritual truth won't find a more engrossing book. From self-proclaimed &quot;atheist&quot; to Trappist monk, Merton covered a fascinating time in Europe and America in his autobiography. His erudition and his conversion to Catholicism are unparalleled in journal writing. Worth reading, no matter what your religion is, but especially relevant to Catholics, who will understand the deep mysteries that beckoned to Merton during his storied life. If you're at the right stage in your life as a seeker, this book could change your life."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is a great book for the first time Merton reader. The complete context of a life fought out on the spiritual plane, replete with stunning lapses into the secular world, permeate this book.We learn of Merton's early life, his father the painter, his mother the reticent matron who is not overly convinced of the devoutness of his devotion, who at times fears and does not understand him.Their idyllic existence in France, spotted by the failed relationship of his grandparents, who suffer each other like a crown of thorns, serves to move him away from family into the arms of intellectual pursuits atEastern universities, where he does and does not fit in, depending upon his spiritual mood. He flails about the rectory of faith like a large mouth bass on a ten pound test line. Straining mightily torward the trappings ofintellectual success, only to find it vague and empty. Fullness for Merton hinges on the rightness of faith within the mighty structure (and constricture) of the Catholic Church. Protestantism leaves him weak and he feels no righteousness in it.Only when conversing with the hierarchy of saints or humming tunes to the Divine Mother does he find the certainty he so desperately seeks. It is a courageous attempt of one man to lay bare the struggle of his spiritual life. A struggle he chooses to resolve incloister, surrounded by what passes for religious structure. His brother's unexpected conversion to Catholicism and resultant death in a war Merton seeks to avoid serves to deepen his faith and devotion to the Catholic system. Merton's honesty in hiswriting is refreshing and smacks of truth. If one looks past his obvious prejudice that salvation in its purest form only lies within the Catholic framework, the book becomes a fascinating document of one man's difficult journey navigating through life's mysteries to arrive atconclusions he believes pleasing to God and himself: life as a Trappist monk. Merton has done his job well and this writing deserves a discerning look for the most part. A good autobiographical read, deeply reflective and sincere. Worth the effort, even if it falls a littleshort in some lengthy sections devoted to secular, biographical observations which do not really add to the depth of understanding Merton's battles within himself."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton is a profound person, and his personal story reflects his wisdom and keen sense of what is important in life. The book itself is surprisingly easy to read, though at times it seems to contain more detail than I hoped for, particularly in the latter parts of the book. As a non-Catholic, I was not reading this book for specific religious doctrine, but rather as a study of the nature of intensely devoted religious people. I got my money and time's worth."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"If you feel yourself flagging in your Catholic faith, or if you are considering converting to Catholicism, read this book! I converted a year ago, and this book helped me understand more truths about my faith."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"\\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is that rarest of gems: an articulate book about a lifelong spiritual quest.Its author, Thomas Merton, tells the story of his life, how his vague unease about spiritual questions eventually led him not only to Catholicism but to the narrow walls of a Trappist monastery in Kentucky.The writing is rich and thoughtful. Whatever your opinion of Merton's conclusions, you find yourself admiring his bravery and honesty.Surprisingly, the book is actually quite the multi-textured rumination on life in America in mid-century as much as it is the story of Merton's life. His gallery of characters and evocative prose never disappoint. Here's a sample:\\"It was a bright, icy-cold afternoon when, having passed Nantucket Light, we first saw the long, low, yellow shoreline of Long Island shining palely in the December sun. But when we entered New York harbor the lights were already coming on, glittering like jewels in the hard, clear buildings. The great, debonair city that was both young and old, and wise and innocent, shouted in the winter night as we passed the Battery and started up the North River. And I was glad, very glad to be an immigrant once again.\\" (p. 151)I would recommend \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" to anybody who finds himself restless about spiritual matters, even if he has no particular interest in Catholicism or even Christianity. The book's reach is much deeper than that."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Only commenting on the audio CD version of SSM. It needs an Unabridged version. This version has been shortened considerably. Also, there should be price consistant with the printed version. CD media is very inexpensive to produce. With an abridged version of the book, I would have expected a better price."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"THE SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN is an honest book. The author does not seem to conceal much about his relationships with his friends, parents, grandparents and brother or his life as a monk.His spiritual climb from being totally immersed in the world as an academic to his entry into the Trappist Monastery at Gethsemany is portrayed as a torturous struggle.As the book ends the reader gets the impression that many more such battles are still in store for Merton.When setting out to read books by this author, I recommend beginning with THE SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN. It will leave you with a desire to read more about Merton's pilgrimage as reflected in his later works."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The Seven Storey Mountain is a true classic written by a humble genius. It is extremely well written and laid out. Thomas Merton being a highly intelligent man wrote it is a highly intelligent manner, and you can not help but sink into his wonderful narrative style and logical manner. It was written over half a century though and I at times had to reread sections because his writing style and use of words was not very familiar to me, and I wanted to insure I was understanding what he was saying.What really sets the Seven Storey Mountain apart is it gets better after reading it. It is often times in the years after my first read where idea and seeds that were planted when I first read the novel make themselves known. Thomas' search and discovery for religion and purpose will appeal to a wide audience, not just the uber religious. It is a wonderful novel of self discovery and change."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Thomas Merton. It actually reads like a great novel, which makes it even more fascinating that it is an autobiography. Merton is often appreciated for his contemplative works. I would not necessarily consider The Seven Storey Mountain a contemplative book, but it definitely belongs in the canon of Western mystical literature. It can provide a great doorway into deeper and more spiritual works. Topics such as monasticism become absolutely intriguing after reading this book. Be warned that this book could cause you to embark on a great spiritual journey!"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"If you read Seven Storey Mountain, you were probably meant to read it. One of the customer/reviewers said &quot;I doubt that any of us would have heard of him or his writings if he hadn't become a monk. As a lay writer, he would have been forgotten long ago.&quot; That's true, I'm sure. But thanks to the Holy Spirit, Thomas Merton became a Trappist Monk, wrote this and other spiritual works and now many are brought to God through his writings. The book doesn't have to be &quot;great literature&quot; to get across a good message. I don't think Merton was setting out to write a literary masterpiece and the book should not be judged as such. It should be judged as the story of a man's life. As for Merton's spiritual dabblings... why does the scope of his journey make his journey any less valid? We are all searching - should we search on only one road? If you don't want to read this book, fine. If you do want to read this book it's because you are meant to."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Sometimes you have to endure a lot of pain for a few ounces of pleasure. I picked up TSSM upon a friend's recommendation, and after he had read me a few incredibly insightful quotes from the book. In addition, I am a huge fan of Brennan Manning, who quotes Merton quite often in books like &quot;The Ragamuffin Gospel&quot; and &quot;The Signature of Jesus,&quot; which further whet my appetite to read TSSM. What I found was a man who is incredibly complex in his dogmatism, who began a project, the proportions of which he may have found greater than will the reader.The events of his life, from birth to the day the ink dried on the manuscript, may prove to be too wordy for many people; however, it would be a shame to let Merton's droning on about seemingly insignificant events discourage the reader from reaching the final 50 pages. I wished there were a condensed version, because his style is not conducive to such minutia as what he ate at such and such meal. Details like that really bog down this autobiography. I mean, come on, I thought he should have been a bit more selective about which items to omit from this book.To be fair, looking at my copy next to me on the desk, I see about 40-50 dog-eared pages interspersed throughout the book, marking sentiments ranging from the empty spirituality of the Anglican church, the futility of life without God, communism, the prison of consumerism. Some of his words, written 50 years ago, are chillingly prophetic. For example, &quot;Is it any wonder that there can be no peace in a world where everything possible is done to guarantee that the youth of every nation will grow up absolutely without moral and religious discipline, and without the shadow of an interior life, or of that spirituality and charity and faith which alone can safeguard the treaties and agreements made by governments?&quot;I realize this book was written under a strict editor's pen (his abbot), so much detail about his sinful past was struck from the final manuscript. Such details are important when trying to understand the nature of Merton's self assessment. Why did he feel so remorseful about specific situations? He talks about his remorse, but does not address the specifics of his sin that is causing a chasm between him and God.As a detestable Protestant (nearly paraphrasing Merton), this book had me both cheering and squirming uncomfortably at some of Merton's statements. The most distressing point was his statement (I'm paraphrasing) &quot;the Catholic Church is the only institution that has presented an unchanging, cohesive theology over the centuries.&quot; A few pages later, he is ripping off a long prayer to Mary, hailing her as the Mother of all Life, the Mother of God, which is a doctrine that the Catholic Church adopted in the 8th century. I would not consider that &quot;unchanging and cohesive,&quot; not to mention the changes from Vatican I to Vatican II. Being a Protestant, I found his veneration of Mary foreign and uncomfortable, and maybe a substitute for the intercessor Jesus promised, the Holy Spirit. I found way too much Mary and not enough Jesus or Holy Spirit. Of course, I was not the targeted audience, so my personal offense is immaterial.However, I found many gems in Merton's writings and am not willing to throw this baby out with the bath water of his near militant Catholicism. The man was a genius, there is no doubt in my mind, and TSSM is filled with paragraphs that should be posted on the walls of our institutions, to at least get people to stop and think about the direction in which they are being driven. I found it a bit wordy and a bit too militaristic to afford it 5 stars, but many will find it well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The Seven Storey Mountain was a book suggested to me by my father when I was a teenager. I ignored his advice 20 years ago and I found myself comming back to this work only now that I am married with two children. I am glad that I did not read the book at 17 I was too young to fully understand it because I did not have enough life experiences to recognize the value in Merton's points. You definately need some scars and experience to take this book to heart.One other thing you have to keep in mind always while reading this book is the fact that it was written before the second Vatican Council. I am making this point because Merton's descriptions and characterizations of Protestants can be read as harsh in the more ecumenical world we live in today. I am a life long catholic and found some passages and referneces set me back. If the emnity between religions was consistent with these comments, then I am happier to be living today than then.The last thing is that this is a long, long, long book. You have to work your way through several hundred pages before it all comes together. The labor is work the effort as the last 100 or so pages are some of the most emotive and spritual words I have read. This effect would be lost entirely if you do not read the whole book. So the advice is to set your mind to reading the whole thing knowing that there is a reward at the end. In that way, the book is a metaphor for the spirtual life.If you are a teeenager I recommend a book called &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot;. A good book on religion and being a teen that I did read when I was a teenager. Although its set in the 1960-70's its still topical."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"If I could have only one spriritual book outside the bible, this is THE one! Merton put spirituality in terms I could not only understand, but could actually relate to. I was captivated by his expression of faith that transformed my understanding of christianity from the abstract to the &quot;metaphysical&quot;. This spiritual journey touched my soul in a way that no other book has. The wisdom encountered in this work is timeless, relevant, and more important to modern humanity than at any other time before. My relationship to my God [and indeed my entrance into the Catholic church] is, in part, due to this extraordinary opus. ad mejorem dei gloriam!!"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book, which was central in my own conversion to the Roman Catholic Church, is written in the easy-going style of a &quot;regular guy&quot;. Merton shows that one need not be a saint to enter religious life in a monastery: one only needs to be open to hearing the voice of the Lord and to following His will. I would strongly recommend this book - especially to individuals interested in entering the Catholic Church or to individuals contemplating religious life."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"OK, I enjoyed reading this book very much. Being a protestant follower of Christ, this book has enlightened me to some of the processes of Catholicism and I've enjoyed that very much. I don't know if I believe Thomas really had a handle on his \\"holiness\\". I get the impression that Thomas believed the only way to live for Christ and make it to Heaven was to be a Catholic. For all his love of God, I find it hard to understand Thomas's discrimination of Protestants. Being a follower of Christ has nothing to do with what church you go to, what race you are, what class, etc. Even the forward tries to justify Thomas's misgivings and immoralities by blaming those on \\"the time\\" it was written. I also believe that Kentucky has some the most beautiful country settings on earth but the idea of followers of Christ hiding in the woods in a monastery is God's design for man is bipolar theology. Jesus said 'go unto the nations and make disciples of men\\"... remember what Jesus did? Fishers of men. And as for the beautiful monasteries and cathedrals and churches..they don't mean anything to God. Build rather the ART of your soul, a beautiful temple to hold the art of your spirit in Christ. Thomas LOVED big words and Latin phrases - kind of a contradiction to the SIMPLE life of the people and saints he wrote about. So, why do I love this book? Well, its the first 500 page book I've gotten through in awhile. Also, it has caused me to dig deeper in my own soul and to extend my contemplation and prayer and in general, love and grow in Christ. For me, that was well worth the trip and do encourage others to read this book."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Beyond all that so many have written in light of Merton's conversion story vis-a-vis their own, Thomas' subtle contextualization of his inspiration of image for The Seven Storey Mountain coming from Dante's seven-terraced Mount Purgatory contained within The Divine Comedy magnum opus has the potentiality of affirming and enlightening those seeking integration of literary and spiritual works. The cover art of this particular Harvest edition (1978) is illustrative of that rudimentary element."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"While memoirs and autobiographical works can be less-than-pleasing at times, this book rises to the top of pile to shine for more than fifty years. I cannot say enough good things about this book. Thomas Merton has inspired so many, myself included, over the decades with his social, political, spiritual and theological insight and wisdom that I only wish that you can also experience it too.The Seven Storey Mountain takes you on a journey into, not only the life, but the mind of Merton. It is a story that touches the hearts of many because it can be related to on one level or another.

In this autobiography Thomas Merton chronicles his early life and his struggles with the flaws of his character, and his growing vocation to be a Trappist monk.Merton seems to have followed a common pattern of the era - childhood religious influence, teenage and college years spent in intellectual atheism and dissipation, then a return to an ardent faith. He gives a very good sense of the spiritual atmosphere of the various stages of his life, and has a fine insight into the journey of spiritual growth. He seems to be modelling his narrative on that of Augustine's Confessions - the brilliant but depraved young man who hears God's call and surrenders to the lure of true spiritual beauty. But with all due respect to Merton, he was neither as brilliant nor as depraved as Augustine, and his story is affecting not because of its drama but because of its ordinariness, a man who grew gradually to accept the demands of the spiritual world and to experience the grace of God.The setting of pre-Vatican II Catholicism as the context for his faith is very well evoked, and the power of the sacraments and devotion to the Virgin Mary are constant themes, as well as Thomistic theology. This is different to the later works of Merton, who grew more deeply into his contemplative knowledge, but it remains a great picture of a man happy in his new vocation and conscious of the constant presence of God throughout his life."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is one of the most wonderful Stories to conversion and faith.

Merton is a prophet,e.g., spoke out about the evil of nuclear proliferation long before the topic was given the notice it should have. Up there in years, sge 90 to be exact, I enthusiastically encourage readers to discover this well-written book. It is reading for all, especially young people to profit by.

I think that the reader would find it a part of its charm (if that is the word)."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"If I am of any religion, I am probably a confused blend of Taoist and Hindu -- thus has Fate conspired to mix me up. However, I don't find that there is anything in Merton's SSM which does not speak across incredible gulfs of difference. Any serious religion is the search for transcendent truth, and Merton's quest is a compelling, beautiful account of an individual's journey along that path. I don't care much at all whether or not he is a great philosopher; I would be willing to pay far more attention to someone who seeks to experience and to know of God directly than I would to listen to the too-many theoretical-philosophical works of a remote and mediocre nature, whose authors cerebrate what they can not feel. There are few great philosophers who can touch us, and Merton may not be one of them. But when I read what he has left for the world, I can't help but feel that I have felt the profound influence of a great MAN, and there aren't too many of those around these days, either."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton was an educated and talented young man who could have gone on to become anything he wanted, especially a secular author which is where he was headed in his early twenties. But a rootless life had left him hungry for more and after a conversion to Catholicism, Merton felt destined to the priesthood and eventually entered a Trappist monastery with the surest of convictions that he was following his calling. Yet his remarkable ability to capture thoughts and devotions in poetry and prose kept his pen active and helped him to bring his thoughts and his faith to a worldwide audience. \\"The Seven Storey Mountain: An Autobiography of Faith\\" is Merton's account of his life growing up through his conversion. It is a relatively open and honest look at a remarkable life and an incredible faith that was cut tragically short in 1968.Merton, as the son of an itinerant painter, spent much of his early years traveling with his father to various countries, especially after the death of his mother, where his education was rather piecemeal at best. His recollections of his childhood and these voyages are filled with a child's wonder and remarkable detail. He began his college career at Cambridge, but was forced to begin anew at Columbia College in New York because of some trouble he had gotten himself into and because he had been essentially disowned by his godfather, his own father having passed away recently. This may be one criticism of Merton's autobiography, since those unfamiliar with his life will not know exactly what he left out. Indeed, this is a somewhat sanitized version of Merton's life, but that does not distract from Merton's overall message or aim.After wandering about after graduation, teaching English, writing articles and reviews and novels, and generally looking for some way to fill the void in his life, Merton converted to Catholicism. The sheer joy and calm that he experienced at this conversion is shared by the reader, as Merton lays bare his doubts and fears about his newfound faith and his possible vocation. Just when things seem bleak for Merton, when his past comes back to haunt him, his vocation is fulfilled and he enters the Trappist monastery Gethsemani in Kentucky, and the final portion of the book is devoted to his new life as a monk and what it means to lead a contemplative life.\\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is a compelling read. While it is not overly long, it may take readers a while to read since one takes part in Merton's many contemplations along the way. Intermixed with his memories are Merton's thoughts about various issues and how faith can provide an answer in any situation. Merton's writing is evidence of his talent - his prose is often lyrical and poetic, his contemplations are prayers. It is easy to see why\\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" has become one of the most influential religious works of the past century. Merton's life will touch a chord with readers from any background, maybe because his story seems so unlikely, but more so because of how his experiences are those shared by everyone."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"\\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is a coming of age story in much the same vein as \\"Catcher in the Rye' but with a tone in the complete opposite direction. A man begins his life on one continent with little knowledge of the Christian faith only to spend most of the rest of his life on another continent taking the strictest vows available in the Catholic church. Thomas Merton's unlikely story is an amazing journey.The initial chapters of the book which involve Merton's early life tend to move a little slow. Yet when the early chapters are placed in the landscape of the time period, it gives Merton's experience a great sense of authenticity. Throughout the book, Merton is searching for something to define his life. While falling to youthful inhibitions such as alcohol and smoking, Merton lives the American college life. Yet even as he masters the English language, he feels a lack of direction. And even before he spent significant time in the Catholic faith, he felt a calling to the religious life. It was a stuggle, though anything of value is worth struggling to attain.Gaps in this story may cause some confusion in readers. Merton chose to omit his fathering of a child which may have been wise in the social landscape into which the book was released. The paternity was only mentioned in vague terms. The way in which he mentions it seems to just imply that he was uncertain of his vocation.Merton is a masterful storyteller and readers should find great enjoyment in this book. The chapters are fast paced and even run parallel to an American historical perspective. In the context of Merton's writings, this may be the most significant one and should be read by all those interested in Merton's writings."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"A true classic in Christian literature. The man was truly a saint and a sinner who knew his need of forgiveness. His life was shaped by many early experiences and he shares them openly in this extremely well-crafted autobiography. Deeply encouraging and inspiring, it left me wanting to read everything he ever wrote. A passionate, sensitive, and powerful autobiography."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Just about anyone interested in purchasing this book is more than likely somewhat familiar with some of Merton's other works. He was perhaps the 20th century's greatest Christian contemplative mind we had the privilege of reading. This is due to the fact that so many people have expressed over the years that Thomas Merton is the reason they were drawn to the Christian faith. Even people of other religions respect this man's skilled and wise approach to otherwise dogmatic dialogues. One of the reason's this autobiography is so wonderful, is that most of us can relate to it's contents. This is not a person who just achieved some sort of \\"holy lifestyle\\" without going through some tribulations in his earlier years.What draws one to Thomas Merton is his simplistic writing. In this book we find out what causes produced the effect of wanting to join the Abbey of Gethsemani down in Kentucky for him. From his years growing up in France, then on to England. Back to new York. And then, he found his home. That home was the Abbey of Gethsemani. Merton is able to bring people closer to Jesus, because he makes the story alive. Relevant to this very life in a modern era, not just a society that we are all too disconnected from by now (the society during the times of Jesus). This book is so applicable to 2004, not withstanding the fact that there are a great many of his years not documented in this work stemming from it's publication to his Death in Thailand.Recalling a sad time soon after his acceptance of Christianity, Merton quotes God's caution to the Israelites, &quot;For the Land which thou goest to possess is not like the land of Egypt,&quot; and remarks that he had &quot;made the terrible mistake of entering the Christian life as if it were merely the natural life invested with a kind of supernatural mode by grace.&quot; He slowly and nervously was to learn God was dreadfully more than some mere underwriter of value. In this book Merton shows a hungriness, a drive to understand the meaning of life. The secret to living a completely holy life, immersed in servitude to our Creator. This hungriness we can all relate to, it is the drive to understand truth."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I read a lot, but there are few books I return to for a second or third reading. Merton's spiritual autobiography is one of them. His story is engaging and well-written, and you will likely see yourself more than once in his unfolding search. I have given this book to friends as a gift, and I highly recommend it. My suggestion would be to use it as an introduction to Merton's journals and other writings."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I'm not a Catholic and knew nothing of Thomas Merton, but came across this book by following links of \\"customers who bought this, also bought...\\" and by reading Amazon reviews. I was not disappointed. Reading like a novel at times, this book is an autobiography of a faith. I was very impressed with the author's search for a faith, his many trials and searches in the wrong place, and his determination to find somthing \\"bigger than himself.\\" This book written over 50 years ago is dated in ways by theology and politics that seem out of place now; however, the overall impact of Merton's search is well worth the effort to read. This book is for someone who is searching for a deep quiet faith -- one that is found through searching, reading, praying and worshiping quietly and individually.This book is not in the same category of many popular Christian writings of this time. Thomas Merton's faith is one that was found in an ancient church and many ancient writings. It was a faith found through traditional liturgy and reading. I don't think Merton would have been comfortable in many of the modern churches (both Protestant or Catholic) that attempt to mold worship to meet cultural demands.Thanks to all the reviewers who so aptly described this book and caused me to want to read it. I hope others will find it equally as inspiring."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Upon reading the spiritual autobiography of Thomas Merton, the immediate details of his life that boldly jutted out and painted the overall portrait of the man was his controlled yet cyclonic whirlwind of pell-mell inconsistency and the overall amorphousness of his ever evolving life up into manhood.Thomas Merton's life seemed to be the never-ending quest for the ultimate truth, and there were many byways that he chose in order to obtain that: literature, academia, writing, traveling, communism, rollicking around with friends and girlfriends in playful mirth, all the way down the gamut. The veneer that he presents, as illustrated in the autobiography, seemed to be one of gradual and acute worldly dissatisfaction, a man who had an internal \\"been there done that\\" mentality and who could never be really satiated, despite his intellectual and Herculean efforts. And Merton was, no doubt about it, a brilliant man, but he never seemed to have the appropriate venue for all that he was eternally endowed with. Though he was young and had so much going for him in a manner realtional to the world, it could not soothe the cut of his injured relationship to the outer world in which he occupied. It was as though he was a reluctant participator in a mysterious game where Love was the backdrop, and his inner tumultuousness gradually conformed to the Will, and it is the latter aspect that makes the story so fasciniting, because it encompasses the supernatural, the pragmatic, the logical, the Divine, all meshed together in a ball of wax.What makes the Seven Storey Mountain so gripping is that the reader follows Thomas Merton through his various escapades of self-absorption down to his conversion and then on down to his monastic vocation. But with each step, the discernment process is intricately exposed in all its minute details, as well as its various joys and sufferings. He was a man who could write beautiful English yet could never get published. He was a man who was philosophically deep yet could not really apply that depth to anything concrete. He was passionate in his seriousness yet that made him somewhat of an outsider, but it was not until he stopped fighting God that things started to happen, and he saw the Divine tests for exactly what they were: Gifts. But it takes a long time to come to that understanding and it is not always easily accepted. Like Merton, one just has to run him or herself ragged with fighting the duality of the internal and external to come to that point, and the autobiography makes it known that it is not always a joy to have to hit the basest level of yourself to understand what you really are.Overall, the work was quite nice to read, if not a tad bit preachy at times and other times overly sanctimonious, but again, that can be attributed to the newness of Merton's calling, for he entered Gethsemani in 1942, and the partially approved text of the Seven Storey Mountain was approved in 1946, finally being published in 1948. But I thought it was a moving read that did affect my senses, and it will yours as well."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This mystic speaks with the sincerity of a saint and the pen of a poet. Every page - and there are many of them - is delight to read, and feels, somehow, like they are the memories of the reader, not just Merton's.It's important to remember, however, that Merton disowned this book later in his live. He said it was not &quot;disciplined enough&quot; or something like that. I would only object to his rigid stances of Catholicism in relation to other Christians. I too believe in &quot;one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church&quot;. However, it is this believe that compells me to approach the multitude of Protestant churches with compassion and not condemnation, which unfortunately Merton sometimes does. Perhaps this is why he felt he had to disown it.Either way, it is a beautiful book, a spirtual book, and a wonderful conversion story of the rare type of person who actually and legitatmely managed to find peace in this life."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book is a modern masterpiece-- often compared to St. Augustine's Confessions.

It is so beautiful I finished readingit word for word from cover to cover in 2 days. I am hooked on Thomas Merton! Looking forward to more of his works."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"As an Eastern Catholic who is in the midst of discerning a call to the monastic life (a very serious call), I thought that reading the written account of Merton's own journey might be helpful. I was not disappointed. More than that, I think that all sophomores in high school should be made to read it, with a mandatory repeat in their senior year.Why?Because Merton so eloquently describes his involvement for the first 30 years of his life in what the Bible speaks of as \\"the vanity of this world.\\" He carefully takes the reader through the journey of an ordinary childhood, his college years, and the inner sense of dissatisfaction he felt with all the things that the world calls \\"important\\". This gnawing sense within his soul led to his eventual conversion to the Catholic Faith. His expressions of joy at his conversion are lovely to read, and, for me, reflect my similar experience in entering our Lord's Church 7 years ago.I think therefore it would be good for young people to read this book on the threshold of their adulthood so that they could see that there is more indeed to life than the pursuit of wealth and fame. They would also read the read conversion of a soul from discontent to peace, from questioning to assurance, from boredom to joy. I think too many people associate the conscrated life with austerity and joylessness. One simply does not get that feeling from Merton's conversion to the Church, and then to the Trappist monastery. If one is truly called to the consecrated life, there is joy in responding to that call, and Merton makes this clear as he writes.Fr. Merton has a wonderful style of writing and, except for a few parts which got a little tedious for me to plow through, I found the book flows well and is easily readable. Merton has sections where he describes in clear detail his thoughts regarding the vanity of the passing world and his attraction to that which is eternal and timeless --the spiritual world. As we know from his later writings, there was a special call on his life which kept him from finding peace and rest within until he responded to it.This is a well written and easy to read story of one man's early life and spiritual journey. Once you pick it up, you will find it hard to put down until you finish it."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Having been a fan of Thomas Merton for years, I purchased 2 copies for 2 friends who were on a conversion journey themselves. Both declared that they were unable to put the book down and found it inspiring.Almost all of us struggle with the pull of material things, physical things, and spiritual things. Merton talks frankly about his struggles and his failures as well as his eventual feelings of the rightness of his decision to choose the spiritual life."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I first read this book in high school, and it is a must for anyone interested in the Roman Catholic spiritual experience. Merton was a convert to Catholicism and later became a Trappist monk. His autobiography was published following WWII. It became a huge best seller and made him internationally famous. By contemporary standards, the book is dated in its post war innocence and preachiness, but still a fantastic read. Why does a man give up everything: sex, money, friendships, education to live as a impoverished medevil monastic. In the 1960s, Merton became a staunch anti-war activist. He died suspiciously in Asia at an international conference on meditation. Some say it was a CIA murder, others a suicide; most likely though an acciental bathtub electrocution. Read his autobiography then his other books and diaries."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I read this book several years ago during a time of great spiritual crisis.

I must admit that I am not Catholic, and never will be, and that I struggle every day with my faith (something Merton could relate to). What I related to most, though, was the fact that this man struggled constantly with issues so terribly neglected in modern times: issues surrounding charity, asceticism, non-violence, and the downside of capitalism. One can cull a tremendous amount of very relevant social criticism from this book, a good sixty years after it was written. I would have to argue, though, that at the point of authorship of Seven Storey, Merton owed only a few of his ideas to the left. He was overwhelmed with an idealistic, Christian/Utopian vision of peace, love and charity. This left him very untied to the outside world, however often he argued that Gethsemani was the &quot;real American.&quot; I have struggled with Christian utopianism for years, quite convinced that it could never work, and at other times believing that it is the only true salvation for humanity. Merton naively believed that the struggles of mankind, as impermanent as they were, might be solved through the sense of humility and charity that the &quot;real&quot; Catholic church brings. It is a huge, impossible dream. And, in escaping to Gesthemani, perhaps he was escaping from the thorny issues that surround such idealism. But, for the most part, he was right on. The rot that was (and is) Western civilization, built layer by layer for centuries, was finally seeing its stinking fruition at the time of his conversion and subsequent vocation in the Catholic church. With American hegemony, in the present time, we have not seen the rot disappear, only to take upon a different mutation. What I believe is the very essence of Christianity: non-violence andcharity, has been replaced by an amorphous and greedy capitalist system that keeps pace with the continuation of a military-industrial complex. Civilization holds on by a thread. In this new century, we continue to avoid peaceful answers. And although he did not have all the best solutions, Merton asked most of the right questions."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"It requires a lot of courage to renounce the world \`in life'; long before we must necessarily do so at our own death. In The Seven Storey Mountain I was expecting to find a man that had indulged in all sensual and societal pleasures only to recognize the futility of earthly life/pleasures, renounce them and submit to a higher \`spiritual' order. I was not disappointed there but then you'd expect a man full of compassion, open-mindedness and humility at the end of such journey; but instead you read about a self-centered man (like any of us) that does not open fully to all of life but simply submits to the approved world-views prescribed by the Catholic Church.What I found most disappointing about the book is Merton's narrow views on any non-Catholic form of life. The book is contaminated with disdainful judgments on all those that do not share the views of the Catholic Church (particularly Protestants, but also Buddhism and pre-Columbian Mayans). This attitude of Merton's makes his conversion and subsequent retreat to a Trappist monastery less of an act of humility and more of a boasting in his having found the only true way to life. Whatever literary or spiritual qualities this autobiography may have, they are often marred by his condemnation of other religious and spiritual orders.The creed of Catholicism that Merton has adopted, with its repudiation of pagans (yes, he writes \`pagans' of those that are non-Christian), makes his Catholicism seem more like a unenlightened sect rather than the \`universal' religion that would recognize all beings and things in this universe as emanating from one same source (call it God, Brahman, Implicate Order, or whatnot).As an agnostic reading an autobiography of faith, I was hoping to find a man of the order of a Swami Vivekananda that would spread a message of understanding and love for all classes and creeds of mankind. Unfortunately he wrote as a Catholic to other Catholics and his experience may not appeal to those of other world-views."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I bought this for a friend, they said the author was insightful and that they were enjoying the book.

Then, when he became more substantive in reflection on his spiritual progress and personalization of faith development, it became clear that the rudimentary seeds that were planted came to fruition. No only was Merton moved by the Holy Spirit, but the others around him were as well, facilitating his expressiveness within the confines of the monastery.I am moved to read more of his writings and try to resonate with his transformation from 'false self to true self.'"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Perhaps the lure of this title is unusual.

How fortunate that I was allowed to witness through this book the spritual journey of such a faith-filled individual. Thomas Merton is one of the extraordinary writers of this century. What a gift he has in revealing so much of himself through his writing, yet it spoke to me of my ownself and my own faith in God. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Without a firm line on Thomas Merton, one may initially wonder why his autobiographical tale possesses more merit than anyone elses. He, like countless others, led a life of profligacy consumed by the demands of self-gratification. He like countless others, afforded the material world far more of himself than it deserved. And, he, like *all* others, did not innately recognize the roots of true happiness. So, how is Thomas Merton different?Well, for starters, he did something about it.How many times have men and women stopped to wonder whether the quest for material gain is all that a life can offer? And how many times have men and women acknowledged the gnawing pit in their stomach with the suspicion that it can't possibly be? More importantly, however, who among us has been courageous enough to do something about it? Merton's journey from profligate young man to a member of the Trappist order cannot be everyone's response to temporal challenge, but it was a natural transition for him and one by which we all can profit.The Seven Storey Mountain is only part autobiography for it is well-supported by spiritual pillars. It is the story of one man's trek to God, but certainly not of one man's temptations. We all face the paradox. We can strive for material gain, we can bend to self-gratification, but in the end we find that the results of such efforts fall short of true contentment. Merton's personal solution speaks volumes to the typical suburban striver and, though it may not vault one towards the monastery, gives the reflective reader reason to pause. It, perhaps, illuminates the daily routine of material gain for what it is: gain for gain's sake. And it may inform us that there is more to this life than first meets the eye. At the very least it should inform us to look for what is not readily evident, to look further down the road and, perhaps, to both sides.The Seven Storey Mountain is a journey unto itself and the patient reader will reap it's rewards. I am no mystical, New Age daydreamer, but I've learned that cold pragmatism will not suffice to furnish a life well-lived and well-loved. Thomas Merton addressed these issues with grace and humility; two virtues from which we all could benefit more. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book generates many responses, depending on the reader's state of mind when he picks it up.I read it at a very critical point in my life, and it started me on a journey that ended, like Merton, in the Catholic Church, but not in a monastery. Why? I don't know. It's not great literature. It is nothing like his later works, written after he matured in ways that he would never have expected when this was written. It is an 'immature' book. He's reported to have said later in life that he wished he had never written it. But he did, and it's a good thing.It gives us a starting point. Other contemplatives probably went through many of these feelings, but not many of them wrote at this point in their lives. Merton talked later about the irony of forsaking all possessions in the morning, and signing the publishing contract for this book in the afternoon. That tension stands out here. The man stands in two worlds. One (his past) that he has rejected, but can not let go of, and the other that he needs (is there any other reason for becoming a monk?), but hasn't grown into.This is his story. It's not the story of a monk. It's not the story of a secular man. It's the story of a man who was to become one of the most influential monks of the century, almost in spite of himself, but he wasn't there yet. He's still new, caught up in bliss, not yet aware of the things that come with the life he had chosen (or had chosen him, if you want to say it that way).As I said, it is a hard book to rate. There are times in a sincere man's life when it is going to speak to something within him. If it does, this could be one of the most interesting things he will ever read."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I'm reading this book for the 2nd time -- the 1st time changed my life. Funny, that seems to be a recurrent theme in these reviews. I started reading it expecting a dense academic work, and was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that it is a life-changing book and a good read to boot. Merton is unbelievable; his candid (and funny) observations about himself, his self-absorbtion, his pride and his misery made me so clearly see the same things in myself, and humbly sprint back into God's arms. P.S. -- In response to the reviewer who was disappointed because Merton didn't discuss having a child out of wedlock in the book (How dare we compare the book to St. Augustine's Confessions?): It is my understanding that, in his original manuscript, Merton was very frank about his past, including the pregnancy. However, his superiors at Gethsemene made him take it out, &quot;cleaning the book up&quot; a bit for his 1950s audience."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"How does one rate a man's spiritual autobiography? This is a self-examination shared with us of a man's passage from an aimless, meaningless life to a meaningful communion with his God, and we assign little stars to it? It seems almost funny in a surreal way, but this man's moving life story and the way in which he organizes this story with great subtlety according to the pattern of Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\" definitely earns five stars by such conventions.I had already read Merton's collection of articles \\"Mystics and Zen Masters\\" more out of my interest in Zen (what does a Christian monk say about it?), but reading that made me want to know more about the guy himself, so this was definitely the right book for that purpose. What I sensed in the prior book was an ability to appreciate other contemplative religious traditions not through some mushy new-age relatiivism but rather through a very solid grounding in his own tradition; in \\"Seven Storey Mountain\\" he shares the long and painful process that led to that grounding, and interestingly at an earlier stage when he was less open to the validity of other paths up to the peak. He may come across as a bit dogmatic to some here, but it makes sense that he needed to devote himself wholeheartedly to his way until he had matured spiritually (also, Catholics have endured a long history of discrimination in the US, so perhaps they're a bit defensive sometimes. Then too, converts such as Merton, having consciously chosen a faith, tend to really be gung ho for it). Anyway, he calls it like he sees it, which is part of the total sum of sincerity that makes this such a superb, five star spiritual autobiography."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Merton's book offers refuge and sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of modern life. Like the monastery to which he fled as a young man, this book is an island of peace and serenity in a world that often seems geared to over-stimulate us and make us forget what's truly important in life.\\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" describes Merton's life from birth to the beginning of his religious vocation as a Trappist monk. Along the way, the reader watches as Merton grows and develops, travelling across Europe, dabbling in Communism, educating himself at Oxford and, later, Columbia, seeking fame and fortune as a writer, and wondering at last if he might be called to the monastery.Merton's true gift is an ability to describe his life while also transcending it. He writes not to explain his life, but to explain what he's learned about all life, about our relationships with each other and with God, about how we strive for spiritual development and how we sometimes fall short.One major flaw with this book is its lack of frankness when dealing with Merton's college years. The book's vagueness about his decision to leave England and come to the U.S. leaves the reader wondering if Merton is making much ado about nothing. What many readers may not know is that Merton had gotten a girl pregnant and was told by his stepfather that he should leave the country and restart his education in the U.S. Years later, when writing the book, Merton had reportedly wanted to detail this episode of his life, but was overruled by members of his religious order. Because of this, the book suffers, and the uninformed reader loses some sense of the size of the mountains Merton climbed to reach his final destination.In the end, though, flaws and all, this is still an indispensable book. It often seems to be speaking directly to the reader, offering insights and wisdom that linger long after the final page is turned."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"At the beginning of A Seven Storey Mountain, there is \\"A Note to the Reader,\\" written by William H. Shannon, Founding President of the International Thomas Merton Society. There is a quote from this note which I believe sums up the book:\\"The Seven Storey Mountain, I believe it can be said, is the story of a young man named Thomas Merton being judged by a monk named Father Louis.\\"Father Louis of course, is the name Merton was given when he was accepted into the monastery.While reading the book, I always felt as if Thomas Merton the monk was suppressing the life events of Thomas Merton the man. You have to understand that this book was written by a monk and censured by monks. There are many details that were omitted, namely Merton's fathering of an illegitimate child and details of his college years. While I understand why these things were omitted, it can be confusing to the reader why Merton was so wracked with guilt and tortured by his existence. The material in the book suggests he was an above average intellect who drank, partied and engaged in the social norms of any college student. I couldn't help but feeling that Merton was walking on eggshells while writing this story. That his life was very much like that of Kerouac and the beats; wild, drunken, exciting and full of debauchery, but here in the Seven Storey Mountain, all of that was censored and molded into a very tame and at times a very dull account.I would love to read an uncensored version of The Seven Storey Mountain, although I know that will never happen. The gritty details of Merton's life are important because I feel it would better show the incredible contrast and transformation from the sinner to the saint. As is, it comes across as a very pedestrian tale of an average man who becomes an incredible spiritual thinker and writer. This in itself is still incredible, but not as impactful as a story.The parts I loved the most were Merton's deep insight into the spiritual connection with God, and I feel there wasn't enough of that. I love his book Thoughts in Solitude, and there are moments in this book that remind me of that, but not enough. It is mostly a linear account of his life, which as I've stated before, is heavily censored and watered down. Honestly, it is a very hard book to get through because it can be very dull.I would recommend you read all or most of Merton's spiritual works and if you want to know more about him, read this last."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton's \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is one of the classics of Christian literature and was one of the best selling books of the twentieth century. It will last well into this century as well. There is something about a worldly man giving up so much of the promise that life has to offer to live the austere life of a monk. While the book somewhat echoes St. Augustine's \\"Confessions,\\" we see more of the emptiness of Merton's life prior to his conversion to Catholicism than we would find in Augustine's work as well as the role that faith played in his life. Readers are fascinated with Merton's life, and even if it cannot be emulated by most of us, we admire Merton's willingness to enter a monastery and it helps us re-evaluate our own faith.One of the things that I find interesting about \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is the way it can speak differently to a person over the years. I first became acquainted with the book when I came across an old, dusty and mildewy copy of the book in our cellar. I was probably in the sixth or seventh grade and decided to read it but put it down after one page when I was told I was too young to understand it. This inspired me to one day read the book. I finally read it while I was in college and saw Merton as an adventurer, and could relate to the boldness of his actions and the reality of his faith. As I have gotten older and reread the book or passages of the book, I see his writings differently, yet they still speak to me. Merton becomes less of a bold maverick and more of a person seeing what our hearts are all seeking, but not necessarily finding it. He becomes less of a hero and more of a person whose flaws speak as powerfully as his insights and discoveries about faith. In this way he is very much like his literary ancestor, St. Augustine.Over the years interested in Merton seems to grow. At the time this review is being written, his works are being republished and a biography of Merton using his actual journal is now available. This first book is essential for anyone who has even a casual interest in Merton. Readers with an interest in Merton may also find Paul Elie's \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\\" helpful as well. This book, which also looks at the lives of Walker Percy, Flannery O'Connor, and Dorothy Day, puts Merton in both a historical and literary context."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton is a wonderful voice for the spiritual yearning that lies within us all. Merton, a trappist monk expressed the spirituality of so many people that longed for a religion that could both function within the bounds of Christianity and bring it to life. Thus it is with this poet, monk, and student of the Zen Masters the world recieved a new voice on its oldest subject. In this book, Merton's spiritual autobiography, one comes in contact with a truly beautiful human being. This book has my nomination for the great twentieth century American novel. It is a book in which every word echoes the warmth and passion of its author.Thomas, You will be sadly missed."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I lived in Kentucky for 10 years, and I heard of Thomas Merton. I was afraid to try to read any of his works as I thought that they would be so deep I wouldn't be able to relate. Thomas Merton has shared with us his journey into Cistercian life that was easy to read, and I found myself not wanting to put it down, and when I finished I found that I wanted to hear more from him. It reminded me of the life of St. Augustine."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is a warmly personal autobiography written in a relaxed style and liberally sprinkled with Merton's wry humor, directed mostly at himself. It is a superb look at one human soul's odyssey from loneliness and self-absorption to a total surrender to God. If he occasionally goes overboard with his religious musings, he can be forgiven, as the excesses of youthful idealism usually are; anyway, it's worth noting that within just a few years of this book's publication (in 1948) his intellectual and spiritual development had advanced so much that, as far as he was concerned, the Thomas Merton of &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; was &quot;dead.&quot; But the Thomas Merton revealed in these pages is very much alive and the story of his life's journey is compelling and unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book was tremendous. Although I am not involved in any religion (especially the catholic church), I found this book inspiring. I could only wish for the enlightenment and serinity Thomas Merton had after he entered the Trappist Monastery. The one thing that threw me about this book was that there were to many lines in latin. There were many paragraphs that ended in some other language. I am not sure if he was only repeating the line before or if it was some terrific statement that I missed because I only know one language. I'm not quite sure. Besides that this book is excellent for people with different religious backgrounds. It was a wonderful book and I am more enlightened because of it."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The Seven Storey Mountain is a beautifully written book. Thomas Merton was a brilliant intellectual who had looked at many different types of belief. Merton realizes that he isn't happy, though, and he continues to search until he is converted to Christianity. The Seven Storey Mountain is the story of Merton's journey from being that confused and despairing intellectual to being a secure and happy Trappist monk.The Seven Storey Mountain offers the reader so much. It is an extraordinary way to build faith. The picture of courage that Merton presents as someone actually willing to give up himself for his belief in God is so inspiring. Some of the passages about God are so beautiful. The only possible warning I have for this book is that its possible that some Protestant readers may be slightly offended by some rather general criticisms pointed at non-Catholic Christians. Still, these in no way detracted from the book for me, and I think that any reader of this book will benefit despite some any doctrinal differences. The Seven Storey Mountain is moving and joyful story of a man's journey to God, and it is a journey which should be celebrated and learned from."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book has changed the way I think. The insights I gained from it (e.g.,selfishness is the root of all sin and the only thing that separates a person from God)have clarified so much of my religion and what it means to find God. What strikes mein this and in his other writings is that he is one of those all too rare writers whoclearly knows what it means to be a Catholic in the twentieth century: how to apply this2000-year old world-view to an era in which it is taken for granted that such a view doesnot apply (see his later essays on race relations and nuclear war for furtherstriking proof of this). His disdain for affected piety, the gloomy, medieval phrasingof the transliterated French in penny catechisms with which most adult Catholicsare very familiar, is all the more refreshing because he does not react to it by abandoningor smoothing over any Catholic doctrines (though his later concern for ecumenism hasyet to develop). While few converts since Newman have been so eloquent, his view of the Church is typical of a convert, one who has accepted it of his own accord, having grownto see its beauty from a distance. But most of all, having lived in 20th century Americato the full (ahem), he combines this appreciation of the Church with a deepunderstanding of the way the average North American thinks today. His humour, whichliberally seasons the book, has such an ironic and often biting tone that you aresurprised to be reading a Trappist monk and not a syndicated columnist. His writingstyle alone could be studied in depth, as the descriptive passages of his youth are amongthe most beautiful you may ever read. And yet it is the substance of the book that makes it the greatest spiritual autobiography of this century: what it means to discard the unbelievable materialism of our times, to treat his religion as a matter of great moment and urgency rather than as a mere intellectual exercise, source of endless polemical debate or self-esteem builder. All the terms that easily become cliched by overuse and provoke fear, ridicule or despondent skepticism (&quot;grace&quot;, &quot;contemplation&quot;, &quot;penance&quot;, etc.) are injected with heartfelt,vibrant meaning in this book; meaning that has been experienced in the confusion and banality of our culture, and not coldly described in the abstract. Anyone who doesnot understand Catholicism (or thinks that they do), how it can be vigorously applied totwentieth century life, or knows no one who can demonstrate the full meaningfulness of it to them, should read this book and his later (1960s) essays."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This story of youthful conversion strangely remains the most famous of Merton books, and is usually called a \\"classic spiritual autobiography\\" though it is really neither. Which is not to say it lacks value; it is evident that decades after publication it retains its original power for many. Doubtless its status owes a lot to its partial inarticulateness, and the obvious youth of its subject. Others at about the same stage of life may justly understand it and prize those qualities, and gloss over its faults. It has a certain unabashed personal quality that cannot be faked.Truth is, the Merton who penned this book was somewhat self-dramatizing, a quality that cannot be attributed to his order, his abbot, censors, etc. He came indeed to recognize this later. His sins, such as they were at this stage of life, have been documented in Michael Matt's authoritative biography, and are not significantly out of the ordinary for a son of Bohemian parents and an orphan at early age. The self-chastisement for wine, women, and song is way overdone; all his youthful friends male and female grew up to be solid citizens and they really were not that far off the beam from the start.So much for straight autobiography; as far as its spiritual side it demonstartes a refreshingly candid acceptance of Catholic devotional life, but nothing of the dimensionality and erudition the writer later became famous for. The dismissal of certain Protestant spiritual paths is superficial and arch, and later embarrassed Merton himself. Yet again, this is what he himself wanted to put in; no one forced him to do it. The funny thing was that young Merton was simultaneously doing some good straight journal writing, some remarkable modernist fiction (My Argument With the Gestapo plus some lost manuscripts) and interesting poetry.Simply, the effort was an early attempt to reinvent himself on paper. He later (and not greatly later) discovered this was impossible. The appeal in its own day was that it struck a chord in many in the immediate post-World War 2 world, emblematic of a second \\"lost generation.\\"But where lies its continuing appeal? One can only surmise that it strikes a continuing chord. In many ways, the 2nd world war never ended. The materialism and consumerism that became more evident in its wake never let up, and is now in hyperdrive. People know in their gut there is much more; a few will always leave the pack and go exploring in that direction. Most will excuse a few unsightly warts for a personal statement that is still broadly honest, where it counts. And finally, there is the singular facet of the choice for a devotional life. Although of course this will never make sense to many, even many Catholics from those days or from now, still this is a definable chunk of any human population that will never go away -- that remnant who will follow this true sort of \\"call of the wild\\" and follow the lamb anywhere."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is a wonderful book, although it is indeed quite Augustinian- almost Dostoyevskian- in the degree to which Merton publically flagellates himself here for not having found his destiny until he became a Catholic and a Trappist.If you can get past that - and his jibes at Protestants- you can appreciate the Merton of the late 1940s/early 50s, who was quite on fire spiritually. (I do, however, greatly admire his take onthe Oxford Movement- precursor to Alchoholics Anonymous. Merton was dead on target there!) His description of his experience in a church in Cuba is simply amazing first hand of what Buddhists would call an enlightenment experience.I for one appreciate more his contemplative works. (Of course, as a Buddhist, what might you expect?)

I read this book in 1985 and has been one of the best books I have read, not for its literary quality, but for the impact it has had in my life. This book is an autobiographical account of Merton, and his life upon entering a Trappist monestary in Kentucy. The author's account of his life and conversion moved me enough to persue a life in ordained ministry in the Catholic Church. I continue to recomend this book to anyone seeking his or her vocation in life. Fr. Daniel Kelley Diocese of Fort Worth"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton entered a Trappist monastery in Kentucky at 26, having been thoroughly immersed in the world. Five years later the abbot suggested that Merton write the story of his life. Merton was a natural writer, and his story flowed out over the next four years to become a classic. I have read many of Merton's books but I only recently read his autobiography. Although some of his opinions changed and he matured in the twenty years he lived after writing this book, he had already displayed an open honesty with himself and his reader, and his passion and brilliance were ever there. His fascinating story is written like a good novel. His father was Welsh, born in New Zealand, his mother, American. They met in Paris, where Merton was born. Both were artists, and Merton was raised in a rather Bohemian way. His memory of early events is phenomenal. He recalls in detail events around his mother's death when he was six. He was not allowed to visit her in the hospital, and his father delivered a note to Thomas from his mother informing him that she was dying. After her death Thomas sometimes traveled with his father, sometimes lived with his grandparents, and sometimes with friends his father found to care for him. He crossed the Atlantic from time to time and eventually attended college at Columbia in New York City, where he had a group of close friends with whom he drank, smoked, dated, and carried on many intellectual conversations. He tells how his religious search developed and how astonished his friends were when he told them, \\"I am going to be a priest,\\" and they realized he wasn't joking. The years of working out his vocation are most interesting. The great gift of Merton is that in becoming a monk, he does not lose his humor, his playful spirit, his intensity, his humility, his clear eye for the world. Here is part of a prayer he wrote about making his first vows: \\"That morning when I was lying on my face on the floor in the middle of the church, with Father Abbot praying over me, I began to laugh, with my mouth in the dust, because without knowing how or why, I had actually done the right thing, and even an astounding thing. But what was astounding was not my work, but the work You worked in me.\\"Two years before his death Merton wrote this preface to the Japanese edition of this book: \\"Perhaps if I were to attempt this book today, it would be written differently. Who knows? But it was written when I was still quite young, and that is the way it remains. The story no longer belongs to me. . . Therefore, most honorable reader, it is not as an author that I would speak to you, not as a storyteller, not as a philosopher, not as a friend only. I seek to speak to you, in some way, as your own self. Who can tell what this may mean? I myself do not know, but if you listen, things will be said that are perhaps not written in this book. And this will be due not to me but to the One who lives and speaks in both.\\""},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"- Just wanted to cast another five-star vote for a deserving book.- Perhaps you've wondered why, in this time of a major decline in religious vocations, such a book would be so popular, and I did too until I read it. This is more than the tale of a man running from the world to enter a monastery -- his appeal is far more universal, and his goals are far more positive. Many people wonder how to be the best possible person they can be, and go through some challenging times while they make those decisions. Merton's methods, honesty, and trusting attitude are inspirational -- rather than ignore or indefinitely defer questions, Merton examines them, jettisons the excess emotional baggage which often clouds our intuition, realizes his limitations, and trusts what follows. A good heart and mind are the groundwork for good choices. \\"Mountain\\" rarely gives abstractions or generalizations, but instead gives practical examples of Merton finding the spiritual in daily living and making it an adventure. He also suggests the value of things we often overlook, including the value of simplicity, a basic confidence in compassion and love, an openness to uncertainty, and the value of character.- I am convinced that \\"Mountain\\" is one of the books that can actually make one want to be a better person. It's well worth five stars."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This autobiography of the early years and conversion to Catholicism of the Trappist Monk Thomas Merton is highly engaging and often quite beautiful in it's descriptions of the value of faith and the the importance of a contemplative life. What I found difficult was the constant condescension toward other faiths, which seemed very strange for a man who would become a champion of ecumenicism, and who wold die decades later on a tour of Asia, where he addressed an interfaith conference of monks.I was glad to learn later that Merton said he regretted much of this book, and for my own enjoyment I will assume it is this over-eagerness of a recent convert that he regretted.Beyond this one complaint I can say that it is a beautiful book with value beyond the Catholic world, as well a good introduction to Merton."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The Seven Storey Mountain takes the reader on the spiritual journey of Thomas Merton - poet, scholar, world traveler - as he makes his way to God. Merton is a true Renaissance man of the modern world, who has experienced what the secular world has to offer - and, finally chooses the solitude and silence of a Trappist monastery. This is to be his vehicle for coming closer to God. That he chooses to share his journey with the reader is like opening the doors of a house of great riches for all to experience. Merton willingly gives the reader a glimpse into his soul and the result is unforgettable. Each reader will take something different from these riches - depending on where he is at on his own journey."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Merton knew how to plow through his past life so that the grace of God, the spirit of Christ would become so apparent in all that happened to him and through him in this autobiography.No sentimentalism. No archaic language. His descriptions of the Eucharist and the other sacraments are clean and fresh and deep and vivid, touching the reader with a strange, immediate conviction. His words pulsate with faith. He makes you say, &quot;well, maybe I don't know...&quot;I think Merton brings the worldly closer to the church and the churchy closer to the world. People don't know where to place him. You cannot stick a label on him.This book is great for just anyone. Those who are cradle Catholics will benefit greatly from this man who came into the church, this man who was so biased against anything Catholic, and yet who came in no contact with any &quot;crisis&quot; that suddenly made him say, &quot;LORD! LORD!&quot;. No. That is, no crisis of the &quot;world&quot;. It was spiritual. The account of &quot;something&quot; that happened to him while laying in his bed is simple and vivid.He makes you realize that what is spiritual has to do with what is human."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Something that most people forget about or just plain ignore in today's world of hustle and bustle. Something that Thomas Merton rediscovered and has shared with us. The Seven Storey Mountain takes us through the life of Thomas Merton, from his childhood all the way to his acceptance at a Trappist monastery in Kentucky. Throughout it all, Thomas examines his life in full detail, revealing what most people don't want to admit about their own lives....that they alone are responsible for their own unhappiness. As he realizes just how miserable and empty his life really is, he notices that all along God had been calling him to something greater...a life full of peace, happiness, and contemplation. And like every one of us, the only requirement for this life is to simply accept it. Sometimes confusing due to the fact that he was a Catholic and I am not, this book was still an incredibly enlightening and thoroughly enjoyable book. After reading this book, you will likely look forward to carving some time out of your busy day to simply sit and ponder the wonders of God, which coincidentally, is when you will finally hear God speaking to you."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This famous autobiography chronicles the author's life from childhood up to the point as a young man he makes the bold decision to enter the Trappist order. Like many of us, Merton spiritually sleepwalks through much of his youth. But gradually, he is drawn to God as he comes to perceive the shallowness and futility of the intellectuality and self-indulgence that had thusfar characterized his life. Eventually his love for God becomes a passion of awesome proportions, enabling him to bring his life into a wonderous balance, inspiring him to write some of the most influential religious reflections of our age or perhaps any age.The questions Merton grapples with here--how to balance the seemingly conflicting impulses of our intellect, passions, and spirit--are timeless. Anyone looking for greater harmony in his/her life will undoubtedly find great insight and inspiration from Merton's story.Also--I think today \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is particularly relevant because of its historical context, which so closely parallels our own. Much of Merton's story takes place during the outbreak of World War II. As war looms larger and larger, Merton describes with great unease the sense of impending doom, the uncertainty of where the world is heading, and yet the certainty it is heading somewhere disturbing and dangerous. As I read Merton's reflections on the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia--a defining act of war--for a moment I thought I was reading about September 11. The looming threat of terrorism gives us a newfound ability to relate to Merton's world, and this I think makes his message far more accessible, meaningful, and necessary for us to hear."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton gave up wordly and litarary fame to become a Trappist monk. In this heavy volume, he discusses how much for the better his life changed. Though I was not raised in this country, I found his sacrifice and subsequent enlightenment beautiful. His veneration and deep understanding of the role of Mary, Mother of God, in our Church is unusual in a Protestant convert but wonderful. Some of his thoughts echo Cardinal Newman, also a wonderful Catholic writer and convert, especially his wonder at the unswerving, unchanging faith and dogma of the Church. Truly an important read for all converts to Catholicism and for all Catholics seeking to return to the wonder and beauty of the faith."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I would like to state first that this edition is not the exact edition that I read. The one that I read featured a strangely imaginative cover of a \\"seven storey mountain\\" that was quite interesting to look at(perhaps more like a fantasy cover) as I made my way along the long journey woven with in this book.Ah this book was great, like a soothing cup of tea it works on many levels. First of all, this is wonderfully written. I was instantly drawn in to his life, from his childhood, to his college days, to his partying days, to his Trappist Days.This book reminded me that as different as things are today then in Merton's day they are essentially the same. He stayed out at clubs until four in the morning, just as Kerouac did, and most young poeple do today. It's really so familiar, and accessible.I think about this book often. I think about how Merton must have wandered the streets of Manhattan looking for his faith, and living a very \\"Manhattan\\" life. It's amazing to think that a man that can write so lovingly of one of the most urban modern populated settings in the entire world could find more peace on essentially a farm, a Trappist One at that.This book was given to my college room mate by his father who asked him as a favor to read it. He never did, but somehow it found its way into my hands. I opened it up, and was taken in by the beautiful openness of the story, and the very elegant style.I had read On the Road by Kerouac, and many other \\"classic american novels\\" that many read while at College, but I wondered why this was left off of the list. It seems only to be on \\"Catholic\\" or \\"Christian\\" lists. I don't think that is fair of this book. It transcends any genre. It's simply a great read. Yes it has a preachy tone. I appreciate that because it's honest. Believers believe. And if someone is a believer then that should definitely come out in thier story. Merton later tones his Faith down adopting a more 'inclusive' tone to his writings, and subjects of his writings as well, but this is written by a very fresh believer. It's written by someone burning to tell thier story, and why they think that thier story is important. And I believe that this story is important, important to anyone that wants to read one of the best autobiographies in American literature, as well as anyone that wants to be touched by a beautiful story of conversion from a very artistic intellectual yet empty life. He had his art, and his ideas, but there was still a hole. And the story of how that hole is ultimately filled is here interwoven in a beautifully honest way."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Part literary analysis, part theological speculation, and largely spiritual autobiography, this 467 page tome is a much easier read than one might initially expect. There were times when, as a non-Catholic, I got bogged down in some of the particulars of the tradition, but much of the book has a universal appeal. The Seven Storey Mountain tells of Merton's journey from agnosticism to Catholicism, from self-absorbed young man to contemplative monk. The work is well enough written to have captured the imagination of countless readers, and it has even been translated into 20 languages. The Protestant reader may be either annoyed or amused (depending on his personality) by Merton's jabs at Protestantism. He does, however, have the magnanimity to frequently compliment Protestants for having \\"at least that much of religion.\\""},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book has been around as long as I've been alive and I have read it several times. Of all religious centered books that I have read, I believe that The Seven Storey Mountain brought me back into the Catholic Faith. Thomas Merton was not an angel and neither were the Saints. Thomas Merton was and is a complex person. If you read this auto-biography, you will not know the real Thomas Merton. It would be beneficial to read his Journals to get a real look into his mind and in the way he expresses the mystery of God and religous life. His desire for seclusion in the monastic life was constantly being challenged by his prolific writings and his popularity in the \\"outside world.\\" It is also interesting to note that Thomas' background was English Litertature and not Theology, which is to me an enigma in that how can someone from a secular background have the knowledge base of describing his journey into the Great Mystery. Thomas was truly given the gift of the Holy Spirit in order to write his wonderful journey for us to follow with him.I totally recommend this great book for anyone who wants to understand their own journey into the Great Mystery."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"It was quite refreshing to read such clear prose describing a journey of faith from over half a century ago. Merton is writing from his time period, aware of prejudices and doubts from the WW II era, but there is timeless message about the beauty and power of faith. Interesting that a monk who took a vow of silence is one of the 20th century's most eloquent writers, able to convey what he thought and felt as a young man, growing up in France, England, and the United States in the shadows of war."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Most reviewers have touched on my own reflections. The book is not meant to be a scientific journal (re: one reviewer wrote Merton should have studied Newton's laws of motion). The story is one man's own spiritual journey---take it or leave it---but don't dismiss it because it doesn't cover the disciplines you find most fulfilling and awarding. Science is grand---but it does little to account for the life and light in the soul; that is why Merton turns to the poets and contemplatives in his yearning for truth or for some kind of answer to the longing in the deepest parts of him. Anyone satisfied with believing only what they can touch,see, feel may not enjoy this book. It is the transcendents Merton is concerned with when he realizes time and again materialism and atheism leave him empty and spiritually bankrupt.Take Merton's book for what it is. A man's spiritual journey. If you want a man's scientific journey or a man's journey from religious dogma to secular dogma---read something else."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The writings of Merton have always been challenging. Most people think of monks as those who have withdrawn from the world and all of its problems. This is not the case, at least not for Merton. His monastic life granted him the ability to tackle issues of war, economics, violence, etc. Yet, he was never fully comfortable regardless of where he was, yet found peace amidst the searching for a world more attuned to the way it was created. This book is a masterpiece of an autobiography. It will introduce you to one of the most interesting and inspiring voices of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Few writers of spiritual books ever reach the high literary mark that Thomas Merton sets in The Seven Storey Mountain. At its core, The Seven Storey Mountain is pure memoir. Merton accounts for his life up to the time of writing when he was about 30 years old. Within this account, he places insights on spirituality, and the account on the whole offers a grand lesson on God's providence and mankind's undying need for reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ.Merton's life story unfolds with tragedy upon tragedy. His mother died from cancer when he was 5 years old, and then less than 12 years later his father died from cancer. Merton was left with a guardian and grandparents who cared for him from arm's length.Merton's education is vast. He is as well read and learned as any writer of memoir that I have read. Unfortunately, as a teenager his education led him away from God and to an attitude of atheism or agnosticism at times. As he pursues greater education, God pursues him through authors and teachers.Merton credits William Blake's writings and art with playing a significant role in his salvation. Merton then begins reading a book on Catholic Philosophy that also has a profound impact on his perception of God and the religion. Mostly, Merton credits the intercession of others for his salvation, \\"Who prayed for me? One day I shall know. But in the economy of God's love, it is through the prayers of other men that these graces are given. It was through the prayers of someone who loved God that I was one day, to be delivered out of that hell where I was already confined without knowing it.\\" (109) Merton takes no credit for his salvation or spiritual growth. He gives all credit to the gracious work of God.His book illustrates the journey of a young man from enlightened atheism to humble faith in God. Merton's faith and learning are complimentary not contradictory. He shows readers that true enlightenment and learning leads to the ultimate truth, and this truth gives hope not fear, assurance not doubt, and salvation not annihilation.Merton writes to his readers of this truth he has learned that I think is the message of his book, \\"And yet now I tell you, you who are now what I once was, unbelievers, it is that Sacrament, and that alone, the Christ living in our midst, and sacrificed by us, and for us and with us, in the clean and perpetual Sacrifice, it is He alone Who holds our world together, and keeps us all from being poured headlong and immediately into the pit of our eternal destruction. And I tell you there is a power that goes forth from that Sacrament, a power of light and truth into the hearts of those who have heard nothing of Him and seem to be incapable of belief.\\" (41)As expressed in the above quote, Merton's faith is rooted in the Catholic religion. This causes some trouble to me as he exalts Mary the mother of Jesus to a place alongside her son as a mediator and advocate for people. Merton asserts Mary is as responsible for his coming to God as Jesus. At times of trouble, he prays to Mary and a litany of saints for help. He discusses praying for souls in purgatory and wiping out sins through almsgiving. In addition to few slights at Protestant religions, these items may be stumbling blocks to some readers.Merton reveals a spiritual journey that takes him eventually to his desired home in a Trappist monastery where he, at his Director's urging, continues to write and publish while seeking God in solitude. His is a process engineered by the hand of Providence, as it led his steps and transformed his heart. I think any sincere reader who approaches Merton with an open mind and heart will find insights applicable to him or her at the current time of life.Craig Stephans, author of Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I picked up this book a year ago and found it tough to get through the early stages of Merton's life. After putting it aside for several months, I found myself attacking it again. Merton shows his readers that his life was far from perfect--just like ours! He wasn't the typical Catholic-bred schoolboy who fell into the church because of his heritage.This book shows the journey of a man who didn't believe in God to a man who would surrender his life to God. The steps and stops in his life show us the many times God tapped him on the shoulder and how he eventually listened."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is a wonderful book, although it is indeed quite Augustinian- almost Dostoyevskian- in the degree to which Merton publically flagellates himself here for not having found his destiny until he became a Catholic and a Trappist.If you can get past that - and his jibes at Protestants- you can appreciate the Merton of the late 1940s/early 50s, who was quite on fire spiritually.

However, Augustine has the upper hand here due to his immense honesty of his sins, while Merton alludes to sinful actions without exactly saying what he did wrong, leading the reader to wonder what exactly he's complaining about. Merton's fathering of an illegimate child while at Cambridge is a crucial event which leads to his leaving England, coming to New York and eventually into the Church, but is never plainly stated, and in fact one has to read the preface to find out what happened.Thomas Merton's convert zeal is impressive throughout the book, and that the book shows an inside view of a man's love for his God is its one redeeming factor. This reviewer's complain is that Merton claims to want to live a better life, but he spurns the poor and unfortunate people of the world, fleeing to solitude to work for his salvation alone. The reader would think, if only Merton had shown his love for God through helping the needy, we'd have one of the greatest charity workers in history. But instead, Merton comes across as an uncaring, incompassionate man.THE SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN is, of course, a story of conversion and is therefore written in a frenzy of love for God. His later works are much more concerned with ecumenicalism and world events from a monastic viewpoint, and so the reader should know that those books read differently."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Even for a non-Catholic agnostic kind of person, this book was a near life-changing event. Having read Merton's work on Eastern things (Chuang-tzu, etc.) I came to this book with an open mind. What I found in reading it was a story of a child of the early nineteen forties who turned toward God. He was actually a classmate at Columbia (or a near contemporary) of Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg..... and they ended up trying to find salvation in a similar, but different manner....It's a wholly worthwhile book for anyone to read though for some I could imagine the section after his conversion (which would strike many of his readers as the most profound section of the book) could end up being a bit tiresome...."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton stands as one of the greatest figures ever produced by the contemplative stream of Christianity. The Seven Storey Mountain is the story of how he came to faith and the depth of wonder he found there.Set in the first half of the twentieth century, The Seven Storey Mountain follows Merton from his childhood on until his entry into a monastery in Kentucky.I was moved by many of the details of Merton's early life: the loss of his mother, his relationship with his father, and his adventures in education. Merton skillfully lays out the background of these events. Time and again, the common humanity of Merton shines through across barriers of time, place, and experience.This Book is a masterpiece. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"One of the best books ever. The story of a young man's journey towards faith and vocation. An inspirational resource in a world in need of spiritual transformation."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"It is rare to find intellectual conversion stories so moving and personable as this. That is why this book has become such a great classic - it is intellectual food for thought, profound understanding of the human condition, and spiritually inspirational all at once. It is this that made Thomas Merton an intellectual to whom we can all relate. It is his love for mankind that made him the voice of so many for a better way of peace in time of great suffering and war. Comparable to, and in some respects, improved upon another great intellectual conversion story in Newman's,Apologia pro vita sua. A rare gem that conveys the deep truth of how the Catholic faith is life-changing and intellectually satisfying to so many."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I picked it up because I wanted to know about the conversion experience firsthand. On what it felt like to be called to wear the habit, more specifically. And ti was interesting on many levels, as well as informative and enlightening for my own journey."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I am a catholic, and after many years I finally read this book. Frankly, I am disappointed. Were it not for the wonderful introduction by Robert Giroux, the reader would not have learned of Merton's fathering of an illegimate child. Merton does not discuss this in the book. How then can anyone seriously compare this with St. Augustine's Confessions? I wanted to learn about the monks, who they were, where they came from, and why they entered the monastery. Their backgrounds would have been very interesting, but Merton gives us none of this. I found the spiritual passages too simplistic, like my catholic grammar school catechism."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I'm not Catholic, and I'm never going to be Catholic, but I ejoyed reading Thomas Merton's religious journey anyway. He felt there was something missing in his life, even though he was popular and successful in the secular world, and he looked until he found what was missing. In his case, he found God, and a certainty that there were order and love in the world.I found it easy to follow Merton through most of his journey, because he seems like an ordinary person. I even understood his self-loathing, because sometimes I feel like I'm missing something, and not doing what I ought to be doing. His writing in the early sections is clear and simple, but also very descriptive. But once he converted, I found the book harder to follow, especially when he included poetry, or sang about the wonder and glory of God.I call myself a spiritual atheist. That means I have a sense of wonder at the world, and I try to be open, but I don't believe anything I can't prove. So I couldn't relate to Merton's experience of God the way I related to his secular life. Also, I was a little upset by how certain he is that the pre-Vatican II Catholic Church is the only right religion. I understand he became more open, but when he wrote &quot;The Seven Story Mountain,&quot; he was still a recent convert. He seems almost smug, the way he glories in his relationship with God.Just a thought: Merton grew up without much religion. People who don't have a religion are more likely to convert to other religions later, and believe in them strongly. That's how a lot of people join cults. If you look at Merton that way, he's like the people who joined the Heaven's Gate cult. They believed strongly enough to withdraw from the world and kill themselves. Merton didn't kill himself, but he withdrew and tried as hard as he could to be a completely different person. That's just something to consider, when you talk about Merton's spiritual virtues. He's really not that special. He just picked an established religion and wrote well.I admire people who have the willpower to really look hard for something they think they need, but I'm not really comfortable with what Merton finds as his answer."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I bought this for a 30 year old man who is searching for meaning in his life."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I reviewed this book a few years ago. It has, however, receded greatly in its importance in my life, as I am now married happily and have left all the guilt of my life as a single man behind. Yes, Seven Storey has some good commentary about the plight of modern mankind in it, but the guilt that Merton feels about his life it seems almost pathological, now that I look back on it. I believe that such a lack of relectiveness related to his own failures (and blaming himself for the evils of the world now seems very strange) within the framework of Catholic church teaching, one sees the darkness of the dogmatism of the time. Perhaps because I have myself become satisfied with my spiritual growth, and not torn usunder and anguished by it, I can no longer very well relate to this book. In many ways, it kept those dark days of guilt about sex and living a happy, fulfilled life as a man very much in the fore. I am glad I once knew this book, and it meant so much to me at one time, but on the whole, I believe that it appeals to people who are possibly WAY too hard on themselves. I think we should all lighten up a bit, in the end, and the world will be a happier place. Perhaps this means getting beyond the dogma of organized religion."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book is supposed to be the autobiography of one of Catholicism's great open minds. But Merton's mind is largely closed. Merton bashes nearly everyone in this book, Anglicans, people without faith, protestants of all colors. He does not have a questioning spirit about his own faith, but just parrots some well worn cliches about Roman Catholicism. It seems you must come to Merton loving Merton or you will see nothing here but one man's contempt for others and himself"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"It has taken me six months to get half way through this book. I am sure it will provide wonderful spiritual insight by the end, but it is really slow reading."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Decent potential for this book, but it really began to drag after awhile. I expected more in depth passages detailing his ultiamte decision and eventual life in the monastary. The book dwells too long on his &quot;sinful&quot; lifestyle and not enough on the moments that drew him to Gesthemani."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I struggled through 350 pages of this book before finally giving up. It was extremely boring and as another reviewer aptly put it 'flat and wooden'. As a Catholic convert who has read a fair number of conversion stories (both ancient and modern) this book pales in comparison. I have read conversion stories which are 1/10th the length, but which pack 10 times the inspirational punch. The favorable comparison of this book with St. Augustines Confessions is absurd and insulting to this great saint. The chief problem seems to be that Merton is so self absorbed that he is really writing a book about himself instead of about God, or his relationship with God. This self centeredness fits in perfectly with modern society and probably explains why so many people are fond of it. For the well read Catholic looking to be inspired, steer clear of this mundane book and take a look at something like Saint Therese of Lisieux's 'Story of a soul', or G.K. Chesterton's 'Orthodoxy'. Please don't waste your time or money on this book"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I don't have much to say for this book. It doesn't reveal anything interesting to the learned reader, and just drones on and on about the suffocation of christian dogma. Simply, it added nothing to my experience."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This book was a best seller in the fifties-what was all the fuss about? The author comes across as an arrogant, scientifically uneducated mind. Augustine and Blake?! He should have taken the trouble to learn Newton's laws of motion.

It left the resultants incompetent to discuss anything but egocentrism."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"The story itself is amazing, inspiring and enlightening.

It is equally as relevant for today's reader as it was for those who were privileged to to have read the first edition. There are some typos in the kindle version but they do not distract in any way from comprehension."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is a desert Island book for me. It's Merton's spiritual journey, but much more. This book, like Merton himself, is a study in contradictions. Spiritual and earthly, humility and pride, peace and discontentment. I love Merton because while being sublimely profound, in the next sentence he displays all the faults and shortcomings that we all do. He is brutally honest with himself and the reader, letting us into his world. I often read his memoirs in other volumes (arguably even more compelling than this book) and I get taken to his world, the juxtaposition of Heaven and earthi in the deep south. Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"I was reading this book in a (very good) Italian translation, but then I had to get on a plane with minimum luggage, and the book is thick!

It is somewhat similar to St Augustine's \\"Confessions\\" in that both were writing about their personal lives and their particular path of conversion to the Catholic faith. I would highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially to someone contemplating joining the Catholic Church as it should answer many concerns and the thought process leading to conversion. Most of all, faith is necessary.I was very happy with Amazon's on-line-service in regard to accuracy of order, speed of delivery and packaging. I have bought several items on line from Amazon and their dealers and have always been extremely happy with the results."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"This is an excellent book about a young person who dealt with a great deal of adversity in losing his mother to cancer at a very early age and was forced to spend a great deal of time away from his artist father in growing up. His father later had a close call with his own death and made a strong effort to instill religion in Merton's life by enrolling his son in Cathloic schools in Europe after he survived the ordeal. Merton wrote very well of his numerous experiences and education at some great universities, but found a deep emptiness in the life that he was leading, despite performing very well at Columbia and other prominent schools. In his quest for fulfillment, he becomes drawn to the Catholic faith and finds his calling which eventually, after a great deal of soul searching leads him to becoming a Trappist monk at the Abbey of Gethemani where his contributions on faith with his writings are immeasurable.One does not have to be a Catholic to appreciate the wisdom of this book, but the faith obviously worked for Merton."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Do you want to know what it is that inspires a person to become a monk? Would you believe that these monks are just ordinary folks like you and me? Find out what happens when a worldly man listens to the still quiet voice calling him home! The only criticism I had with this product is that occasionally some of the words in my downloaded copy (for Kindle) were misspelled. I don't know if it was an artifact of the download or the translation. In any case, it's not a real bother. This book is as exciting as any of the top ten novels you may find today - and it is not a novel - but a story of one man's spiritual journey. A must read for those seeking a deeper spiritual life!"},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, as well as a best-selling writer, poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. He wrote many books, includingMystics and Zen Masters,Zen and the Birds of Appetite,The Asian Journal of Thomas Merton (New Directions Books). Tragically, he was accidentally electrocuted while in Thailand at a conference of Christian and non-Christian monks.This book, originally published in 1948, details Merton's progression from a very \\"worldly\\" college student (known as a \\"womanizer\\" who read \\"filthy novels\\") and professing atheist until he became a Trappist monk---the Trappists being known then for their maintenance of silence. (Interestingly, he ultimately found the monastery \\"too noisy,\\" and moved into a private hermitage on the grounds.)He describes his feelings upon opening a copy of Gilson'sThe Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy, \\"while I admired Catholic culture, I had always been afraid of the Catholic Church... I consider that it was surely a real grace that, instead of getting rid of the book, I actually read it.\\" (Pg. 172) Later, after a conversation with a Hindu monk, he recalled that \\"now I was told that I ought to turn to the Christian tradition, to St. Augustine---and told by a Hindu monk!\\" (Pg. 198)While reading a book on English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, he felt an inner urging repeatedly, and he rushed out, located the local priest, and told him, \\"Father, I want to become a Catholic.\\" (Pg. 216) Later, he recounts that \\"I cannot say what caused it: it was not a reaction of especially strong disgust at being so tired and so uninterested in this life I was still leading, in spite of its futility... It was something in the order of conscience... I said casually, 'You know, I think I ought to go and enter a monastery and become a priest.'\\" (Pg. 253)After becoming a Trappist, he observed that \\"our monasteries produce very few pure contemplatives. The life is too active. There is too much to do.\\" (Pg. 389) Nevertheless, he later added, \\"America is discovering the contemplative life.\\" (Pg. 414)Those who like the \\"early\\" Merton expressed in this book tend not to like the later, more politically-conscious, more inclusive Merton---and vice versa. But it was the same person who wrote both \\"early\\" and \\"late\\" books---albeit one in a process of evolution. In any case, this book remains fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Seven Storey Mountain","review":"If you want all the details, this autobiography delivers! And, it's an interesting page-turner, which arrived promptly at my door.B. Davenport"},{"Title":"Broken Ground","review":"This is an excellent novel. The story follows Kaethe Schalk, a woman of both German and American background, back and forth through time as she travels back to Berlin in search for her adult daughter. It is told mainly from Schalk's point of view (she is writing to her daughter), with small bits jumping in from her daughter and her landlady. The novel is historically astute, encompassing the tensions between East and West, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the tensions between the classes and lack thereof in her American background. The story is about memories and misremembering -- the writing pulls you in to feel that you are remembering them, even though you don't know the memory until you've read it. But you feel the immediacy, that you are tasting each memory, the taste and smell bringing you back to your own childhood. Maristed's descriptions are perfect -- they pull in the past to tell the whole story -- a seamless way of telling an historical and political story in an extremely human and beautifully well-written way. The beauty of the story, spanning technically one generation, but really three, and using a very real setting for universal themes.I can only compare it to Thomas Mann's &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; -- but it would not be subtitled &quot;The Decline of a Family&quot; -- perhaps &quot;The Decline of (a) Life.&quot; Sweet, beautiful, horrible life and how we deal with its problems -- all in beautiful poetic prose.A perfect literary novel. I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Broken Ground","review":"Although the plot is intriguing, the real appeal of Kai Maristed's work is in her feel for language, sensitivity to psychological nuance, and, oddly, her muscularity of thinking. She's a fabulous writer, and it's a scandal that she is not better known."},{"Title":"Broken Ground","review":"I picked up a copy of this book on the advice of a friend, and it was wonderful...a serious novel that read like a detective story, I would recommend this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Broken Ground","review":"Broken Ground is a high-spirited disturbing novel of Berlin from the fifties to 'reunification'. The reader enters into lives on both sides of the Wall: a contemporary reincarnation of a Jewish literary salon diva, The chief of the Stasi, an American daughter and German granddaughter of a post-war spymaster, separated by history, seeking each other under the glitter of the new city.You think of the Cold War from a geopolitical perspective but Broken Ground takes you inside, helping you to imagine what life was like \\"on the ground\\" by telling this story. Highly recommended for any Cold War buff!"},{"Title":"Broken Ground","review":"I am an admirer of Kai Maristed's work. She is a terrific writer who makes you share the emotions of her characters. She paints vivid verbal portraits of people and landscapes of places, sometimes, as in this novel especially, surreal."},{"Title":"Broken Ground","review":"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Kai Maristed's Broken Ground-- and it is a remarkable novel in every way-- is the completeness with which the narrative reflects the writer's experience of Germany. Scenes set there-- whether in the East Berlin of nearly fifty years ago, or in the Federal Republic, or more recently, in re-unified Germany-- ring with authenticity. Names, details of daily life, colors, smells-- everything is there on every page. Against this backdrop, the fictional characters are intensely real.On another level, the \\"feel\\" is there-- whether of the totalitarian East or the relaxed, and more traditional West. While the narrative centers on the experience of one woman, Kaethe Schalk, one finds at the same time marvelously realized accounts of family life, of marriage, of love affairs, of estrangement, and most of all of the journey we all undertake toward the discovery of meaning. In between, one finds espionage, a relentless search for a lost family member, riot, and nearly everything else one can think of.In this anniversary year of \\"the fall of the Wall,\\" the reader interested in learning of the German experience could do no better than to read Broken Ground."},{"Title":"Alexander Hamilton Portrait in Paradox","review":"John C. Miller's biography of Alexander Hamilton is an excellent read. Miller goes through Hamilton's life from the West Indies to his death at the hands of Aaron Burr i 1804. Hamilton, a man of intense ambition and ego, emerges as a brilliant and flawed man. Hamilton was a proponent of strong central government, had no faith in ordinary people, and believed the wealthy were meant to rule. Miller brings out all of these views and provides good commentary. He outlines Hamilton's proposed government at the Constitutional Convention: an executive and senate appointed for life, the executive with an absolute veto, governors and judges appointed by the executive for life, with an absolute veto over their assemblies. If you want to see the real Hamilton this is the biography."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"This is a great book. It is a book you can read through, it reads better than any other text book I have read. It is not like most physics text books. If you are looking for just formulas and problems to plug and chug you need to look somewhere else, this is a far deeper book than that. This is for people that actually want a solid backbone in physics learn the how and why, understand the concepts. The problems in this volume can be pretty difficult, but the information to solve them are in the chapter, The book makes you think for your self. The questoins are structured so you can not memorize problem types and the equations to plug and chug, they test understanding. The result of this approch is you are far better positioned to handle physics problems that you have never seen before, where people that just want plug and chug fall apart on problems they have never seen.If you are taking a class with this book and problems are assigned from the book and you have not read the book and you want to just pick information you need to solve the problem... its not easy finding information in the book, you have to read it.This book and Vol 2 which I highly recommend also have taught me the most about physics... before this book and I was asked a Physics question that was &quot;why&quot; oriented alot of the time I would be I dont know I just know this is the formula you use. Now I know alot of the &quot;whys&quot;.In alot of other Physics text books from chapter to chapter the information presented seems to be completely disjoint no real connection. This book connects chapter and chapter.The book does have some problems where you write computer simulations, but the language they use is free to download and pretty easy to learn compared to most programming languages. If you dont want to write the programs... you can download alot of them from the authors website to look over.There are different versions of this book out there, sometime in 2003 they re-printed and fixed some errors in vol 1 and vol 2... I think the ISBN number was changed when this happened... I would check with the publishers website to make sure you are purchasing the most upto date version.I have the old versions before the re-print with corrections... and I am going to go buy the new re-prints, normally I would not bother, but the two volumes are such great books.From the Physics classes I took with the two volumes, the people that did not like this book were people that did not want to understand the subject they just wanted to be able to memorize types of problems and the equations to plug and chug. They did not want to read the book, they just wanted through the class with the least amount of effect, understanding was not a priority."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"While some of the examples in the text need to be fleshed out a bit, and the problems at the end the of the chapters are somewhat too oriented toward programming problems, on the whole I am finding this to be an extraordinary text. I am teaching it to freshman physics majors, and even those who've had significant high school physics (includng AP) have never really seen a physics course like this, and it seems to be keeping them excited. Unlike the standard freshman college texts, which simply reiterate the high school curriculum at a slightly higher level (and makes them do blocks on planes and pulleys ad nauseum), Matter and Interaction introduces classical mechanics alongside modern, alongside relativity. I have also found it a useful jumping-off point to discuss oscillators and circuits. Though the authors will need to do a bit of fine-tuning in future editions, I highly recommend this as an excellent freshman physics curriculum."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"I've used this text for my calculus-based intro physics course since before it was officially available (since fall 1999). There is no other text like it. The emphases on estimation, programming, and real world problems (as opposed to sanitized plug and chug problems) make for a VERY different experience for students and instructors alike. In my opinion, the highlight of Volume I is the treatment of energy concepts in chapters 4-6. No other text is as meticulous with terminology as this one. Instructors will have to rethink what and how they were first taught about this material. Volume I culminates in showing how mechanics and thermodynamics are united via statistical mechanics, and the approach is extraordinary. Students using this text will be better prepared for future courses than their peers who use the traditional texts; there is research to back this up. The authors provide unrivaled user support too."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"I had the privilege of learning freshmen physics from the authors.

Although the exercises are nontraditional, I find them to be more insightful than simple &quot;plug and chug&quot; problems."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"i used this textbook in an intro physics course...while it more or less explains basic concepts sufficiently, it is grossly lacking in terms of applying concepts to even the homework problems at the end of each chapter. while i'm not asking to have my hand held through each and every problem, i think this textbook expects students to be able to solve unreasonably difficult problems given the depth in which it covers the material, and the associated lectures."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"The first volume of Matter and Interactions differs from the bulk of calculus-based physics texts in that it focuses on building a conceptual, atom-by-atom model of Newtonian mechanics. Hence the subtitle \\"modern\\": it's still Newton's Laws at the center, but the authors make sure that you don't get there without seeing the theory of special relativity, quantum energy levels, and determinism first.This is this book's blessing... and its flaw as well. If you've seen physics from a more conventional 'which formula do I use' standpoint, like in a high-school course, you'll realize shortly into this text that much of what you learned was unnecessary, as it comes from only a few basic principles. However, the problems at the back of the text are as hard as other reviewers claim. Many of them require you to derive results and prove theorems for general situations as opposed to perform computations with specific numbers - and the problems that involve numerical computations are often meant to be done by making assumptions and approximations or writing computer programs. Sure, this does promote a more creative approach to physics, but I constantly found myself lost because the book doesn't provide all the tools you'll need. Lectures didn't help either, but that's a different story.You'll get the most out of this text if you've taken physics before, as you will constantly have to rethink the nature of what you previously learned. However, I can forsee physics neophytes being confused unless they happen to have an outstanding professor or TA.Don't fear, though. The second volume of this text takes a significantly different approach to electricity and magnetism that is far more self-contained."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"This book does a horrible and insufficient job of introducing the student to physics. The book lacks examples to help understand the concepts. And because our authors dont have enough time to write up a solutions manual to their difficult problems we never gain an understanding on solving problems only partly understanding the theoretical."},{"Title":"Matter and Interactions I: Modern Mechanics","review":"In my freshman physics class we used this book.

This is entirely insufficient for learning physics. It helps not only to grasp the concepts of physics, but understand the mathematics that underly those concepts.

Mr. Tozer continually reminded us of the cost of being a true disciple.

Later becoming a Roman Catholic has not dampened my thankfulness for the work this great teacher did in drawing me into a closer and real relationship with my risen Lord.

They turn out to be truly quality productions with great characters and complex storylines. Of all, Tilly Trotter is perhaps my favorite character. The movie only covers the first book of the trilogy. I wish they would produce the sequels. The US titles are Tilly, Tilly Wed, and Tilly Alone. They're all equally engaging and moving stories. We watch Tilly from a young girl, targeted by ignorant villagers and labeled a witch all because she has that charisma that draws all men. Wherever she goes tragedy seem to follow her.

His story-telling is factual, dramatic and intriguing!"},{"Title":"Opening and Closing: Closures","review":"This book has fascinating ideas on how to take every day closures and turn them into an intergral part of the garment rather than just a functional necessity.Good explainations of how to incorporate unusual and non standard closures into garments before they are cut out. Directions are adequate and pictures good for closure but a full garment picture with inset of closure would be more effective. Full garments were on TV program and really showed how these closures were such a part of the total that they did not stand out as closures.Book is excellent and shows what can be done with a little imagination, recycling unusual small objects and basic to advanced sewing skills. A book for anyone who appreciates the unusual and loves to sew."},{"Title":"Opening and Closing: Closures","review":"Like to sew? Like to make a signature work? This book has how to make buttons, ties, closures, cords and all in a very exciting way. Though some of the pictures seem dated (80's over-the-top ornamentation) and though this book is in black and white except for some opening large photographs, this will stimulate your creativity.People who should read this: those doing polymer clay ornamentation and jewelry, people interested in creative bookbinding and scrapbooking (why? Ideas for novel closures apply to books as well as jackets.) Also handweavers, who are looking for unique ways to make their craft stand out at craft fairs. Also of course anyone who sews their own clothes or designs clothes for sale. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Opening and Closing: Closures","review":"Pure inspration because the closures themselves are inspired. And, while they bring an aura of couture to your garments they are very doable. The techniques used are not 'cute', but sophisticated and artful.

An older book, there are no color photos but the black and whites beautifully capture the various applications and are lovely to behold. I recommend this book to artists and sewists of all levels."},{"Title":"Opening and Closing: Closures","review":"I ordered a used and out of print sewing book for my wife.

It has had a profound effect on most large firms and many smaller firms. This structured approach to managing the inherently risky and complex cross-functional process of new product introduction has become a staple of MBA programs. Five stages and approval gates are used to manage the funnel from idea generation/discovery to project scoping to business case to development to testing/validation to launch/post-launch review.The third edition text outlines the basic structure. It provides best practices and practical advice for each stage. The author emphasizes the importance of speed and ways to use the stage-gate approach to deliver timely results, addressing the common criticism that the stage-gate process is inherently inflexible and slow. The 6 F's approach includes flexibility, fuzzy gates, fluidity, focus, facilitation and forever green. The basic risks of an overly rigid gate system are addressed, perhaps over-addressed. There is no in-depth treatment or review of alternate approaches to new product development that make time to market the primary focus.A significant amount of survey research is presented to define product introduction pitfalls and critical success factors. None of this is surprising, but the many lists provide a framework for product management practitioners to evaluate the effectiveness of their processes.The book provides several useful decision-making frameworks, including marketing/technology success factors, new to company/market, risks through time, risk/reward grids, gate decisions, and portfolio reviews.Overall, this is the best new product intro text available. It is addressed to marketing oriented product managers in large corporations, but is useful for anyone playing a role in a new product introduction process.The author promotes a high investment approach to new product development, best fitting a Fortune 200 firm. There are 5 stages, 5 gates, 6 F's, 7 goals, 8 points, 8 key factors and 15 critical success factors. Professor Cooper does not believe in shortcuts.Start with the stage-gate basics in chapter 5. Digest the other chapters as the need arises."},{"Title":"Winning at New Products - Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch (3rd, 01) by Cooper, Robert G [Paperback (2001)]","review":"An excellent job of Stage-Gates.

As a result, many companies have been very successful at generating new innovations. However, generating innovations is just the first step and an excess of innovations in many companies has created a need for good management processes to deal with them. These are the issues addressed by this book and there may be no other place where these issues are addressed as thoroughly and well as here. The author provides a thorough review and analysis of each step of the development process from idea to commercial launch. While the book can be slow reading at times, I firmly believe the author's method of separating the process into stages and providing screening mechanisms between the stage are excellent advice. Following these methods should lead to: (1) accelerated product development, (2) increased success rate of new products, and (3) a more effective and efficient new products development process. Accordingly, the book should be especially useful to those managers responsible for portfolios of new products. If this is you, this book is highly recommended.STRENGTHS: The book provides a very thorough review and analysis of the new product development process from innovation through to launch. The author has done a very thorough review of the research in this field and the book does an excellent job of citing other material. The book also contains an appropriate use of graphics for illustrating some points.WEAKNESSES: While the book doesn't focus on any particular industry, its teachings are probably most applicable to more traditional product companies (e.g. P&amp;G, DuPont). Also, (and this maybe an unfair comment for a book targeted at products) the book probably isn't that helpful for innovations in services which may be even more important in modern companies than product innovation (e.g. GE and IBM are currently pushing services). Another concern, the book is fairly &quot;textbook like&quot; and only those seriously interested in the subject may find it easy/enjoyable to read. Some passages seem to drag on and I often wished the author would have been more concise and not tried to so thoroughly justify every point.WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: Product development managers, new business managers, and others responsible for bringing innovations to market should read this book. Those responsible for _portfolios_ of new products/innovations may especially find this book useful.ALSO CONSIDER: Jeffrey A Timmons - New Venture Creation; Guy Kawasaki - Rules for Revolutionaries; Peter F. Drucker - Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship"},{"Title":"Winning at New Products - Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch (3rd, 01) by Cooper, Robert G [Paperback (2001)]","review":"Bob Cooper, the author of this book, is the originator of the stage-gate approach to new product development, and is recognized as such by the federal government who registered this phrase under his company. He initially described the approach in a couple of excellent articles written in the late 1970s but this book, first written in the late 1980s and updated twice since, is really the best source for the stage-gate process. Although his writing can be dry and his tone preachy, you can't argue with the base information and the conclusions. He studied 3000 new products in hundreds of companies to identify what separates the winners from the losers in new products, and stage-gates are one of the keys, along with cross-functional teams and a clear understanding of the customer's needs. Today over 96% of companies in a recent survey use stage-gates, and the best at bringing new products to market, the organizations that are the most profitable and growing the fastest, do it well. This book lays out how to do it well. If you want to install a stage-gate process, and you need to, if your company doesn't have one, this is your best source."},{"Title":"Winning at New Products - Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch (3rd, 01) by Cooper, Robert G [Paperback (2001)]","review":"New products accelerate consumerism and a truly innovative launch can re-ignite corporate balance sheets, but new product attrition is high. For every seven new product ideas floated, about four enter development, one and a half are launched and only one succeeds (25% to 45% of new products flop). Yet intrepid corporations innovate and live to recount their tales to happy shareholders. The book presents every conceivable detail of the launch process - evaluation, management, best practices, game plans and even the seemingly impossible, incorporating new ideas into corporate thinking. So, what are the shortcomings? Well, there's not enough service industry info and there is too much redundancy. Processes are listed, sub-processes are listed and sub-sub-processes, until the reader gets lost in lists and stages. Still, if you retain the energy to try, this book provides the theoretical and operational framework for launching new products. All you need is that billion dollar idea.

I did not expected too much from the book, but it was better than I expected, except for some parts of it.The book broadly consists of three different parts. The first provides a background, the second provides guidelines for stage-gate and the last looks at strategy.The first four chapters try to convince the reader that new products and Robert Coopers ideas (stage-gate and the product he sells) are very good ideas. It's full of research 'evidence', but it seems to be coming from the same few sources. Also some of the conclusions from the research evidence are somewhat far fetched, in my opinion. Anyways, it did contain some useful information, like the effort spend on market research in early phases of a product is often not enough.The second part occupies most of the book and looks at the different stages in the stage-gate process. The focus of the book is actually NOT so much on the product development itself, but mainly on the marketing and product management aspect. This is important to realize, if you wanted a book on product development, you better look at other books like Don Reinertsens \\"Managing the Design Factory\\". Chapter 8 is a sidetrack chapter which talks about portfolio management. Chapter 10 is suppose to talk about the lat stage, but instead it seems to be a summary of the marketing issues needed throughout the whole development, which makes me wonder a little about the things that actually need to be done on the last stage.Some of the problems I had and have with stage-gate is that it does provide a very serial view on developing products. First start with marketing and \\"nail down the spec\\". Hand it over to development and then do testing. Cooper tries to explain that this is not the case, but it is very hard to make that conclusion when, on the next page, he says \\"nail down the spec before the development starts.\\" He sometimes doesn't seem to know what he is actually advising. In that sense, the book did not convince me at all that stage-gate is a good idea, especially in fast cycle time products and software development.The last chapter covered strategy, but did so in a very minor way. It was still useful to include it to make the book one whole.I actually liked Coopers book. It had a strong marketing focus and I learned from that. I do not agree with some of the ideas Cooper has and also his references seem to be limited. Though, his writing style is absolutely awful. It's so popular! He uses exclamation marks every other sentence! Writes in absolutes! It really annoyed me!I thinking between 3 and 4 stars. Its certainly not \\"the product development bible\\" as Cooper claims himself. I decided to go for three stars mainly because of his annoying writing style and because the book could be written in 1/4th the amount of pages (a lot of blah blah). If you read one book on product development, this is not it. If you want to study the area more broadly, this book certainly needs to be included."},{"Title":"Winning at New Products - Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch (3rd, 01) by Cooper, Robert G [Paperback (2001)]","review":"I agree with the review by Bas Vodde. This is a good book, but it is very repetitive and could have been written in half the space. The writing style does reflect that of a professor and not a story teller. A difficult read, but worth the time and money. A definite requirement for your NPD library and for the NPDP certification exam. Some books that I found to be more useful are: the PDMA Handbook, and New Products Mgt by Crawford. Also read Dr. Coopers papers on the same subject. They are more useful and direct to the point. Go to the Stage-Gate website, under the \\"knowledge\\" section to download them for free. Also refer to the PDMA-NPDP list of suggested readings & publications.Also, \\"Accelerating the process\\" is in the title, but it is a practice that is actually not recommended by this author or others. Accelerating typically implies skipping steps, which is NOT recommended. Instead, read the chapter on speeding up NPD in the PDMA handbook. Co-development is one strategy. I suspect that Cooper put the word \\"acceleration\\" in the title to create more sales of this book. Too many managers want results now. Fast, fast, fast... no time to do it right. They don't realize that true innovation takes time. But with a good process, like Stage-Gate and Portfolio management, the process will by default, become more focused and stream-lined, and success will grossly over-shadow speed to market. That is why this is a good book because Stage-Gate is a great process. But the word \\"accelerating\\" can be misleading to many. Not much info in this book to speed things up. Instead, follow the process step by step to increase the probablity of success."},{"Title":"Winning at New Products - Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch (3rd, 01) by Cooper, Robert G [Paperback (2001)]","review":"The book introduces the Stage-Gate process by its author. The Stage-Gate is a process for disciplined innovation used to move ideas to commercial products. The process basically divides the new product process into five main stages: Scoping, Building Business Case, Development, Testing and Validation, and Launch. Before each Stage there is a Gate that opens the door for more investment and commitment. The process seems common sense at first but the research and studies behind it flesh it out with invaluable tips and checklists that build your confidence to adopt them in your own domain. The book is full of diagrams, tables and charts that help you understand important studies and concepts.On the downside, I found little details on the Gates, the focus is primarily on the Stages. I also think the book is little bit lengthy for the amount of wisdom embedded, I found many of the concepts repeated throughout, some might consider this a plus as it helps emphasizing the concepts. I also think that some of the the studies should have been moved to an appendix to make the reading flow smoother. . Finally, the book could have been structured differently; for example, chapter 12 (Product Innovation and Technology Strategy) and chapter 8 (Portfolio Management) could have been (at least partially) moved earlier in the book.Overall, I think the book is a great value, I found it useful as my first product management reading, it is easy to read and follow.The book is a recommended reading by the Product Management Association."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Professional Dog Trainer","review":"I have been researching dog training programs all week and stumbled across the site dogproblems dot com.

The one from 2006 made a single review, for this book, and gave it five stars. Fishy at best. I'm glad I did my due diligence before falling for his ruse because I got suckered by a similar scheme a few years ago buying what i thought was an e-book on solar power, and I like to have never gotten the charges stopped stopped & my money back. Thankfully one of my best friends is a judge and wrote a couple of letters for me in his capacity as an attorney. It was resolved within 10 days. But most people don't have a judge for a best friend from whom they can get free legal help so be very careful when considering dealing with this type of scheme.My opinion is deal with established, reputable dog trainers for whom many reviews by REAL people can be found online - and not a marketer like this guy obviously is.

I learned that it is all about communicating with your dog in a way they can understand, which is different from human reasoning. The positive and negative association tricks are so simplistic that I really thought my dogs would see right through, but I soon realized that they are still dogs no matter how bright they seem.I also learned that you can teach an old dog with bad habits new tricks. My dog was 8 years old and stubborn when I began to train her and she responded quite well. I can now run with my two well trained dogs and enjoy their companionship.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering getting a dog or feels their current dog needs improvement.

By accepting that so-called deal, you're agreeing to enroll in a Web discount program that's run by a completely separate company. Those programs, which have innocuous names such as \\"Reservation Rewards,\\" \\"Travel Values Plus,\\" or \\"Great Fun,\\" often provide a 30-day trial period during which you get discounts on a variety of merchandise and services.

In some cases, they advocate almost abusive practices to train your dog. I read about 75 pages of it and threw it out. There's a difference between being the Alpha Dog to train the dog and just plain hurting your dog in the hopes that it trains him (and hoping that he doesn't retaliate and attack you when you train him this way.)He calls various breeds \\"stupid\\" and says they are pretty much un-trainable. Nice.Further, two years later I realize that they've been siphoning money from my bank account every month. I signed up to buy this book and no where on the main web page or checkout page did it say that they'd be charging me $15 a month for the rest of my life.Here's how it works: No where on the webpage does it clearly say they'll be taking this money out of your account. When you check out, they ask you to click a box to show you have read the \\"terms of agreement,\\" a seperate page full of legal jargon. Hidden at the bottom of the legally terms of agreement is a line that says they're going to charge you $15 a month to access the website. Of course they don't make this clear when you're checking out. You have to take extra steps to find this out yourself.This is so stupid. I wanted a training book. They've been taking small amounts of money out of my debit account for over a year, so I didn't even notice it. I've now reported it to my bank."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Professional Dog Trainer","review":"Before I dive in the material, let me just say that through the years as a dog owner, I learned that every dog is different and there is no one sure way of training that applies to all dogs. The most effective way for me, is to learn as many different techniques as I can and apply those that do work on my dog.Because simply owning a dog doesn't establishes you as the leader, at least as far as the dog is concerned. Adam Katz advocates the \\"alpha-dog\\" method. His idea is that when your dog recognizes you as the leader, he/she is much more likely to listen to you and to obey your rules. The training method in this book describe things that you do or not to do, in order to establish your \\"alpha\\" position. I should note that Katz doesn't advocate beating or other harsh method.I found some of Katz's method very useful. With dog training, the devil is in the details and Katz really gets down to what to do and what to avoid. His insight like the difference between using a treat (or a ball) to train your dog (good) and to bribe your dog (bad) should be taught to all dog owners.

To think that there is one way of teaching that applies to all dogs! I wish there is such a method but there is no none. Don't treat dog training method like the gospel! I know about the clicking method and I'm sure it works for some dogs.

Lainson gives every opportunity to those who wish to better themselves. The public knows far too little about its prisons and the damage done by incompetent wardens.Lawton C. Corning visited the Cool & Lam Agency so they can locate Yvonne Wells for him. They can start with Mr. Drury Well, he husband (Chapter 2). Donald Lam questioned Mr. Wells and his neighbors, and learned what Mrs. Raleigh heard the night Mrs. Wells went away (Chapter 3). Lam checks the bus drivers and public records, but found nothing (Chapter 4). Corning does not like the results or the fact that Lam thinks it's a possible homicide (Chapter 5). But Yvonne Wells has returned home after their spat (Chapter 6). Lam visits the first Mrs. Wells in Sacramento, and her cousin Lucille. Lam learns more about the situation (Chapter 7). Next Cool & Lam are sued by Drury Wells (Chapter 8). Chapter9 explains why a witness should be careful about what they say or what they sign.Lam visits the property that was left in the will, and discovers why a dry hole in the ground could be quite valuable (Chapter 10). Lam visited where the Wells used to live and learns some interesting facts (Chapter 11). Next Lam flew to San Antonio to talk to Bedford's widow. He learns more from this other point of view (Chapter 12). Lam does some social engineering and dumpster diving to get clues (Chapter 13). He finds a model who does a lot of special jobs (Chapter 14). Corning returns and signs an agreement so they can locate Yvonne Wells, again. Now Lam has enough knowledge to contact Sergeant Frank Sellers (Chapter 15). They go to that section of land with the old cabin and deep hole in the desert. Lam calls Corning as per the agreement, but Corning is upset (Chapter 16). Sellers uses his experience to get to the bottom of the crime (Chapter 17). Chapter 18 ties up the loose ends.

Even though her daddy is accused of killing her Uncle Cade, June and PeeDee remain close friends.

Through the eyes of an innocent, young girl, one learns of the classes of people - their customs, attitudes, pleasures, and hardships - who lived in the Appalachian Mountains in the 1940's. Some of the expressions and customs were also indigenous to many parts of the rural South, such as Tennessee. The writer cleverly weaves suspense throughout and closes with an unexpected event.

Writing about Nog, Pynchon proclaimed, &quot;The novel of bull **** is dead.&quot; I thought that the book was marvelous. Wurlitzer has a field day with issues of identity, integrity and all sorts of other topics that, as far as I am concerned, were explored in a manner that was much more compelling during the late '60s and early '70s. The notion of a character who invents/chooses his &quot;memories&quot; tickled my fancy then as much as now. Wurlitzer has always been willing to step out into areas where other authors were either afraid or simply unwilling to follow. Try to find the video of &quot;Two Lane Blacktop&quot; if you haven't already seen it. Wurlitzer wrote the screen play and that of &quot;Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid&quot; as well. If unhealthy mental excitement is appealing to you, I would recommend this work highly. If not, save your yourself some upset and read something a bit more tame."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"Reading \\"Nog\\" is a little like living in the mind of Zen monk strung out on drugs. Whatever, whoever Nog is, I'm not sure that he's human. If a human being is one step removed from reality-having to interpret the physical world through the senses and through the mind-then Nog is about four or five steps removed. Impressions from the world come in, bounce around inside his cavernous mind and finally end up distorted beyond recognition, which is where the fun begins.Nog strives to maintain a maximum of three memories, considers facts subjective, and will not, under any circumstances, give out information. But don't get him started on the octopus...&quot;He kept complaining about a yellow light that had been streaming out of his chest from a spot the size of a half dollar. We drank and talked about the spot and the small burning sensation it gave him early in the morning and about his octopus. He had become disillusioned about traveling with the octopus and had begun having aggressive dreams about it. He wanted to sell it.&quot;Rudolph Wurlitzer's style is reminiscent of other writers of the era-Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, et cetera-and the novel's genre is the good old American \\"yarn.\\" As with Mark Twain, Wurlitzer just wants to keep pulling your leg as long as you'll let him. This sort of thing is difficult to sustain outside the confines of a short story, however-and, like some of Twain's novels, \\"Nog\\" does lose a bit of its steam somewhere. The opening of the book is absolutely priceless, but soon Wurlitzer must do something to up the ante in his narrative con game. This, unfortunately, means falling back on an listless plot to move Nog around and add fodder to that bizarre imagination. If \\"Nog\\" never quite surpasses the flair of the opening chapters, Wurlitzer has still achieved a deliciously eccentric style and created one truly unforgettable character."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"I may have been one of the first people to read this book. God knows for years I would thrust my tattered copy at friends and insist they read it. My best friend and I still use phrases in conversation that we picked up from the book 20 years ago (&quot;hasten a focus&quot; comes to mind). For some reason I even remember the moment I purchased the book, in paperback, in a Woolworth's back in 1970, mostly because of its &quot;psychedelic&quot; cover art and the promise that &quot;Nog is to literature what Dylan is to music.&quot; After a single, futile attempt at reading it, I found it on the shelf in my old bedroom at my parents' house one day in 1974, and noted that a glowing blurb from my favorite author, Thomas Pynchon, graced its back cover. If there is a message in &quot;Nog&quot;, it may be: mental illness and hallucinogens are probably not a very good combination. Then again, there's more to &quot;Nog&quot; then meets the eye."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"After being badgered by the Casa Marina Reading Club in the late '70's to read this (resulting in my subsequent slide into Nog-like obscurity), I can state with some experience that this book exerts an influence on its readers. Rumors abound that Wurlitzer was an itinerant goat herder who strived to simplify his life: to date these rumors are unsubstantiated. However, there is evidence that \\"Nog\\" is an influence in the writings of Thomas Pynchon and Christopher Moore. Chuck Norris has been known to quote significant passages from the book in some of his Westerns and credits the book with his zen-like approach to martial arts. A good read - and a way of life."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"There were very few exemplary novels to come out of the 1960s: maybe &quot;The Crying of Lot 49,&quot; by Pynchon, &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me,&quot; by Richard Farina [which unfortunately has not worn well], &quot;Twilight Candelabra,&quot; by William J. Craddock [okay, I'm not completely serious here], and the best one of all, the one that social anthropologists should consult when trying to make sense of that mad decade -- &quot;Nog.&quot;Wurlitzer went off to Hollywood soon after, and certainly never achieved this kind of inspired prose again -- though &quot;Flats&quot; influenced Sam Shepard a great deal, and &quot;Slow Fade&quot; has its moments, but more recently he seems burned out.&quot;Nog&quot; is the quintessential &quot;stoner&quot; novel of all time. As such it's a significant document; more importantly perhaps, it's endlessly entertaining and diverting. Wurlitzer was here as original as anyone writing in English since WWII."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"Nog was one of those books that taught me more about writing at the time than all my college courses lumped together. I remember buying this book in its Pocket Books incarnation in the autumn of 1970. The book cost me $.95 cents brand spanking new, but, as they claim on the Master Card commercials, the experience is priceless. I stayed up all night reading the book and raving to my roommates the following morning. One read it; the other demurred. Simply put, it is one of the great classics, not just of an era but in modern American Lit. I still have that original copy of Nog. I handle it with care."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"Combine Donald Barthelme (how about The Dead Father), the more benign elements of William S. Burroughs (oh, let's say, the chapter &quot;Shift Coordinate Points&quot; from Nova Express), throw in a pinch of Alaine Robbe-Grillet (hmmm... maybe Project for a Revolution in New York or Last Year at Marienbad), beat well, simmer over a low psilocybin flame, then serve in a small, locked, pitch dark room, with a only tiny square window high up in the door, set R. D. Laing outside the door to intone &quot;grace&quot; over the whole business, and you've got &quot;Nog&quot; --or something like it. There is no discernible &quot;plot&quot; or &quot;point&quot; to the &quot;story&quot; to speak of, just hallucinatory narration from a seemingly disembodied mind that seems to have woken up in a storage room in some nameless and bizarre house or is trying to wake up from some tripped-out nightmare but can't quite pull it off. There's an octopus, or some concept of an octopus, that creeps in now and then, and &quot;conversations&quot; with faceless and nameless persons beyond the confines of the narrator's (Nog's)&quot;world.&quot; Don't worry: there aren't any &quot;spoilers&quot; in this review.&quot;Nog&quot; starts out intriguing, but then becomes contrived and tiresome after the first 50 pages (luckily, it's a relatively short book)when, hoping against hope, you realize that, indeed, &quot;this isn't going anywhere.&quot; The prose has it's interesting moments, deft turns of phrase here and there, but, ultimately fizzles. Worse yet, it's not even funny. I read this book for the first time, 12 years ago, when I was recuperating from a major bout of the flu. &quot;Nog&quot; made absolutely no sense, but I chalked it up to my fever-addled brain. I tried reading it again, recently, thinking time and a prior read would offer some kind of Rosetta Stone for this puzzle. No dice. In fact, &quot;Nog&quot; was even less understandable.Bottom line: This was an interesting experiment that was in harmony with the &quot;oh wow, it's art!&quot; absurdist sensibilities of the late 60's when it was written. It's really more of a curiosity than any serious effort at literature. Now, if you're a serious student of the psychedelic era, &quot;Nog&quot; deserves a read, if only to take you to the outer boundaries of a literary genre we probably won't see again."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"I read this book when it first came out and saw, for the first time, that it was possible to find language for what the world had become.I remain utterly grateful."},{"Title":"Nog;: A novel","review":"Coming out at the end of the 1960's, it is a tempting mistake to put this book with what was just about to ahhpen anyway--and it is too bad that mor ethings like this did not go on. I see a continuation--not a throwback--to such delerious yet clear works as Eater of Darkness, The Journal of Albion Moonlight, Doctor Faustroll--before the Beats weighed down the novel of spontanaeity and surprise--and after they did Rudolph Wylitzer proved that it could still be done right with Nog. This is a really remarkable book--the narrator has the same hilarious hysteria that Ishmael has at the beginning of Moby Dick--and carries it through to the end, more or less (no spoilers here!)--the writing never stops being surprising, and it is at turns lyrical, absurd, poigniant, puzzling--and suddenly clear as sky for a line or two. Though the narrator never has--nor wants--more than a passing understanding fo what is really going on, the reader never lacks a story, no matter what bizzare items get tossed out of the trick top hat on the way.

The book covers all the action seen by Mr. Grider and includes exciting descriptions of attacking Japanese ships and humorous situations that occurred in submarine life. I don't know if Mr. Grider is still alive but from this book I know he is a man of integrity and courage. I would have liked to met him.

In the current instance, his own family is involved - not just one of the regiment of cousins scattered up and down the country, but his cousin Cecily, whose father is the closest thing Frank has to his own late father.Before anyone gets the wrong impression, Cecily is already married, although she separated from her husband Grant a few months after the wedding and won't say why. The reader and Grant have an extra piece of information - she's convinced he married her for her money - but we, at least, don't know why. Cecily, as the only member of the family with whom old Lady Evelyn Abbott *didn't* quarrel, seems to be the unlucky one. Money hasn't brought her happiness, especially given the other part of her inheritance - the old lady's belief that everyone close to you will eventually turn out to be after your money.In the end - or rather, the beginning - it isn't Cecily who's murdered, and the motive doesn't seem to be money - not directly. Mary Stokes, a not-so-nice-girl, doesn't seem to be lying when she says she found a corpse in the woods wearing eternity earrings, but the cops can't find it. Most likely, it ties up with the disappearance of Louise Rogers, a penniless refugee in these post-WWII days, who was looking for the British soldier who stole everything she had during the war. If she found him, there aren't many suspects that she could have met...We are given a much better insight into Abbott's character and background: why he joined the police force instead of reading law, and why he has such a wide sardonic streak. (Ironically enough, he even looks like Lady Evelyn.)"},{"Title":"Eternity Ring","review":"This wasn't the best Miss Silver mystery that I've read. First of all we hardly see Miss Silver at all, and she isn't the one who actually solves this case. A lot of the action takes place without her presence. Since I read Miss Silver to see her sharp mind in action, that was a disappointment. Also, the mystery wasn't too hard to figure out, so maybe they didn't need Miss Silver's razor-sharp intelligence for this one. It starts with a village woman seeing a man dragging what was obviously a dead woman's body in the night, but there was no body to find afterwards, so no one really believed her until she turns up dead too. Frank and Miss Silver set out to find the first woman's body. As in all Miss Silver books there is a love interest, but this has a bit of a twist since it involves a separated married couple. A bit disappointing, this one."},{"Title":"Eternity Ring","review":"Published just a few years after the end of World War II, time has not diminished the capacity of this well-written murder mystery to entertain the reader. Featuring Miss Maud Silver, a retired governess turned private inquiry agent, it is replete with interesting characters and an array of suspects. While the discerning reader will probably be able to figure out just who the killer is, this will not dim the enjoyment of the reader in getting to that point, as it is the journey that that counts.Detective Sergeant Frank Abbott of Scotland Yard is visiting relatives in the English countryside in a village called Deeping. While there, Mary Stokes, a local woman, hysterically reports seeing a dead woman murdered just outside the village in an area of woods known as Dead Man's Copse. Unfortunately, as investigation fails to corroborates the young woman's story. Something just does not make sense.Detective Sergeant Abbot asks Miss Silver if would come for a visit to the village in an unofficial capacity, as he reveres her insights, and she readily acquiesces. When a woman is later reported missing, and the description of the missing woman ties in with the description of the woman that Mary Stokes reported murdered, the only questions that remain are where is the body and who killed her?This is an intricately plotted murder mystery with well-drawn characters. There are also a number of intriguing sub-plots. All gets neatly woven together in a most enjoyable and satisfying mystery. Miss Silver, as always, brings much to the table in her own way and is the recurring character in a series of mysteries of which I am a devoted fan. Those who like murder mysteries, as well as those who are fans of Miss Silver, will thoroughly enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Eternity Ring","review":"I've been reading the Miss Silver series in order. This is the 13th book of 32, written when the author was about 70. She has an impressive track record for creating stand-alone mysteries, even though they're in a series, and for finding fresh ways to view her basic set-up. In each book, whether in London or the English countryside, there are a bunch of people with old and new secrets, a murder (not graphic), and Miss Silver on hand to untangle the stories. In this entry, Miss Silver doesn't play much of a role, but there is plenty of compensation in the introduction of Frank Abbott's family and the revelation of some of his background. As always, a young couple finds obstacles on the path to lasting happiness and the main obstacle in this case is a rather foolish one, but never mind. It's an enjoyable book. After going through a dozen of these novels, I'm a bit tired of all the oppressive Victorian and Edwardian furnishings, the poor taste (by modern standards) in clothing, and the simply awful food. But that may be my own fault for reading so many in a row! I've really become addicted to them and am already dreading the day when I've read the last volume. Luckily, Patricia Wentworth wrote many other books and I may turn to those for solace."},{"Title":"Eternity Ring","review":"I love the Miss Silver mysteries.

The corpse is wearing a very distinctive earring which looks like a diamond eternity ring but the second earring appears to be missing. It is not Frank's case and he was only there are the time because he was staying with his uncle and aunt. He is puzzled and asks his friend Miss Silver to come and stay and see if she thinks the girl is lying.What follows is an intriguing mystery which may or may not involve Frank's cousin Cicely and her estranged husband, Grant Hathaway as well as many of the neighbours. It is thanks to Miss Silver that the missing corpse is eventually discovered but not until another murder has taken place and there are even more suspects in the frame.I think this is one of Patricia Wentworth's best Miss Silver mysteries featuring as it does her working in harmony with the police and making best use of her ability to fade into the background and be overlooked just when an intelligent listener is needed.

Kerr books as a teen in the 70s and this, along with \\"Dinky Hocker\\", is one that stuck with me the best. The narrator, Flanders, has been sent off to a girl's boarding school because her mother has run off with another man and Flanders is \\"in the way\\". At the boarding school, Flanders meets all kinds of characters including her impoverished and cynical friend Cardmaker; a gorgeous hillbilly girl from a nouveau riche family; another gorgeous girl who is deaf and incredibly loud; and Miss Blue, a reclusive teacher who spends a lot of time visiting with a large portrait of \\"her pal\\" Jesus. Flanders eventually develops an odd attachment to Miss Blue, who may be eccentric, but is at least quietly eccentric.Although this book doesn't have much of a consistent theme or plot, and may be a little arcane to those of us who haven't attended boarding schools, there are some very hilarious parts - many years later I can still remember how hard I laughed at the chapter where the girls attend a school dance. Cardmaker's dyed formal stains her neck blue and Flanders gets a crush on a gorgeous rich boy who's the equivalent of Jethro from Beverly Hillbillies and talks about steaks as big as \\"toilet seats\\". Religion and belief in God come into play in the book, as the hypocritical school authorities (the school is nominally Episcopal) disapprove of the \\"atheist club\\" started by some of the girls but also disapprove of the seemingly genuine and personal faith of Miss Blue. Miss Blue is perhaps an even more interesting character in the 2000's than she was in the 1970s for the simple reason that she professes her religious faith quietly, personally and a little eccentrically, in contrast to today's evangelical styles.As with Tucker in \\"Dinky Hocker\\", Flanders is presented as the more \\"normal\\" foil to the wackier students and teachers all around her and it's likely that some readers will relate to her feelings of loneliness and insecurity. I personally didn't relate but I still thought it was an OK book."},{"Title":"Is That You Miss Blue?","review":"Is That You Miss. Blue? is a mediocre book about a young girl named Flanders Brown.

The whole presentation of this author via his little series of math works follows a very clear and sharp path from complex variables to general function theory. It seems many authors delay starting at the start with complex numbers and variables -- yet the \\"complex way\\" is a very streamlined way into general function theory and even infinite series -- as this Mentor shows -- starting with this very great little gem of an introduction.

The book was written by multiple authors, so it offers a variety of viewpoints but also occasionally contradicts itself.The first half of the book is especially good and is likely to be relevant to any entrepreneur. The reader is encouraged to answer some important questions that help determine exactly what they hope to achieve, both personally and professionally, through their business. One useful section assists with the creation of the business plan, and an even more useful section warns the reader not to spend so much time planning that they miss their opportunity entirely.Unfortunately, a large portion of the book deals with venture capital. If your business plan involves venture capital, the information in the book will undoubtedly be of use to you. However, one of the last chapters of the book deals with \\"bootstrap finance\\" and points out that an exceedingly small number of start-ups actually need or receive venture capital. The final section, concerning \\"commercializing technology\\", is also unlikely to apply to most small businesses.I'm glad I had a chance to read this book, but I think other books will prove more useful to the typical entrepreneur (NOLO's Legal Guide for Starting & Running a Small Business is particularly good)."},{"Title":"Harvard Business Review on Entrepreneurship (Harvard Business Review Paperback Series)","review":"As an entrepreneur with varying degree of success and failure, I found this book to be the most accurate writing on the subject.

All of these chapters are especially well-written and convey practical information that will enhance the likelihood of success for any start-up entrepreneur. The legendary venture capitalist Arthur Rock also contributes a chapter that contains valuable information.

However, better development on preparing business plans for financing and better examples for these plans."},{"Title":"Harvard Business Review on Entrepreneurship (Harvard Business Review Paperback Series)","review":"The \\"Harvard Business Review\\" series collects some of the best and most thought-provoking articles by eminent thinkers on a variety of subjects and publishes it in an accessible, affordable, and useable format. This book focuses on different aspects of entrepreneurship, and contains eight articles dealing with different parts of the entrepreneur's plight.The articles are generally all quite readable and are largely immune to the academic stuffiness of some competing works. I personally found the three articles by Amar Bhide to be the best in the book, and to fully justify the cost of the book on their own. Bhide's focus on staffing and financial issues was on target, practical, and genuinely helpful.I also found William A. Sahlman's advice on writing a great business plan to be excellent and easy to put into practice; I was particularly impressed with his dictum to be realistic and honest at all times, rather than attempting to dazzle prospective investors with long range projections full of imaginary accounting data. Sahlman also discusses elements of logical deals in entrepreneurial finance, which are distilled into six excellent rules on page 47. My favorite rule is that sensible deals \\"are written on a pile of papers no greater than one-quarter-inch thick.\\" (No doubt some of his colleagues at Harvard Law School would disagree.)Noted venture capitalist Arthur Rock also writes an excellent piece focused on obtaining startup capital. I was pleased that he, like Bhide, focused on the resumes of key personnel more than financial projections. I was even more pleased to read his discussion of the dangers of hiring \\"yes men\\" in key positions (pp. 140-142,) and can wholeheartedly endorse his conclusions having personally seen that destructive force rear its ugly head earlier in my career.In reality, all of the advice in the book is quite good. The book earned four stars on the basis of the quality and real-world applicability of the information presented. My principal critique of the book is that it focuses on very capital intensive businesses (notably manufacturing,) and is more skewed toward high-dollar deals involving venture capitalists, which are a miniscule percentage of the businesses started in America every year, a point that Bhide discusses in great detail in \\"Bootstrap Finance: The Art of Start-ups.\\" Neither does the book have a lot of material relevant to service or consulting operations, a distinct drawback.On balance I recommend this book to any entrepreneur or anyone even remotely contemplating starting a business. While some parts of the book will be less relevant than others to any given business, all the information is of high quality and worthy of contemplation."},{"Title":"Harvard Business Review on Entrepreneurship (Harvard Business Review Paperback Series)","review":"If you don't have much business experience or education, this is probably worthwhile to pick up.

In this volume in particular, I would go so far as to say that I am offended by the gross accusations made of malicious, hateful and eager-to-kill behavior as exhibited by snakes, lizards, & crocodilians. The authors list comparatively benign species such as the cottonmouth and copperhead as among the more dangerous species of snakes in the world, and generally misconstrue age-old myths about reptiles.

Patty is just an ordinary person who scrapes by holding a series of menial jobs, yet she doggedly and devotedly maintains her loyalty to her husband.Is this woman a saint, or is she throwing her life away? Pregnant at the time of his incarceration she raises a boy who shows little affection toward her, and resists trips to see his father. Yet she drives long distances every week to visit her husband; visits which end up in moments of long silence when topics of conversation dry up. Her life goes by with almost no rewards.Surprisingly, the author never tells us how Patty feels about the crime that her husband has committed. Patty simply slogs on prepared to stand by him for however long it takes for him to gain his freedom. The book covers this entire period, detailing day after day of her very ordinary life.Is this waiting worth the effort? All through the book I kept putting myself in her situation. If my wife committed a serious crime and was locked up possibly for the rest of her life would I show such fortitude? At some point would I not feel that my life was being wasted? Would I not succumb to the temptation to seek comfort with other women, eventually to fall in love with one of them, and divorce my wife?You will have to read the book to see if Patty's wait was worth her extraordinary effort.This is a most unusual story. Although devoid of any excitement, plot twists or turns, it is yet a compelling tale."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"This novel goes against the grain of our expectations, and some may find it frustrating -- those who persevere may find themselves impressed and even haunted. Patty is the \\"good wife\\" whose husband Tommy is convicted of a crime and sent to prison for a LONG time. In the beginning Patty's belief in her husband's innocence seems painfully nave, and one's sympathy is with her impatient mother who thinks she should just give up and divorce him, much less continue to appeal his conviction. That plot would have produced a \\"romantic\\" and \\"exciting\\" book, more common to many \\"serious\\" novels as well as typical of many best-sellers.But Patty doesn't take the easy way out. The point of this book is not whether Tommy is guilty, or how things ultimately turn out. It is our growing involvement with Patty's struggle. She is determined to raise their son Casey in such a way that he does not reject his father. She struggles with herself, her own feelings of being robbed of a \\"normal\\" married life through no fault of her own. She struggles financially - working class women are all too familiar with the kinds of jobs that Patty has to take to pay basic living expenses, even though she saves on rent by living with family members. She succeeds in maintaining a relationship with Tommy, despite the many obstacles put in her way by the criminal justice system. Our respect and admiration for Patty grows as she just plain DEALS with the life she has - with integrity, with realism, without bitterness - and as we realize the depth of her choice to continue to love Tommy and to be faithful to him in every way. She's not a saint but she's a heroine - whose love for small satisfactions of life helps carry her through times that would finish off most of us.Stewart O'Nan has a naturalistic and poetic genius for writing about people like Patty. This is a beautifully written book whose details evoke the physical and emotional reality of the scenes. Check out his \\"Last Night at the Lobster\\" for an equally rewarding read - \\"Lobster\\" was my first O'Nan book, \\"The Good Wife\\" my second, and I plan to read them all!"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"A very good rendering of the New York State prison experience through the eyes of Patty Dickerson, the novel's title character who's left behind. I specifically recommend this book for anyone who's got a loved one in prison.I liked the author's attention to geographic detail. O'Nan sets the story in rural Tioga County, NY. The towns and back roads and buildings described are all real, as are the various prison facilities housing Patty's husband, Tommy, over the 28 years of his incarceration.I particularly liked the author's realistic portrayal of the prison visitor experience - how family and friends of inmates can be treated like dirt by the Corrections Officers. The CO's capriciously apply, or make up, various \\"rules\\" to regulate the visiting process whose only purpose is to make the visit less pleasant, or humiliating, and/or to outright deny the visit, often when the visitor has driven hours just to get there. I too, have a relative who's an inmate in a NY State Prison, and the author's description of visiting an inmate is both insightful, and in accord with my own experiences.Prison life is a plodding, dehumanizing, living hell for both the inmates and the CO's who must deal with them. Visits from family, or from friends are often the only bright spots in an inmate's bleak and miserable existence. You would think such visits would be encouraged and facilitated for the humanity, compassion, and redemptive influence they can bring to the convict. Instead, the NY State Dept of Corrective Services has an institutional proclivity toward making family visits just another punitive aspect of life in prison, except that it now extends beyond the convict to include his loved ones as well.The story is told in an omniscient 3rd person voice. I was expecting the story line would switch back and forth between Tommy (the convict), and Patty (his wife), but no: it sticks with Patty's experiences over the long prison term. A lot of the really bad stuff happening to Tommy behind bars is hinted at, but never actually described, because his character in the story wants to spare his wife the sordid details.In the end, I have great admiration for the Patty character. She does stick by her convicted felon husband, and thereby forfeits what could well have been a much happier life. Several times, Tommy offers her the chance to get out of it, but Patty chooses to endure. In another reality of the prison experience, most people put into that situation would justifiably bail out.Patty truly deserves to be called \\"The Good Wife\\"."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"After readingA Prayer for the DyingandThe Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedyby Stewart O'Nan and enjoying both, I figured I would give O'Nan another shot by reading \\"The Good Life.\\"\\"The Good Life\\" is set in the small New York Southern Tier village of Owego - it is a region O'Nan knows well and his depiction of the character and environs of Owego is spot on.Patty, O'Nan's heroine is at home pregnant when she receives a call late a night from her husband Tommy who has been arrested for Burglary, Arson and Murder. What follows is a story of Patty's perseverance.O'Nan spends a great deal of time on Tommy's trial and appeal. In it, O'Nan magically captures the plight of the family of the accused - on the outside of the criminal justice system looking in. Patty is slow to see that Tommy has been a thief for some time. Patty also struggles with the concept of guilt and innocence. She is focused on Tommy being \\"innocent\\" when the verdict delivered by a jury is simply \\"guilty or not guilty.\\" Many a criminal have been acquitted who are guilty as sin (see, e.g.If I Did It: Confessions of the Killerand it is equally true than innocent men have been convicted of a crime they did not commit. (seeActual Innocence: When Justice Goes Wrong and How to Make it Rightby Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld).As a testament to the amount of research O'Nan puts into his work, O'Nan painstakingly renders the New York criminal justice system in great detail. While most authors would be content to make up details, O'Nan is precise and accurate in the path of a criminal case in New York - even to the most minute detail that the Appellate Division, Third Department issues its decisions on Thursdays.Ultimately, O'Nan's Patty is the Good Wife - holding together her family despite the absence of her husband Tommy. Though she struggles, she also endures and manages to raise her son Casey to be a good man.If you like the fictional story of a woman holding a family together and being a good wife, then you would really like the true story written by Rich BlakeThe Day Donny Herbert Woke Up: A True Storyof Linda Herbert a mother of 4, whose husband Donny, a Buffalo firefighter was trapped under a collapsed roof in a burning house in 1995 and deprived of oxygen for six minutes. Donny suffered severe anoxic brain injury and lapsed into a long, largely unresponsive, nonspeaking state."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"I typically shy away from writing recommendations, always afraid someone might disagree. But, this is an amazing book that I couldn't put down and will not forget. Stewart O'Nan's The Good Wife is a surreal story that will leave you thinking and feeling. At the heart of this novel there is the question of loyalty and I suppose, unconditional love. Patty is an incredibly real character and the plot unfolds slowly, but the story is so gripping you cannot stop reading. I found myself desperate to get back to this book, reading on subways, in cabs, and now I can't stop recommending it. Stewart O'Nan is a talented writer and I'd love to thank him for this original, unforgettable story. I hate to write too much about plot here, but this is a book that can't be missed!"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Stewart O'nan writes this novel as only a top craftsman could. No tricks, no weak irony, no overblown sentiment, and no thin passages. As a story, a woman waiting for her convict husband, it bruises and massages the heart. As a book, as a novel, it is damn near perfect. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves good writing, no matter their favorite genre."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"How Mother preached \\"Its the people you have as friends that influence your life\\" She was right. It just takes one mistake sometimes for your life to change dramatically. He has written a book that can make many of us raised in a city look back and believe that it could have been any of us. Would we have had a wife that would wait? Would we have a Wife that would care? Would we have been able to care?. Although it is fiction I'm sure it's based on fact.I can only imagine what this fiction life is for many that have made that one life deciding mistake. This is a novel you wouldn't want to miss reading."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"I admire this book because I admire Stewart O'Nan. It's gutsy to write a book spanning twenty years in which \\"nothing happens\\". But ordinary life happens and everyone's life contains drama and poignancy. This O'Nan shows with such aplomb. Condensing years into narrative paragraphs is a feat only capable by a master writer like O'Nan. However, the big void in Patty's life becomes a big void in the reader's experience with very little to keep up the interest. It's hard to hold a book this like together. O'Nan manages to do it, but just barely. I didn't expect or need \\"twists\\" or cliffhangers or any of the kiddy-stuff some readers demand of their books-as-entertainment. However, the cardinal rule is: keep it compelling. I'm not sure he suceeded with me. I found myself skimming in places, and that's the death knell for fiction. The years cycle by, one into the next, as they do, and O'Nan depicts it well, it's real, but that does not make it complelling fiction. And, there's one major flaw with this book that O'Nan, I think, avoids dealing with because he didn't want to make the book sentimental: we never understand why Patty stays with Tommy through all of this. Twenty years. A lifetime, wasted. For what? He was not innocent. He was not a great man wronged. He wasn't a good husband--not that we ever see. So, why? With no answer to that question, to simply chalk it up to blind devotion, makes this character, as likable as she is (she's like a female Manny from Lobster), so weak and the reasoning so pointless as to make her ordeal, and thus the book, ultimately unworthy of the lauding O'Nan's other books deserve. Don't start with this one. O'Nan's great--one of our greatest. This book...while there's so much I like and admire about it, just isn't great."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"What if you woke one morning to a phone call from your husband telling you he was in jail? What if the charge was murder? Would you stand by him even after he were convicted?These are the questions Patty as the \\"good wife\\"Her husband Tommy is convicted of a crime and sent to prison for a LONG time. In the beginning Patty's belief in her husband's innocence seems painfully naive. Patty's mother thinks she should just give up and divorce him, much less continue to appeal his conviction.Patty is determined to raise their son Casey in such a way that he does not reject his father. She struggles with herself, her own feelings of being robbed of a \\"normal\\" married life through no fault of her own. She struggles financially - working class women are all too familiar with the kinds of jobs that Patty has to take to pay basic living expenses. She succeeds in maintaining a relationship with Tommy, despite the many obstacles put in her way by the criminal justice system.Prison life is a plodding, dehumanizing, living hell for the inmates. Visits from family, or from friends are often the only bright spots in an inmate's bleak and miserable existence.At times I would have loved to grab Patty and shake some sense into her. But then she proves me wrong in my opinions. You have to really respect and admire this girl with her choices of total loyalty and dedication to her husband behind bars.I didn't agree with the ending and I think I would have finished it differently.

I will recommend this novel to everyone I know. -- Monica Wood"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"O'Nan surely has a talent for making time fly. There are a few very important messages in his book. Don't drink. One small mistake can effect the lives of many in a big way.Patty is most definitely a hero.

The characters aged but did not grow. There was no reflection on the crime committed, or Tommy's motives, or the good wife's ignorance, and no discussion of how the son was affected by his father's imprisonment. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"One of life's big questions is should you be good for yourself or for someone else. How do you behave when no one is looking? Patty had so many options in this book. She could have become righteously indignant with her ner'do well husband when he got carted off to prison for murdering an elderly blind woman. She could have divorced him; leaving him to rot within the penal system. She did not - not because he didn't deserve it but because she didn't deserve it. The 28 year prison term was levied upon Patty as well as on Thomas and she endured. Patty played the hand she was dealt. Maybe life is easier if you do - instead of always looking for the greener pasture over the horizon only to find the same old thing. This novel proves that life is what you make it - you are the master of your own destiny. Oh, yes, Patty is more than a good wife, she is a good person.....bg"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"This novel, written by a male author, offers the reader a rare opportunity to step inside the tragic (yet ultimately triumphant) life of a devoted young wife and mother whose husband is imprisoned for several crimes he has committed. Stewart O'Nan is an excellent novelist and is amazing as the voice of \\"Patty\\" who is the main character of the \\"The Good Wife\\". \\"Day after day and year after year Patty has to deal with life on the outside\\" while her husband, Tommy is living his life on the inside of prison walls. Stewart O'Nan includes so many details /clues about thepassage of time that is so central to this novel. O'Nan also quotes the band Fleetwood Mac on two pages that demarcate divisions in this wonderful novel, taking the reader back to the 1970's with the nostalgia for the music, T.V. shows, cars, of that time period. An excellent read and I wouldn't be surprised if this novel was being adapted for a screenplay for a major motion picture...it would certainly boost flagging sales at the movies theaters."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"One might be forgiven for thinking Stewart O'Nan is some long-past author based on The Good Wife. After all, there are no post-post-modern pyrotechnics of style or voice, no multiple narrators, no funny typography, no pop culture reference, no winking ironic nods to irony. All he does is create compellingly human situations and people them with vividly realized characters, presenting the whole in sharp, crystalline prose that carries you along smoothly and seamlessly with characters you care about.In this case, O'Nan gives us Patty Dickerson, eight months pregnant and about to awakened by the phone call that will chart the next thirty years of her life-her husband Tommy calling from jail to tell her he and a friend have been arrested in the death of an elderly woman they were attempting to rob. We then follow Patty through the many day-to-day and year-to-year details as she copes with the trial, the appeals process, the imprisonment, the attempts at probation. All the while trying to raise her son and ward off the acidic effects of poverty as evident through the typically sharp details offered by O'Nan, the homemade Christmas ornaments, the self-doubt over the selling price of a used car, the constant move from one low-paying job to another.Along the way she takes what help she can. Some of it expected--she moves in for a while with the other \\"bad\\" sister, she takes a job on Tommy's old truck thanks to his buddy Russ, she finds some small commiseration with other prisoner wives. She also finds it in unexpected places, mostly from her mother whom we're set up early on to believe will simply pull an \\"I warned you\\" and let Patty fall.Patty's battles--with the court system, with her family, with Tommy, her growing son, with poverty, with minimum wage jobs, with self-doubt and feelings of faithlessness, with the passage of time and the dullness of geography are conveyed in single-voiced present tense in sequential order. And some will probably find this dull--too plain or too plainly presented. But it's the completeness of the picture, the fullness of the character, the vivid detail of the mundane that drags us into what becomes a profoundly if quietly moving story of much sorrow and some little triumph.If there is a single flaw in the book, it's the somewhat abstract presence of Patty's son Casey, who admittedly is seemingly meant to be somewhat sidelined based on his personality and character (and perhaps as well as a tangible reminder of the long-range impact of a single moment's stupidity and cruelty). Outside of that minor point, however, there's simply nothing to complain of here. It's a strong work by one of our best modern writers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Stewart O'Nan is one of America's best writers, and it's amazing that he hasn't found a bigger following. Snow Angels, The Speed Queen, The Night Country... His books are always incredibly well written, amazingly powerful and gripping.Now, after publishing The Night Country (his best book to date), he's back with The Good Wife, a soft, touching drama about the things a woman sacrifices for love. When Patty's husband is arrested for murder, arson and unlawful entry, she can't believe that the man she loves could ever be guilty of the crimes he's accused of committing. But after an unfair trial, he's sent to prison for life. And Patty, pregnant and broke, is left alone to deal with her life.Within the next three hundred pages, O'Nan moves through 30 years of pain and shame, as Patty tries to remain faithful and good to her husband, all the while caring for their quiet, sad son, Casey. Indeed, Patty is a good wife. Although temptation is always around the corner, the love she feels for Tommy and for their son is greater than anything else she might feel inside.It isn't easy being left alone to deal with their growing son and the world around them. But somehow, she manages. She goes from job to job, never able to find something she can call her own. Even her son is like a stranger to her. She doesn't understand him, she doesn't understand life. By the time Tommy is released from prison, they have grown old and their son is an adult. But the pain and the hardship remains. What you think will be a happy ending for this family is only a new beginning.It's amazing to see that O'Nan is able to move so seamlessly through nearly thirty years of a woman's life. His writing is poetic and powerful. Every word is important, every paragraph necessary to understand the characters and plot. This is a novel that is all about characters.But in the end, this one is not nearly as amazing as some of O'Nan's previous efforts. In the end, this isn't a story that will stay with you for a long time.I could easily see this novel becoming a serial television show. Every week, we'd see what Patty has to live through. We'd see her grow old as the world around her is never truly ready to accept her. The Good Wife is a nice story, don't get me wrong, just not a very important one."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"There were parts of this book that I liked, but overall, I thought it was slow going.

When he is released, they find their way through the maize of getting to know one another and finding the intimacy they had so long ago.A fairy tale? Who knows. It was a very wonderful story though!"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"This haunting novel describes in spare prose the long span of time that passes between the commission of a crime by Patty's husband, Tommy, and his release from prison many years later. Throughout it, Patty is the \\"good wife\\" indeed, nearly unwavering in her support for Tommy in the face of truly difficult circumstances. The graceful writing and moral dilemmas in this novel will stay with you long after finishing it.O'Nan provides a totally convincing portrayal of a segment of society--the spouses, usually wives, of convicts--that goes almost completely ignored and neglected. This book is searing reminder that crimes harm not only the victims of the crime, who naturally deserve the bulk of our sympathy, but also the criminal's loved ones. Tommy's apparent lack of recognition of, and remorse for, the harm he has done to his wife and the child he was not around to raise is one of the most disturbing aspects of the novel. Patty WAS a good wife, and she deserved more gratitude from Tommy than she received.What makes this novel deserving of 5 stars is not merely its story but the writing itself. In beautiful, spare prose O'Nan writes simply of the day to day complications of trying to get by as a single mother whose only hope for the future is at the far end of a 25-year sentence. Parts of Patty's life are described in detail, but in other parts of the book, entire years go by summarized in a phrase or a sentence. The tragedy of Patty's life is that entire years COULD be summarized in a sentence, and through his prose O'Nan communicates vividly the bleakness of a life placed far too long on hold.Should Patty have stuck by Tommy? That's a hard question. You have to admire her perseverance and willingness to stand by her marriage vows and her love her for husband, although the subplot involving her attraction for another man suggests that, once again, Patty let her life be determined by the actions (or inactions) of others. Given slightly different chance encounters, her story very easily could have ended differently. In a way, I see her story not being one of loyalty but rather passivity...to Tommy, to a penal system that transferred her husband to a facility a day's drive away, to a fate that treated her badly. Patty may have been a good wife, but in the final analysis, the only person that benefited was Tommy. And you finish the novel feeling utterly sad about all the wasted lives involved."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"And how much are you willing to pay?

Tommy is sentenced to prison, Patty has her baby and must find a way to survive not only financially but emotionally as well.Things are bleak - she cant hold a job, money is non existent and Tommy is moved from prison to prison, making visitation tough.I didn't feel that the novel was full of cliffhangers or suspense but I did want to continue reading till the end to see what would happen to Patty and Tommy. Would she stay or would she go? Would he ever get out of prison?

And then, the actual birth should be a celebration with the new parents buoyed by the good wishes of family and friends. None of this proved true for Patty Dickerson, although she deserved it for she was not only a good wife but a good woman. However, as we're often reminded, bad things do happen to good people.Stewart O'Nan has a gift for straight forward storytelling (The Night Country, Snow Angels). He doesn't need window dressing to create a novel that soon has the reader/listener totally involved with characters that remain with us long after the tale ends. \\"The Good Wife\\" is a prime example of the power of O'Nan's pen.Patty is awakened in the dark of night with a phone call from her husband, Tommy. What he describes as some trouble is much more than that.- he's been involved in a series of robberies and now he has been arrested for murder. What follows is the suspense of a trial and then his incarceration.There are, of course, visits to jail, but Patty is basically left to her own resources to earn a living and raise their son, Casey. This is not a happy story, simply an authentic one extremely well told.Voice performer Laural Merlington does full justice to Patty who is both protagonist and narrator. At times stricken, at other times brave, always enduring, Merlington carries listeners through over a quarter of a century in Patty's life.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"I probably shouldn't be writing this review. Since I finished this book a few days ago, I've recommended it to a few people, and when I told them what it was about, the response was the same: \\"it sounds awful--why would I read it?\\"So, in the interest of encouraging others to read the book, I will try to refrain from description (the formal and informal reviews on this site will give you the gist of the story anyway) and try to explain why this book had such an impact on me, and why (after I stayed up late to finish it) my sleep was wracked with cold sweat nightmares.All the really horrible events in the story occur offstage (the murder that precipitates the rest of the story, Tommy's various beatings) and the emotions that accompany them are painted in such subdued colors that we almost ache for the characters: Patty driving through the dreary countryside on her regular prison visits, Tommy returning to his cell, the interminable waits for news that's sometimes bad (denial of appeals) and sometimes a cause for celebration (family prison visits).Although Patty decries her son's lack of affect, she somehow does not seem to realize that she herself evinces little emotion. We, the readers, must feel it for her. She goes through the motions of life without asking many questions, feeling much grief, wishing her lot were better, or getting depressed. The inability of her husband and son to establish a close relationship seems to make her unhappy, but she is similarly unable to make any deep connection with anyone. She's there for Tommy because it's who she is. She accepts her life in a way that most of us refuse to accept the limitations of our lives. Even though I didn't like her very much (I did like mom and Tommy) I didn't want her to just sit back and take it.This is a story that throws its punches in negative space. Instead of turning the material into an overblown farce--the route most writers would take-- O'Nan does the opposite, working his magic in negative space. It's what he doesn't dare to discuss that gives this book its power.One of the final lines of the book encapsulates the creepy calm that permeates the whole: after Tommy is finally home following 28 years of imprisonment, Patty \\"dares to believe the long pause that's kept them from their real life is finally behind them.\\" At least for me, it was definitely not the sort of pause that refreshes."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"One of the things I liked best about this book was O'Nan's \\"cut to the chase\\" approach to telling this story. He did not bog it down with a lot of unnecessary description. Instead he told you just enough to put you in the moment.I felt a connection to Patty. Her struggles were very real to me. I could sympathize with her situation. She even annoyed me at times as well. I found her love for Tommy and her loyalty to her relationship with him touching and admirable. She is determined to make it through this because she genuinely loves this man. I like the fact that Tommy's prison life was not a central part of the story. If it had been, it would have totally detracted from what is essentially Patty's story.O'Nan could have easily written this book another way (i.e. Patty meets and falls in love with another man, Casey becomes a troubled teen, etc.) I think a lot of lesser authors would have done just that. Thankfully, instead of going the \\"romance\\" route, he has written a wonderful story of love, determination and perseverance."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"The Good Wife is another bittersweet (accent on bitter) tale of the inherent desperation of most people. Patty Dickerson's husband gets sent up for about 28 years for inadvertantly killing an old woman during a break-in of her house and O'Nan, in the stark spare writing style that he has mastered , chronicles Patty's journey from young and hopeful to middle-aged and resigned to her life's fate. Similiar in tone to his other books (especially Snow Angel), this story could make Bozo The Clown reach for the Prozac. The sadness is all over every page. O'Nan's understanding of the human psyche and his eye for understated detail give his narrative a powerful sense of realism. He uses real locations and obviously becomes a student of his subject. In this case its the New York Justice and penal system that treats all those connected with the offender as unworthy of any mercy. This is a tough work of fiction and brings to mind Henry David Thoreau's quote that \\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation\\". This is a very worthwhile book to read for many reasons. Quality writing, increasing one's knowledge base, and a sense of fellowship with others who hurt. For while the particulars of the story may be fictional the author' aim is true when it comes to articulating the common human condition. Lock up the meds and put the trigger-locks on and then set aside some time for this touching piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Told in a matter-of-fact, unsentimental way, The Good Wife tells the story of one family and 25 years of their lives as they work through the New York state penal system.Tommy Dickerson does something stupid. He follows his friend Gary's lead and ends up involved in a murder for which he (and not Gary) pays the price--25 years in prison. At the time of his arrest, his wife Patty is pregnant. This is her story.We see through her eyes the frustration of the poor as they try to work the system. Everything is against them, including, it seems, the public defenders. Then as the wife of a prisoner we see Patty at the mercy of the system again--as items are confiscated and her husband transferred from prison to prison (moving farther and farther away--to Dannemora and farther northwest, to eventually Bare Hill in Malone) as she is left to make due as a single mother.Though they do not thrive, their marriage survives and their son makes it through college and ends up with a great job. It's at the end when Tommy is released and they are together again as a family (like they never were before) that we realize that all of these years have been not just a sentence for Tommy, but for all the rest of them as well.Yes, Tommy was guilty of a crime. Even if the didn't commit the actual murder, he was there and could have stopped it. But the key to this story is not his guilt or innocence, rather it is about what happens to the family, the extended family, the friends of those imprisoned. What is the world like through their eyes. And you walk away from the book asking yourself, what would I do if my loved one was in jail? Would I be able to persevere as Patty does? Would I be such a good wife?It's a fascinating, quick read and if you have not read O'Nan before, you should know that he is great. He has a no nonsense approach to telling a story that is utterly engaging and in this book, he has succeeded in doing just that."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Others have already described the plot and characters. I'll just mention my reactions: at first I wondered why I was even bothering with this book...I guess it hooked me initially with a young husband being involved in a murder and being sent off to prison. As I continued reading about the 28 or so yrs Patty and Tommy are separated by prison walls I found this story so poignant, so heartbreaking, so bare and real, that it all seemed believeable to me. I could feel the dreary cold of upstate NY and the depressing lives of those there. It's made me think deeply about prisons and who occupies them. Depressing? Yes. And yet. There was some glimmer of hope just always around the corner, just out of reach. There was something about Tommy, so sweet, naive, innocent (and I'm not referring to his part in the crime) that just made my heart ache. Patty was a hero in my book. She endured. I loved this book and I think it WILL stay with me for a long while."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"The Good Wife is a simple book that tells a simple story about one family's struggle to survive in the face of daunting adversity. O'Nan does not embellish this story in any way, instead, chooses to relate the day-to-day struggle of a wife who spends most of her adult life waiting for the day her husband will once again be free.What impressed me the most about this book was the way that the author captured the mundanity of life in small-town American. As the locale for this book, he chose the Southern Tier of New York, with the bulk of the story taking place in Owego. He paints a picture of this rather dull, unexciting community that allows the reader to feel what it is like to live there.Patty, the \\"good wife,\\" travels around the state, visiting her husband when she can. O'Nan describes the drive to Auburn and Clinton, NY with such detail, that the reader can \\"see\\" the summer camps and abandoned trailers. As a resident of upstate New York, I have traveled to many of these areas, and as I read the book, was right there in the scene with Patty. I have also visited Auburn Correctional as part of an outreach program, and was impressed by his vivid depiction of not only the prison itself, but the essence of the community.O'Nan also offers a spot-on indictment of the New York State penal system. Prisoners are moved around and their families play a constant guessing game as to where they will go next, and how their lives will once again be upended. In one prison, there are overnight visits, in another there are none. Patty and her husband Tommy learn how to make do with the hand that they have been dealt, and emerge from it all intact.I appreciate O'Nan's simplicity of style and ability to bring these characters to life. All in all, it was a nourishing read, and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"What if you woke one morning to a phone call from your spouse telling you he or she was in jail?

The strength in this novel lies in the superb characterization because as the reader asks what kind of person could live his life this way, O'Nan answers it with credibility. It may not be a road you or I would take, but as we grow to understand Patty Dickerson, the reader can at least appreciate her choices come from her background and her self-imposed limitations.I highly recommend this novel. O'Nan has done it again."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Patty and Tommy are expecting their first child when Tommy is arrested for robbery and murder in the second degree. The Good Wife was not what I expected it be. In my opinion, it's not a page turner; yet, I was compelled to finish it, to find out what happens to Patty. This is the first novel I've read by Stewart O'Nan and his writing is pleasant. His introspective is accurate. The Good Wife provides more insight into how families are treated within the penal system than courtroom drama, but mostly it's a story about Patty, Tommy, their son and how they cope with life while Tommy is in jail."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"This book was so disappointing. It has an intriguing premise but the lack of tension and plot twist left me cold. The characters and story became so predictable and the ending is sappy sweet, it was very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"It started out good and the excerpt on the front cover was certainly catchy which made me pick it up in the first place. But after Tommy's imprisonment the story slowed down so much it came almost to a screeching halt. I could not identify with Patty or the rest of her family at all. I am a military spouse who has had to live through year-long deployments twice getting ready to face another one but Patty and I still never clicked. Sorry, but I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"The \\"Good\\" wife is anything but good. She is manipulative and cold, Actually she is a a high class prostitute. She has prostituted herself for what she feels is due her. Her older lover, who is in a position to \\"take care\\" of her, is also flawed psychologically. He is capable of acts of demonic meanness, so in actuality, they deserve each other. How they resove their problems, and bring their relationship to fruition is the true horror of this book. What good can come of it?! You decide!"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"The idea of this book was better than its reality. I really enjoyed the author's writing style, so for that alone it gets two stars. However, the lead character, Tommy, is so patently unlikeable and uninteresting, it's hard to fathom his wife waiting idly by for 25 years for him to get out of prison. She is blindly devoted, never really asking the questions most people would, especially about the night in question (and Tommy's history of repetitive burglary). The ending is unrealistic and sugary sweet, so that doesn't really fit after a fairly realistic, depressing rendition of Patty's day to day existence. Overall, I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Dull with a capital D! The plot was almost as thin as the character development (or lack thereof)"},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"I ran across a copy of \\"Speed Queen\\" in my local library and that was it; I was hooked on Stewart O'Nan. As I've said before, I only write reviews if I feel very passionate one way or the other about a book or an author. I LOVE this author. It's just like reading about someone you know or even about yourself. Sometimes the books can seem a little slow, like his latest one, \\"Emily Alone\\", but I don't care, I still can't put them down. I'm on a mission to read all of them and I hope he's on a mission to write more and more and even more."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"After reading Last Night at The Lobster I ordered up all of Stewart O'Nan's books from Amazon. I made my way thru them all in 2 days - and The Good Wife is myfavorite of his books - Thanks, Stewart, for enhancing my home library."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"Patty, who is pregnant with her first child, is woken up one night by a phone call: her husband Tommy is in jail for murder. The story continues as Tommy fights the charges against him. Typical for O'Nan, the story unwinds carefully and patiently, focusing on the small details of Patty's experience throughout the ordeal. O'Nan clearly did his research. The best part of this book is the tender and hyper-realistic depiction of Patty and Tommy's relationship over many years. On the downside, the plot bogs down at times and can seem monotonous. This may be intentional by O'Nan, but the reading experience suffers as a result. The Good Wife is not O'Nan's best but a worthwhile read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"I really like the work of Stewart O'Nan. I think this is a very good book: This is what it would be like if your husband committed a crime, was sent to jail, and you stood by him for his term (25 years). It give a realistic view of what it must be like for family members to deal with incarcerated relatives. What I find interesting is that I don't know if Tommy was the murderer. I also find it compelling that she stood by him for all the years he was in jail. She worked and held the family together (with her mother playing a big role). I think he took the fall for his so-called buddy, Gary. But I think the story is what could happen. The coldness of the criminal justice system is portrayed so well. I think this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"this book is very sad. it tells the tale of one woman's courage to live and stay strong in the worst of situations. Stewart's narration is convincing and realistic. He really gets the reader inside of Patty's head as she endures years and years of hardship, while clinging on to the only thing worth clinging onto: love. YOu will find yourself both crying and smiling and unable to put it down. It is depressing, but highlighted with Patty's small victories such as successfully raising her son and moving herself up in the working world. Patty has it tough and her determination should attract even the most obscure of readers. It is a tale of love lost and it will break your heart over and over again."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"It's interesting to be a \\"latecomer\\" to reviewing a book. It's easy to wonder what people were expecting. The life of someone whose spouse is serving a life sentence is unlikely to be a cliffhanger. O'Nan propels Patty's story largely through the details of daily life. It's full of knowing kernels of difficult jobs, the closed gossipy environment of a small town, and the limited opportunities for a high school graduate. O'Nan cpatures telling pieces of daily life, how summer nights evolve from fireflies at dusk to mosquitos that signal time to return indoors. Patty is tempted to have an affair, or at least see if one is possible. She puzzles her way through raising a son who keeps his distance, and she co-exists with a mother who is none too happy with her choices. Tommy, the husband, is at best a patsy in the crime that leads to imprisonment. That's the best Patty can think and we get the impression she tries not to think too much about it.We don't really get much of a picture of Tommy's time behind bars. He is suddenly transferred from one facility to another with little explanation, but otherwise serves \\"good\\" time. We also don't really get to know the son. The story is in the omniscient third person but really tries to capture Patty's experience, surviving one day after the next. Still, we get to know more about her sisters than we do ther husband and son and we don't really know that much about her mother. The story is well paced, but gets a little bogged down during the trial. There is little evidence to argue and little basis for any melodramatic tv courtroom moments. Otherwise, the spare prose is all we need to move along. O'Nan has chosen a rather unusual basis for fiction and an even more unusual perspective for the story. Sometimes, O'Nan could have filled in more dots, but, in many ways, it's useful that he lets us fill in some of the gaps, as well."},{"Title":"The Good Wife","review":"In The Good Wife, O'Nan tackles an unusual and obscure topic with a fine sensitivity to the nuances of daily life and difficult choices. In upstate New York Patty Dickerson is pregnant with her first child, waiting for her husband to return home after a few celebratory drinks with his best friend, Gary, after a ball game. Patty is awakened before dawn to a ringing telephone, her husband's side of the bed empty. Answering, Patty learns that Gary and her husband, Tommy, have been arrested, but she doesn't know the charges or what bail to expect. Patty calls a lawyer, only to learn that they likely cannot afford his services. Later, at the courthouse, Patty learns that her husband is accused of manslaughter for the accidental death of an old woman at the time of a robbery, one of many committed by the two men. Na?ve and without resources, Patty is confronted with bureaucratic court obstacles and a lack of money that will plague Tommy's defense and their ability to navigate the legal and penal system.Tommy receives a sentence of twenty-eight years, husband and wife leaving the courtroom stunned, Tommy to a jail cell, Patty to a changed life. Thus begins Patty's journey through the following years of Tommy's incarceration, now one of the relatives of those who live behind bars, as imprisoned in many ways as those who have been convicted of crimes. Unwilling to give up on her love of her husband or her dreams of family, Patty takes on her immediate future, clinging to the necessity of making a living and raising their son, Casey, her connection to Tommy maintained through weekend visits and letters, all of them restricted by an unbelievable amount of red tape. Year after year, Patty remains loyal, refusing to abandon hope in the face of the years ahead without her husband. Casey grows up in the shadow of Tommy's incarceration, learning to keep secrets from the children at school.In the very simplicity of the prose and the numbing boredom of Patty's days, O'Nan illustrates the toll taken on family members who struggle to keep their relationships intact, the natural apathy of institutionalization and the hopelessness that dogs every day, month and year of the sentence. Patty's youth passes in limbo, waiting for the next visit, worrying about her son's adjustment in a foreign environment that sets them apart from everyone they know. Tommy does the time, but it is Patty who holds the family together, with her refusal to relinquish the bright promise of her youth and her love for Tommy. This behind-the-scenes view of prison life as lived by spouses reveals is unexplored territory, a family trapped by one man's crime against society, a good wife refusing to relinquish her family to its fate.

Holding things together until he returns.This could be seen as a weakness, for both the protaganist of the novel and to the reader of the novel.The reader gets no insight into how any of the other characters thinks or feels except through whatever the \\"Good Wife\\" herself gleans or discovers.It's an interesting read that will allow the reader to think and imagine.But the inherent weakness of focusing only on her limited viewpoint renders this novel an interesting writing exercise that will ultimately give no satisfaction to the reader."},{"Title":"Folk medicine;: A Vermont doctor's guide to good health","review":"I used Dr. Jarvis honey &amp; vinegar for arthritis in l974.

I took out every book in the county library determined to find a cure. After researching through many, many books I came across this little gem. I will tell you that I immediately started my mother on apple cider vinegar, honey, and water. When we returned for her first revisit to her rhumetologist there was no swelling, or outward appearances of her ever having had arthritis. He had us go to the lab for bloodwork, and called us within a couple of days. So back we went, only for him to tell us that there were no longer any indications of the arthritis, and had he not examined her himself initially he would swear that we got the wrong lab work. My Mom passed away in 2009 and never had another day of arthritic pain. Not only that, but her severe struggles with phlegm disappeared also. These are a few of the things I learned from this book.

St. Laurent attempts to help readers understand the variations and complexities involved in deciding what kind of licensing model to apply to software being developed and how to understand the complexities and requirements of open source and free software licensing that someone may want to use and incorporate in software packages being developed for internal use and/or external distribution. If you are willing to slog through this short book (I say slog because it is full of legal terminology) to filter out his explanations, you may find this book useful. If you are not, you may find yourself frustrated.As a lawyer, Mr. St. Laurent does a very capable job in explaining the history of copyright law and then picking apart what the individual sections of licences actually mean. But he lost me early on by the very way he organizes and characterizes certain fundamental concepts, and this presentation is carried through out the book. At the outset, he talks about the fact that licenses are in fact contracts, but does not get into detailed discussions of how contracts are formed and the issues of contracts until Chapter 6. In this chapter he talks about assumptions about contracts and meanders his ways around to discussions of the required elements to have a contract, but never addresses them as such. Instead, he treats them as \\"concepts\\" as opposed to requirements. This discussion, which should have been covered in Chapter 1 as a succinct discussion of the required elements of a valid contract, easily gets lost as the readers may have struggled through all of the legal jargon and analysis that proceeded it. If he had done so, the discussion around each of the licenses could have been presented and understood in a more straightforward manner.That leads to my second criticism of the book. He treats each type of license (GPL, MIT, BSD, GNU General Public License, etc) individually, which made it more difficult to cross reference. As a reader interested in the best type of license to work with or how to understand a license presented, I would preferred to have each element of s standard license discussed, followed up by a comparison of how each license type addresses this issue. At the end (or even as an addendum), a chart showing the relationships, restrictions, permissions, etc of all the licenses would have been very useful.This is not to say that the book is without merit. He does make it easy to see how people and companies/corporations can easily slip up in how they approach open source/free software. He also talks about how these different types of licensing models have evolved over time. And without saying it, he started my mind thinking about the concept of \\"legal capacity\\" and contracts. In most of the United States, a widely held legal concept is that an unemancipated minor (i.e. someone under the age of 18) does have the legal capacity to enter into a contract and these contracts cannot be legally enforced. If this continues to be held as a legal principal, how can any software license be enforced against young people who buy, sell, trade, \\"liberate\\" ( a nicer word for stealing copies), or do other things with software they have purchased? This might make for an interesting discussion down the road.So who should read this book? This book should be retained by business control, purchasing/acquisition and information system audit professionals as a guide when reviewing licensing issues related to internal controls and IS governance. These professionals should read and digest the material, with the help of legal counsel, and educate developers, administrators, and line of business project sponsors as to what it means and how it applies. It is not a book for developers and administrators should have themselves unless they really want to get into legal nitty gritty.The Business Controls Caddy Rating: Bogey on Short Par 4.Christopher Byrne, IBM CAAD/CASAThe Cayuga Group, LLC\\"The Business Controls Caddy\\"http://www.thecayugagroup.com/"},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"Understanding Open Source & Free Software LicensingAndrew M. St. Laurenthttp://www.oreilly.com/catalog/osfreesoft/When sharing with others that I was reviewing an O'Reilly book through their User Group & Professional Association Program, the first question was always the same: \\"What book are you reviewing?\\" After saying the title was \\"Understanding Open Source & Free Software Licensing\\", responses ranged from \\"What's that?\\" to \\"Well, you won't have any trouble sleeping!\\" One might think that this list of people included relatives and coworkers who were not attuned to the open source community and its issues. On the contrary, the responses came from those within my circle of acquaintances that include software developers, system administrators, and even an intellectual property lawyer. Licensing is not exactly the sort of topic where people slide forward in their seats and ask to be told more. Such is the appeal of software licensing; however, the importance of understanding licensing, particularly within the context of open source development, cannot be overstated.Those familiar with the O'Reilly product offerings have no doubt seen or purchased one or more their Pocket Reference series (http://pocketrefs.oreilly.com/). They are not comprehensive references, but rather convenient guides for a specific topic to provide the sort of information one is not likely to have committed to memory, particularly as the trend of having cross-disciplined technologists continues. This book could be considered the analog of pocket guides for open source and free software licensing. Open source licenses and their legal interpretation are subject matter that easily warrant a \\"pocket reference\\" that is a full-sized book of nearly 200 pages.Frankly, reading through a software license and maintaining a reasonable level of comprehension is a rather tough job. The author manages to make the task far more bearable and fruitful at the same time; a difficult balance to strike. The pace of the annotation works well to break up the various licenses (twelve in total) into bite-sized chunks. Chapters 2 and 3, which address the BSD/MIT family of licenses and the GPL/LGPL/MPL family of licenses respectively, each end with a section titled \\"Application and Philosophy\\" that serves as a sort of reward for making it through the license and establishes a touchstone to summarize and provide meaningful context for what has been covered.The annotations of the different licenses are a great introduction, but the book should not be considered as a complete reference for open source licensing issues. The book seems to affirm this at points where the author indicates that particular topics fall outside the book's scope, even to the point of recommending experienced legal counsel for certain issues. It also has a wonderful collection of footnotes and reference to other resources to allow the reader to flesh out topics of interest beyond the focus of this work.One subtlety of the book that should not be missed is how the history of the open source movement is woven throughout the book to provide the context in which these licenses came into being and were modified to accommodate the vibrant, emerging world of open development models. The book's last two chapters bring that context to the foreground, fully developing the consequence of the licenses in daily development activity. It is far too easy to view these licenses and as mere legal documents that exist in and of themselves; the author reminds us that these licenses are the manifestations of a spirit of selfless contribution and work toward social good made possible by the considerable sacrifice of quite gifted individuals. For those passionate about the open source and free software movements, the section of chapter 7 titled \\"Models of Open Source and Free Software Development\\" is a poignant and stirring encapsulation of the first years of the GNU and Linux projects and the work that brought them into being. The clich&eacute; rings true; we do indeed \\"stand on the shoulders of giants.\\"The number of editorial errors involving misspelled and/or missing words seemed relatively high; this is a trend that seems to have developed in technical books in recent years, to a point that the technical community has come to accept it as some sort of side effect of the rapid pace with which books must be produced in order to keep pace with the rate of change. Given that this is an issue present in other works as well as this one, it should not particularly count as a mark against the work, but rather serve to underscore an issue publishers should consider improving.\\"Understanding Open Source & Free Software Licensing\\" is a book which strikes a balance between completeness of subject matter coverage and manageability of size. Given the amount of attention the average open source user or developer has given to licensing, reading this book would be a considerable improvement. This book is recommended for a couple of audiences. First, it serves as a great foundation for developers either active in or contemplating participation in open source development. Searching most any open source mailing list for the term \\"license\\" can usually turn up some of its hottest flame wars. If most developers had this introductory level of understanding about the main open source licenses, hundreds of message threads arguing about licensing could be avoided.A second audience for this book is the project manager and/or CTO in most corporate IT shops. Most corporate projects are making use of numerous open source libraries and frameworks. This is particularly true with J2EE, but also with .Net as a number of .Net counterparts to popular J2EE resources arise, e.g. NAnt, NUnit, etc. This book can dispel unnecessary apprehension regarding the use of these libraries that often arises from fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) propagated in much of the mainstream technology media. It can also equip managers to make informed decisions about team members' potential contributions to open source projects and the potential legal implications."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"I am an attorney who does open source software license work for a living. When this book came along, I picked it up, mostly because I was interested in seeing how O'Reilly does branching out well beyond its usual technical subjects. As you are probably aware, 2004 was the year of open source, according to some publications. Well, it was also the year of open source books. I have seen at least five that deal with the topic directly.Getting to the merits of St. Laurent's book, I struggled with whether to give it three or four stars. You see, even as a lawyer I found it lacking in clarity and flow. Overall, I am opposed to the route he took in excerpting almost every term of each license and then providing exposition of his own that was a lot of times hardly more helpful than the original license language. A better approach to explaining the licenses can be found in Larry Rosen's wonderful book \\"Open Source Licensing.\\" However, this downside becomes an upside when using the book as a reference, instead of an educational guide (justifying the fourth star). St. Laurent's approach here is useful for going into more depth on a particular license. Perhaps that was the goal all along.Another advantage this book has over Rosen's is its broader treatment of the growing array of licenses and license types. St. Laurent covers more licenses and for that I am thankful. In the end, I would recommend having a copy of both Rosen's and St. Laurent's book handy. And whatever you do, skip Rod Dixon's \\"Open Source Software Law.\\""},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"O'Reilly books are traditionally written for an experienced computing audience. For the most part, the publisher has eshewed going after a mass market. This book is a little different from the usual fare. It is certainly aimed at experienced IT personnel. But it is in a context where they are now laymen.The author gives a careful exposition of the many legal niceties surrounding open source licensing. He tries to convey nuances that are implied by the generous amounts of boilerplate quoted from common licensing schemes like GPL. Frankly, you may have to force yourself to concentrate and plow through the text. Unless your expertise is patent and copyright law, the book is not the easiest reading. No fault of the author. And the issues he discusses can certainly impact your company's code development.The book is probably most suitable for an IT manager."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"Software licensing can be one of the most confusing issues of software installation and development. Most people assume that there are few if any issues with Open Source and Free Software Licensing but that often is not the case. While it may be free to install you wade into murky waters when you change the code, make a new program that uses some of the coding of the open source program, make a derivative program, or a host of other situations. Part of the confusion is that all Open Source or Free Software licensing is not the same. For example there are the MIT, BSD, Apache, and Academic Free Licenses. Or what about the GNU license? Most people don't realize that there are two different versions of GNU licenses, the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)? Then there is the Mozilla Public License, Q Public License, Artistic License, and Creative Commons License.Author Andrew M. St. Laurent does an excellent job explaining all these various licenses, what you can do and can't do, the various benefits and shortcomings of the licenses and pitfalls to watch for. If you are doing development in this arena, have made an improvement to one of the programs, or have written a program for internal use that might have resell value you can't afford to not understand the nuances of the various licensing agreements.

However, the author has managed to make this both interesting and educational.It covers all the common open source licenses, explaining what each section means, and digging into problems that might come up for the licensor or licensee. Open Source isn't all that it covers: standard shrink-wrap licenses are examined, as is Sun's Community Source License and Microsoft's \\"Shared Source Initiative\\".Finally, the book itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs license. It is interesting that O'Reilly is willing to publish works like this, but I'm glad they are."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"I say in the subject that it brings 'more' life to a dry subject because I review Prentice-Halls \\"Open Source Licensing\\" a while back and found that it brought life to the subject of licensing, but this book is better.First off, it's not just annotated licenses. The first chapter and the last few chapters provide a perspective on licensing through the perspective of the open source software developer. That is invaluable. Without perspective the book is simply translations of legal mumbo jumbo. These perspective sections provide a mental framework for understanding the need for licensing and how it fits into the software development life-cycle.I highly recommend this book to those who are confused by the morass of open source licenses. It effectively clears away the fog and provides both perspective and translation on this difficult subject."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"I think the book accomplishes what it sets out to do quite well. Let's be clear, it's a book about licenses and legal issues. If you're not a lawyer, don't try to read this without your favorite caffeinated beverage within reach.If you are considering releasing software under a free or open source license, this book does a fine job at comparing and contrasting the different types of existing licenses. It gives you examples from existing software projects of what types of things may happen with your software based on which type of license you choose to distribute your code under.On the flipside, if you are considering using some of open source software in a commercial project, this will give you pointers as to what types of things you can and can't do with software licensed under the various free and open source licenses. The author's explanations are easy to understand.It also describes the Sun Community Source License, which explains what you can and can't do with the Java source code, for example, which I found interesting. The only thing I didn't find an explanation for was why every license needs to USE ALL CAPS SOMEWHERE in the text... =)The book does what it sets out to do; compare and contrast the various free and open source licenses."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"this book covers all of modern open source license which i wanted to know. also, it explain them very easy understanding way."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"I actually read this book about a year ago and forgot to do a review. It is helpful and explains what for me is a confusing topic in clear concise language. I find myself going back to it again and again. Particularly useful for those trying to figure out a way to make a business from open source software."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"I've had a good hour or so to sit and read through \\"Understanding Open Source & Free Software Licensing, by Andrew M. St. Laurent (Oreilly 2004 - ISBN: 0596005814) and thought I would share my opinion on it.Let me first begin by saying that the author did a great job of being concise. I'd had some free time today, and was at first hesitant to begin, as I thought it may be too dry for a saturday afternoon. St. Laurent did a great job of reeling me in though, with a quick, easy to understand example of basic copyright as it stands in the US, along with brief explanations on how closed-source and open-source licensing influences that copyright.The book then goes into different types of open source/free software licensing: GPL, LGPL, Apache, Qt, Creative Commons, BSD, etc - all of the usual suspects, and then some. Then, in chapter 5, the author talks about \\"Closed Source\\" licensing, for the reason being that \\"understanding proprietary licenses can also be important, as companies...(are) attempting to reap some of the benefits of a more open development model.\\"Chapters 6 and 7 get to the heart of the matter, discussing the legal aspects, derived works and forking of OS projects, choosing a license and even the \\"negative\\" aspects of OS licensing.I would say that the author deserves your hard-earned sheckles for this book. He does a good job of delivering a widely debated, legal topic to the folks who need to understand it the most, software developers and their IT collegues."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"Most of this book is just a copy of the commonly used licenses with paragraph-by-paragraph annotations. There is very little sense of the big picture here, and while the details are important, they're ultimately just confusing without some notion of where the different licenses are coming from and what they are meant to be about. The comments themselves are good, but that just isn't enough."},{"Title":"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing","review":"People don't realize how important licensing is with open source, but there is a lot.Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing is a very needed book and well written."},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"This is a very entertaining book but at the same time informative. The best part of course are the recipes. And the layout is wonderful. Good work and I can't wait to get Crazyplates!:-)"},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"What do you get when you cross animated cartoon-like pictures, low fat recipes, funny headlines and titles, jokes and funny stories? No it's not the entertainment section of your newspaper, but it is entertaining. Two Sister, Janet and Greta Podleski took all of those items and more to put together their fun cookbook, Looneyspoons published by Granet Publishing.The Podleski sisters compiled over 150 \\"outrageously delicious low-fat recipes\\" to create this book. Looneyspoons, also has a funny joke on almost every page. For example on the Another One Bites the Crust bread recipe page is a cartoon that says, Wife: \\"What wrong with this cake, Dear? It tastes kind of gritty.\\" Husband: \\"Nothing, sweetheart. The recipe called for three whole eggs and I guess I just didn't get the shells beaten up fine enough.\\" Some other recipe titles include: Don't Worry. Be Crabby; I Yam What I Yam; Beyond Be-Leaf Garden Salad; No Peeking! We're Dressing!; It's Only Brocc \`n Bowl (with the cartoon \\"I'll have the turtle soup and make it snappy!\\"); Chowdown Chickpea Chowda; Much Ado About Nothing (What did the leftovers say when they were put into the freezer? foiled again); Go Ahead, Bake My Bread; Sky High Vegetable Pie; Chili Chili Bang Bang; Lasagna with Mex Appeal (we all have a washboard stomach. It's just that some of us have a little extra laundry on top.); Luciano's Panzerotti; Eenie Meenie Fettuccine; Thai It! You'll Like It!; A Penne For Your Thoughts; Dillicious Lemon Chicken; Grocery Cart Chicken Chili (Did you hear about the boy who drank 8 Cokes? He burped 7-up.); Chicken Catcha Tory; I'm a Sole Man; Happily Marri-nated salmon Steaks; Mission Shrimpossible; Veal of Fortune; \\"Dressed to Grill\\" Pork Chops; Pork-u-Pine Kabobs; Glazed and Confused Carrots; All in the Yamily; Cookoo Over Couscous; Dream Team Cream Pie; Say \\"Cheesecake (Did you hear about Snow White's brother? His name is Egg White. Get the yolk?); Rude Barb's Strawbapple Crisp; Viceless Riceless Pudding (did you he! ar about the new restaurant on the moon? The food's great but it just doesn't have any atmosphere.); and Ross Perogies. Every recipe also contains a \\"what's in it for me?\\" section that outline the per serving nutritional information. These two beautiful women have made a really fun cookbook. It may be one of the only cookbooks on your shelf that will not only offer some good recipes, but it will also make you laugh time and time again."},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"Having worked with Greta in the past at a youth emplyment counselling centre, I was somewhat amiss about the change in her career.

I love it!"},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"I couldn't wait to get ahold of this book after so many rave reviews. I didn't find the recipes all that appetizing (their other book CRAZY PLATES was better in this regard), the recipe titles were confusing, and I found the comics mostly annoying."},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"There are some tasty recipes in this book, but the names of them are each trying so hard to be funny that you can't always tell what the recipe is for and there are no &quot;sub-titles&quot; to tell. Examples of recipes include: &quot;A Penne Yearned&quot;, &quot;A Curried Affair&quot;, &quot;All in the Yamily&quot;, &quot;La Rice-a Bon-eata&quot;, &quot;We're Talking Small Potatoes&quot;, and so forth. It's impossible to tell what the dish is, much less whether it's a main dish, side, or dessert. For that reason, I don't use the book very often and wish I had spent my money on something else."},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"Someone gave this book to me a gift and I have to say I thought it was too cutesy and childish for a &quot;serious&quot; cook like myself (although, I don't cook that much I thought that when I did get around to cooking I better be serious and go with Martha Stuart). In truth, Martha is probably why I hate cooking -- the recipes take hours, you can rarely find all of the ingredients and the dish never comes out looking just right! Looney Spoons has showed me how fun and easy cooking can be and I love to cook now. I can make great low-fat meals in no time; this is by far the best cookbook I've ever had. The authors are really funny and the recipes taste great. They do a lot with spices which is something I've never experimented too much with before... HIGH APPLAUDES TO THE AUTHORS FOR SUCH AN AMAZING COOKBOOK!"},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"This book, and its companion Crazy Plates, are fantastic. Partly with the help of these two books, I have been able to lose 73 pounds since last Christmas (OK, I had a lot to lose! :)) The recipes are more delicious than I thought possible - even preferable to &quot;regular&quot; recipies!My favorite from this book is the outstanding breakfast omelette recipe. It tastes great, and is extremely simple to make. I could not believe how much of this dish I could eat and still stay legal!A nice feature of the book is that every recipe has the fat and calorie information listed clearly at the bottom by portion. Take it from a big eater, the portions are generous. We have even lowered the fat and calorie content of several of the dishes in the book ourselves, substituting things like fat free chicken broth instead of standard chicken broth, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Free for butter, egg substitutes for eggs, and black tiger shrimp (less fat and calories) for regular pink shrimp.Even though I have lost 73 pounds, I have a good bit more to go, with maintenance after that. This book will have a welcome place in our kitchen for years to come!"},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"This cookbook is full of fabulous recipes that are made from easily obtainable ingredients.

The illustrations really set the humorous tone. It's actually fun to just get the book out to read it even when I don't feel like cooking. Once you make the recipes you won't believe they're low fat! An outstanding book. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"Not only is this the best low-fat cookbook I have (and I have lots), but it is the best cookbook, PERIOD. I have tried six recipes so far, and I love all of them. (Miss American Thigh MMMMMM, and Bananaberry Bombs!!!) They are also very easy, and don't contain the funky ingredients that ALL my other low-fat cookbooks have. If something is different, the authors tell you what it is, and where to find it. They have lots of interesting tidbits, too. It's one where you could actually go page to page and read (I read it on a plane trip). I would love to see the authors on their own cooking show, because I bet they're a riot! I have read many reviews at Amazon (and based purchasing decisions on them), but haven't been compelled to write one until now. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"I wrote a review of this great cookbook in April when I had lost 73 pounds, using this book among other things. I just wanted to update everyone that I am still with the diet, eating 2-3 of these recipes for dinner each week, and now have lost a total of 142 pounds. I still have a few more to go, so I'm sticking with it. This book will make maintenance much easier - it has lots of great tasting and easy to prepare ideas that we have used to create our own dishes as well."},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"...which has turned me off from cooking out of cookbooks, let alone lowfat recipe cookbooks! But, this book makes it hard to mess up at all! I highly recommend it! As a new mom, I'm still trying to lose my 'baby' weight. Choosing lowfat recipes for me and trying to satisfy my 6'2&quot;, 220 lb. husband's appetite can be quite a struggle! My own menu has begun to bore even me and I shudder to think of the fat content of my own best recipes. Last night I made &quot;Reggae Gumbo&quot; and my husband couldn't get enough of it! I was amazed how little the ingredients cost and how simple the recipe really was for such a flavourful concoction. My sister who cooks for her three children aged 3, 5 and 7 out of Looney Spoons regularly let me sample her favourite recipes out of the book...I was sold after one bite! She bought me the book for my birthday at my request! Last weekend, another sister of mine and I went shopping, she bought Looney Spoons and was thumbing through it, deciding on a recipe to try - she was stopped by a woman who noticed and the woman told her she had it too and how much she loved it...she went on to recommend her favourite recipes out of it. So my sister cooked recipes from Looney Spoons for the last three nights, remarking how easy and delicious every dish has been. So, I say to you from a 'the chef who can screw up any recipe' - give this book a try, you'll find yourself recommending it to your friends and family too!"},{"Title":"Looneyspoons: Low-Fat Food Made Fun!","review":"Thank heavens there is finally a tasty guide to low fat eating.

My kids loved the food too...and looking at the book always makes me smile.The thing that kept me from rating this book a 5 star is that it did not include pictures of the food. I like to look at the pictures of the food before I try an item...this often helps in the presentation, and to determine if my kids will try it.Definitely a cookbook to add to your collection.

I have entered my chili each of the three years we have had the contest but this year I won first prize (a certificate and a cap) for the chili I cooked from my Crazy Plates Cook Book. The chili got great reviews from judges and attendees. Chilis were judged for aroma, colour, texture, taste and after-taste.Actually I have used the same recipe each year only this year I remembered to put in all the ingredients as stated in the recipe.
