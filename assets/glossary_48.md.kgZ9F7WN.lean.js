If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is arguably the best novel about the struggles of the poor during this time. Focusing on the hardships of the Joad family and their friends, Steinbeck gives us, in microcosm, a look at the entire population of the dispossessed of the Great Depression. The constant hunger, searches for work, violence, betrayals and setbacks that the Joads endure would have produced a grim and depressing novel in a less skilled writer's hand, but Steinbeck does not allow his characters to give in. In spite of all the calamities, the Joads maintain dignity, courage, and hope. Fortunately, for America, the poor did maintain these virtues, otherwise it would have vanished or rebelled, throwing the nation into anarchy. THE GRAPES OF WRATH, however, shows our generation just how close we came.Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I'd highly recommend this book.

There are some good lessons learned in their story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was the one great novel Steinbeck was born to write. Of the authors 17 books I dear say this must be the best one. The novel won Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and it was \\"a cornerstone\\" of his 1962 Nobel Prize award.From the first page I fell in love with Steinbeck's way of writing, his humble and delicate language. Published in 1939, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the 250 000 American migrants who pulled up, and headed west on Route 66 - to California.Through the book we follow one of the families that headed west, The Joad family. We enter the story as Tom Joad, one of the children in the family, gets out of jail. He comes home, finding his family suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Tormented and forced to leave their land, the Joad's strap as many of their belongings as they can to their truck. With the truck piled high they hit the road for their journey to promise land - to California.The Joad's believe that leaving Oklahoma for California is the answer to all their troubles. California will be abundant with opportunities - work for everyone, plenty of food, oranges and peaches on every tree. Pa even has a leaflet saying they need thousands of men on the farms. Reality will soon catch up with them. The journey to California turns out to be everything but easy. They experience all sorts of hardship; loss of family members, trouble with the truck, harassment by the police and locals. When the Joad's finally make it to California, their troubles and suffering are rewarded not by work, plenty of food, and oranges on every tree, but with even more troubles. While moving around, following the different picking seasons chasing for work, the family is enduring such poor living conditions. They are living in squatter camps, government camps, and in the end shacks in labour camps.The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are all very well developed. They are so vivid and one cannot help but to care deeply for them all. Several of the characters have left a lasting impression; Tom Joad, Grandpa, the courageous ex-preacher, and above all Ma Joad. She is a loveable, courageous, strong woman and I admire her spirit, dignity and her determination as she struggles to keep her family together. Even facing so much testing and hardship, she still keeps perspective and hope.An experiment that works well in this novel is the \\"in-between\\" chapters. Short stories with reflections and background about the Great Depression; how a used-car dealer take advantage of his desperate customers or how farmers sprayed oranges with kerosene and threw potatoes in the river to keep market prices up while hundreds of thousands of people was starving, as well as other small stories, true literary treasures such as the first \\"in-between\\" chapter about the turtle.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is written in a most memorable way. The book is no less than a landmark in American history and it is one of the absolute greatest and most significant novels of the last century. This book deserves every bit of praise and reward that it has received. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Well, I hate to disappoint anybody, but I was forced to read this book over the summer for my LA class.

A great book"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is truly a masterpiece of American fiction. Steinbeck is a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display as he chronicles the upheaval and trials of the Joad family, a band of 'Okies' who leave Oklahoma in hopes of a better life in California. Their story isn't specific to the Joads alone; it is the story of the dispossessed whose dreams continued to float away from them despite their best efforts to achieve them.The Joad family is forced to leave their home and believe a better life awaits them in California. Steinbeck chronicles in unflinching and bitter reality the travails of life on the road. He poignantly describes the hatred and greed of the rich against the poor, and the effect that mass-farming will have on the land. He captures the migrant life with vivid detail and touching observations.Steinbeck alternates between the Joad family's quest and the quest of all the dispossessed - the alternating chapters filled with descriptions of life during 1930s America, the depression and greed that collided when the have nots met those who had. The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" continuously search for a better life, a life that is just as continuously denied them, as their family and their willpower breaks down. Steinbeck leaves the reader wondering what will become of the Joad family, and the others like them. And although we can guess what their plight will continue to be, the astute author leaves the reader with an indelible image of hope, however bittersweet."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they spend their meagre savings on the purchase of an old car to take them to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.The novel tells the story of a journey, and there are echoes of two other well-known stories about journeys; the Biblical book of Exodus and the true historical story of the nineteenth century American pioneers who opened up the West. Like their ancestors, the Okies, as the migrant workers become known, travel westwards in search of a better life. Like the Children of Israel, they journey out of what they perceive as a land of bondage towards what they see as a Promised Land. There are other echoes of the Bible in the book. The very title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from a line in The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a poem which uses Biblical language and imagery to convey America's vision of itself as a land of freedom. Several of the Joad family have Christian names taken from the Old Testament (Noah, Ruth, Rose of Sharon). Their friend Jim Casy, a former preacher who has started to doubt his former religious beliefs, nevertheless takes on an increasingly prophetic role as the story progresses. (He significantly has the same initials as Jesus Christ).In the Bible, of course, the Children of Israel did indeed reach the Promised Land after years of wandering in the wilderness, and many of the pioneers, despite dangers and hardship, did succeed in making better lives for themselves. In the novel, there is no such happy ending for the Joads or for the others who travel the same route. Steinbeck alternates between longer chapters, narrating the story of the Joads themselves, and shorter ones commenting on the general situation of the Okies. These shorter chapters are often used as vehicles for the author's left-wing political opinions, as he attacks the various individuals and corporations who have contributed to the plight of the dispossessed. The banks and landlords, in their desire for profit, force the tenant farmers off their land. The big Californian landowners lure them with misleading advertising promising abundant well-paid work, hoping to create a labour surplus and thereby keep wages down. The motor dealers exploit their desperation to get to California by selling them overpriced, unroadworthy vehicles, which they can only afford by selling off their few remaining possessions. When they try to dispose of these, however, they find that the dealers in second-hand goods are not prepared to offer anything other than rock-bottom prices. In California itself, the agricultural employers try to keep wages as low as possible, and vigorously resist, aided by a brutal police force, any attempts on the part of their workers to form unions or to combine to raise wages. Neither the State authorities nor the ordinary people of California welcome the newcomers in their midst, seeing them as a threat to either public order or to their living standards. The result is that the Okies lead a life of great hardship, living in squalid accommodation, desperately seeking work, however low-paid, in order to keep themselves from starving.As I said, there is no happy ending for the Joads, or even a hopeful one. Indeed, there is not even an unhappy or tragic resolution to their situation. The final image of the novel is the striking one Rose of Sharon using her breast milk, after giving birth to stillborn child, to feed a dying man. There is, however, no definite conclusion to the story of the family as a whole. We do not hear what becomes of Noah, who leaves the family shortly after their arrival in California, or of his brother Tom, who has gone on the run after killing a man, or of Rose of Sharon's husband, who has abandoned her. This lack of a definite ending is not, in my view, a fault. In other works of fiction, such as \\"The Pearl\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", Steinbeck showed that he was well able to write logical, satisfying endings to stories when need be. His failure to provide such an ending to the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" was quite deliberate. There is no conclusion to the story of the Joads because there is no conclusion to the story of the Okies. Their tomorrow will be the same as their today; a desperate struggle for the basic necessities of life.In some ways- his indignation, his social concerns and in the clarity of his prose- Steinbeck reminds me of his British contemporary George Orwell. Certain passages struck me as particularly fine pieces of descriptive or polemical writing- notably the opening chapter, which describes the harsh drought which led to the creation of the Dust Bowl, and Chapter 25, in which the author contrasts the beauty and fruitfulness of the California landscape with the inhumanity of the big landowners, wilfully destroying their produce to keep prices high while other men go hungry.Criticisms have been made that not all economic migrants to California during the thirties suffered the same hardships as the Joads and that many of them actually did manage to find well-paid work and to raise their standards of living. It has also been claimed that not all Californians were as unwelcoming or hostile to the newcomers as those shown in the book. There may be some truth in these claims, but to dismiss the book on these grounds is no more reasonable than to refuse to read Dickens on the grounds that not all Victorian boarding-schools were as bad as Dotheboys Hall and not all factory owners as stony-hearted as Mr Bounderby. There can be no denying that the Depression was a time of poverty and hardship for many, and Steinbeck's novel is possibly the most powerful and memorable fictional evocation of that era. Its place as one of the classics of twentieth-century American literature is a deserved one."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a fictionalized account of the plight of migrant farm workers in California during the Great Depression. Dust storms and poor irrigation have turned large areas of farmland in the prairie states into a Dust Bowl. Tenant farmers, unable to grow crops and pay rent to their landlords, have been forced off their land by the banks. The starving farmers are lured to California by the promise of plentiful fruit-picking jobs, only to find it an unattainable paradise.The novel follows the pilgrimage of an Oklahoma family named the Joads and their friend, a former preacher named Jim Casy. When the novel begins, Tom Joad has just gotten out of prison and returns home to find that his family is one of the many that have been dispossessed by the land-owning company. They are preparing to drive to California to seek better farming opportunities. The road to California is a wasteland of unfriendly cops, opportunistic salesmen, unemployed drifters, and lonely souls, all seen from the vista of the Joads' rickety truck. The chapters alternate between the Joads' specific experiences and interludes that give a sort of large-scale third-party perspective to the general plight of the land and the people.Once in the fertile valleys of central California, the Joads learn the reality of the job situation: The farm owners have lured many more people than necessary to fill the available jobs, so they get to hire those who are willing to work for the least money. The surplus of migrant farm workers group together in encampments called Hoovervilles and wait desperately for news about new jobs, while they are forced to face the hostility of the locals who call them &quot;Okies&quot; and consider them wage-deflating scabs. The living conditions are deplorable and the Joads can barely afford the most meager of food.The Joads eventually find work picking peaches at a large farm that operates almost like a labor camp, with armed guards stationed around to ensure there are no worker uprisings. It is here that Casy, who has been rallying for worker unionization, is martyrized when he is killed by a goon trying to break up a worker strike. Towards the end of the book, in Tom's &quot;farewell&quot; speech to his mother, Steinbeck conveys his message of the importance of worker organization and unionization to prevent exploitation by employers.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is thoroughly depressing to the very end. It has been accused of being too didactic and heavy-handed, but it's a book that needed to be written and one that took a lot of guts to do so. Who else but Steinbeck could have treated the downtrodden with so much dignity and sympathy without being condescending? Who else could have invested so much detail in even the seemingly least important characters, such as the one-eyed man in the junkyard, the storekeeper at the peach farm, and the fervently religious Lisbeth Sandry, making them unforgettable symbols of humanity? This book is an education. After reading it, everything else seems shallow."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book brings one of the most inaccessible disasters of the 20th century, the Dust Bowl, into focus. What a mean coincidence that it had to happen when banks were going through tough times. This book, perhaps Steinbeck's best, brings the personal melodrama of Of Mice and Men on the road with a family of 14 Oklahomans. Meet the Joads, who have lived on the same land for many generations. They have killed for the land and have died for it. The bank has forclosed on the home loan, and they have been pushed out. Now they gather all they can carry with them, sell all they can't, and hit the road in a rickety car and with only about a hundred dollars and wild hopes. Grandma and Grampa are the stern, traditional voice of the family, Ma and Pa lead the family in their oddysey west, Uncle John is a booze hound with strength and grit, Noah is a strange individualist, Al is the testosterone filled young man, Tom is an ex-con who just happens to be the pragmatist and clearest thinker, Ruthie and Winfield are the wild kids, and Connie and Rose are newlyweds. I know I am forgetting someone. The book is divided into two parts: the journey to California and their heartbreaking quest to make a living. It just happens that they are members of an outcast society despised by everyone. Throughout the book they are run out of settlements, antagonized and harassed, and mistreated. A member of the oddysey is Jim Casy, a former preacher. Casy turns himself in for beating a deputy to keep Tom from getting turned in and in prison meets a man who wants to end the victimization of migrant workers. He wants to form unions. While protesting against a peach orchard (that the Joads just happen to be at) he is killed by corrupt deputies. The book is shattering in so many ways: the way the Joads are treated, how the migrants at large are treated by the cops and by the rich malevolents, and how the general people allowed themselves to be blinded by bitterness and hate. There are several deeply affecting passages: one where a bunch of oranges are dumped in a vacant area behind a Hooverville (where 'Okies' lived), then kerosene was dumped on them so that the impoverished Okies couldn't eat them; the part in which the deputies send in a starving guy to start a fight in a government camp so they can break it up (because the government camp is treating Okies like humans), one man owning a million acres and not even farming it, just owning it so he can say he owns it. These concepts of gluttony and cruelty are more than the poor migrants can take. I absolutely loved the book and think every person should read it: it shows what happens when ordinary people are hated, and how devastating and frivilous that hate can be."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where none exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book to go out and buy a copy - any old copy, and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"When I was a kid Steinbeck was one of my favorite authors. His observations always touched a nerve with me, and his characters always came alive, as the clich&eacute; goes. His stories were simple enough, the masterpiece Grapes of Wrath included, that the story enthralled me at the time, even if the politics somewhat escaped me.As most know, GOW is the story of undeserved poverty come to rest on an undeserving family. On the injustice of a capitalistic and bureaucratic society and the probable indifference of a not so loving God. Whether you reach Steinbeck's conclusions, and I personally don't, you can't escape how real the stories are themselves, how well told and entertaining and even humorous the most pointless and melancholic of human events can be.I remember as a high school kid being most disturbed by the government's attempt to battle the depression in the government's anti-common-sense way. With people literally starving to death the government, at the same time they gave handouts, were pouring kerosene on oranges and even shooting illegal \\"harvesters\\". It is hard to fathom today, the starvation I mean, not the logic twists of bureaucracy.There is a little something for everyone, for those who hate big business especially, but the government is not portrayed as much of a savior, either. If you need a happy ending this is not the book for you, but if you want one of the great American epics and a gritty slice of American history, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Although it is a little slow going at the start, once you have met all the chraracters, and the main story starts, it is actually painful to put down. John Steinbecks vivid writnig keeps you engrossed in the story, and gives the reader a clear mental picture. Having also read Of Mice and Men, I expected to get that mental picture and to be severely moved by the story. All my expectations were met. He also has a writing style that lets one get close to the characters. He has a way of making the reader really care about them. He makes the reader feel as if they are actually there, feeling what the characters feel. Although The Grapes of Wrath left me feeling quite sad and angry, I was thankful for having read it. It was very well written and an influential story. It had a positive impact on me.

The hardships that the Joads and the other displaced people is horrible. As a reader you start to sympathize with the 'Okies' and my animosity towards the Calfornia farmers grew. That is until you read a brief chapter on the issues that are driving the farmers. The state of the US economy is driving the farmers to let produce rot rather than be harvested. For the people who are starving this is another slap in the face.In reading this tale, I wondered how I would have dealt with trying to provide for my family.

'the grapes of wrath' is certainly no exception. some readers may be put off by the book's length, or its decidedly 'okie' dialect. sure, it can be a bit tough to follow sometimes, but a couple dozen pages into the novel it's not too difficult to pick up on the dialect. and the book is quite simple to read and follow. it takes a master to keep is simple, yet profound.in 'the grapes of wrath' steinbeck once again proves he's the master of the moral dilemma--yet he doesn't dare presume to offer any answers. he puts his characters in situations and lets them succeed or fail (and they often do fail). it's one of the beauties of steinbeck's writing. while we tend to pull for his characters, we know they're as deeply flawed as they are--and perhaps that's why do we care as much as we do.the novel opens with tom joad jr's release from prison for homicide, continues through the joad's departure to california and their ultimate arrival in california and all the accompanying trouble. steinbeck, perhaps better than anyone before or since, captures the essence of america. what does it mean to be an american? what did it mean to be an american during the depression? how do we, as americans, treat our fellow citizens? what are our rights and obligations as citizens of this great country? as i mentioned earlier, steinbeck offers no answers--but eloquently poses the questions (as any good literature worth its salt will do). in many ways the joads are the quintessential american family, warts and all.what surprised me most, however, about 'the grapes of wrath' is that it's very much a story about matriarchy and the power of women. ma joad is one of the strongest women i've read about in literature. her's are the most heartbreaking scenes (when they're stopped at the border; when rose of sharon gives birth; when tom jr repeats his crime), yet she always comes out stronger and wiser. it's ma joad who herds the family. it's ma joad who looks after the men in her family. it's ma joad who understands why her husband and children behave the way they do. she's literally the glue that keeps the family together. i applaud steinbeck for writing such a profoundly wonderful, complex, and postive female character during a time when a lot of writers seemed to treat women as afterthoughts (hemingway?).there's much to admire in steinbeck's writing. as a writer, he's nearly unmatched. as a social commentator, he's peerless. as an advocate for the underpriviledged, displanced, and desperate, he's the master."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"When was the last time you read The Grapes of Wrath? I myself had not picked it up since I first read it, more than thirty years ago. I remembered the bare outlines of the plot, including the famous last scene, but little more. This time, I was struck by the force of many scenes: the brutality of the tractors that tear through the homes of tenant farmers, the plain rendering of the little caf&eacute; on the road to California, the small luxuries at the government camp in California. The characterization of Ma Joad as she struggles to feed her family is unforgettable. Most of all, I admired Steinbeck's handling of tone. The novel interweaves chapters of more general socio-economic observation into the story of the Joads. These chapters are angry ones, but Steinbeck does not permit his anger to warp his story. A lesser writer might have sentimentalized the Joads, but Steinbeck never does it, and that's what makes this a novel you should pick up once again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a novel that generated many varying reactions from me, and although I enjoyed reading it, I have mixed emotions about it.The book is undeniably well written, with Steinbeck alternating a chapter of narrative that focuses on the Joad family with a short chapter about the migrant movement of the thirties as a whole. The chapters about the migrant movement are almost poetry. Although some leave something to be desired others simply soar with excellence. At first I was annoyed by this organization, as I was drawn into the story of the Joad family and hated being taken from it, but then as the novel progressed I got used to the alternating chapter focus and I began to like it. After finishing the text I can't imagine the novel without it.The novel's strongest point is the characterization of the Joad family. Mr. Steinbeck has a wonderful gift of creating stark full characters with an economical use of prose. He \\"shows\\" us these people, he does not tell us about them. It is almost like you are peeping into their minds and lives, and accordingly there are many moments where much is left unstated. But Steinbeck has created such textured characters you know what has been left unsaid and have already filled in the blanks.I loved the character of Ma Joad and her simple philosophy of life. She swings from the heights of authority to the shadows of self doubt with such fluidity and simplicity that she reeks of reality, and personally I found Steinbeck's first description of her (on page 74 in the centennial edition) to be some of the finest character writing I have come across in a novel.Many readers are irritated by Steinbeck's overt socialism in the text, and I admit it is obnoxious at times, but I was not so bothered by it that I had to stop reading. I am not even sure that Steinbeck is extolling socialism as much as he is preaching the \\"golden rule\\". Rather, what I was more bothered by was his lazy characterization of people with money. If you are a banker, or a corporate farmer, or someone with money you are bad, period and nothing further need be said. Contrasted with the rich characterization he did with other characters (specifically the Joad family) I was annoyed by this lazy attempt at one dimensional characterization. It takes away from the humanity of all people, which I think is counter to one of the book's prevalent themes.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an astounding text, and one that I found to be gripping and human. Despite some flaws it's themes of the resiliency of the human spirit and the strength to be found in family is needed and relevant. I was so wrapped up the in the last 150 pages of the text that I had to keep reading. What I was reading was wonderful and terrifying at the same time, and this epic (almost Biblical) tale merits your attention."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath for my AP English class, and it was a struggle to start, but at the end even I was swayed by its mastery.It's very depressing, cruel and harshly realistic about the Dust Bowl and Okalahoman farmers moving to California. California, to look for a new beginning, is their destination. And along the way, it's all about the struggles as humans they go through, their self sacrifices, soul searching and willingness to band together just to get through it alive.If nothing, Grapes of Wrath is moving, and heartbreaking but tedious with description and choke full of lengthy descriptions. I don't recommend this if you absolutely hate historical fiction, as it takes a certain preference of historical fiction to enjoy this novel. I liked it in the end. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for historical fiction, maybe it's because I was forced to read it, but I enjoyed it. I don't think I could've grasped the symbolic Christian references - and I think it would be much more appreciated by a more worldly, older generation than mine.Regardless, try it. It's a classic anyway, there must be a reason for that. Maybe you'll even like it at the end like me."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Used book in good shape, just what we were looking for instead of buying new.Book arrived quickly.

This is a novel I had been told to read for years. I heard from everyone how much I would love it. So I tried several times and just could not get into it. It didn't grab me right from the start as some stories do. Then, one day, I decided to give it one last try. For whatever reason I was finally ready and wow, did I love it! The plight of the Joad family evoked such a combination of despair and hope that I felt as though my heart would burst. I had read Steinbeck before, (\\"East of Eden\\" is one of my favorites), but \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is so relevant to the present economic situation in this country that it really struck a chord with me. I imagine there are many American families living a modern-day version of this story. Steinbeck was a master and his vision extends into a future we can only imagine. I don't think you can rate this novel on the same scale as other works sold on Amazon. If I could I would give it ten stars, at least."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I recently read John Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\", which I also highly recommend. Though I've seen the movie, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", many times I decided to read the book. It is exquisite literature and the kind of writing we do not see enough of these days with formulated novels that are, in fact, screen plays waiting to happen. I encourage anyone who has reverence for words, to read this stunning novel for every word, line, and paragraph yields a poetic depth, understanding, and insight into an important part of our country's history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I had always thought of myself as lucky for avoiding authors like Steinbeck and Fitzgerald in both high school and college, but after reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", I realize now I did myself a service. Being below the age of 18 in high school, and still being financially supported by my parents in college, I would have probably knocked the book. I think the themes in the book are so complex and so adult that there is definitely a maturity level that needs to be reached to appreciate the book.Steinbeck does an excellent job of relating to the Joad's struggles, painting a picture of the depression, and truly captures the pain and reality of the travels to the west in 1939. Just from reading the book made the depression so much more alive where I could feel the Joad's heartbreak. I was just sick reading about the treatment of the people, but relieved to see the acts of kindness done throughout the novel. My favorite character was by far Ma. She set an example of how to keep a family together and the true definition of a humanitarian.

It is excellent through and through. I know this is a book that is commonly read in high school. Since I did not read when I was young I deprived my self of some great reading. The begining I thought was slow, until the story hits the road, then I start to really feel their plight. My father had worked in real life in a apple cannery in California for a short time, he always said the \\"Okies\\" were some of the nicest most generous people you would ever want to meet. It is certainly ironic to read a book about oppression and discrimination by white people and to see that it is the same race of people who treat them as animals. That tells me that racism is much deeper than the color of your skin. If everybody read this, perhaps people would be more tolerent and compasionate, I know this is how the book made me feel. The end is tragic but so were the lives of many of these real Americans who were displaced by the Dustbowl."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The story unfolded with a vivid depiction of the state of Oklahoma land. Weather was scorchingly hot and dry, land was parched and harvests were unsatisfactory. To the Joad family, their livelihood, well-being, families, and happiness - in short, their everything - all hinge on the cultivation of that piece of land. However, they were forced to move west in search of money and food when their land was taken over by the bank, symbolized by the tractor. The early chapters of the book hence gave a poignant portrayal of the encroachment of capitalism on a largely agrarian society and the resulting clash between workers and owners of the land. As the families moved westwards they encountered various problems, such as lack of food, low wages, floods, torrential rains and unreasonable policeman. Yet they did not give up.John Steinbeck ended the story with finesse (I shan't elaborate on this here, lest it spoils your reading experience), further reaffirming the central message of the book - the triumph of human dignity, determination and perseverance. The story did not end with the Joad family making big money, transforming themselves from rags to riches. The writer chose to end it in a more subtle way, leaving room for readers to imagine. \`Grapes of Wrath' also paid tribute to motherhood, as Tom Joad's mother rose to become the figure of authority in the family, giving support and charting the direction forward for the family in the later part of the book.I like the way John Steinbeck incorporated detached, short and sweet third person narratives into the story, giving it a fuller and more complete touch. I also fancy the dialogues, and the interplay between the imagery of the environment/weather and the development of the storyline. In all, I enjoyed reading \`grapes of wrath'. A very apt metaphoric title indeed, for anger was brewing in the hearts and minds of the migrant family who helped pick the grapes that were in abundance in the orchards, but yet did not get to eat them.P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s. Is the writer trying to mock at capitalism gone wrong? Do segments of the story not sound like a reversal of the American ideals of freedom, liberty and equality? A reflection of the state of American society after the great depression??"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"Wow, This book is boring\\"--Thats what I was like after reading this book for 1 hour (I only got 17 pages read).

Steinbeck does a good job of holding the readers attention after like the first 50 pages of the book. You learn history, and you get a great novel ALL IN ONE! People, I urge you to read this book, do not be afraid of the first 50 pages (they will lead you to the good part).

It does not fail to leaves its mark on a reader. This serious master-piece has its setting during the \\"Great Depression\\" and gives a general view of the 1930's. John Steinbeck who may be the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm wrote this THE GRAPES OF WRATH which is about the struggles of the poor during this time. In the story, the Joad family endures many struggles on their way to find work in California and their lives are a microcosm of struggles of the poor during this time. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, betrayals, setbacks and despair. Yet the Joads maintained dignity, courage, and hope to recover. America was fortunate in that the poor did maintain these virtues which kept their hopes alive and made them not to rebel and throw the nation into anarchy. The nation was also lucky with the ascension to power of Roosevelt. THE GRAPES OF WRATH shows how a people with hope and a leadership committed to its people can overcome disaster to become strong again.Itrreads in so many ways like Disciples of Fortune and the writing flows in an effortless manne"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a classic and a must-have must-read for everyone with an interest in good books.

An extremely sad journey through it's pages, you just want the journey to end and the book to be over. This book is beatifully written as I knew it would be. The opening chapter is awesomely written and the tragic Joad family are of course wonderful. Despite the critical introduction I never felt preached to and never felt that dialogue from the Joad family was over and above what you'll get from semi-literate, poverty stricken folk.I don't understand why the publishers allowed such a snobby guy to give the introduction which, before I knew it, told me the ending. How stupid can you get? I'd advise you to read the book BEFORE the intro and make your own mind up BEFORE the intro. This book is one of the reasons I love books. It opened up a little world in my mind that I never knew existed in 1930's America. And I keep talking about it to people and comparing it to the world today. Hope you get it.The book is about farm labourers, small-time plot holders who's livelihoods have been taken away by the coming of the tractors and 1930's Depression. These people have been born and brought up to live off the land, ploughing, sewing etc and NOTHING ELSE. So,skill-less,homeless, hungry, desperate and financially broke they migrate West under promises of work in the West and streets lined with Orange trees. Unfortunately, there's half a million people migrating and not nearly enough work. When the family leave Oaklahoma, Buisnessmen use their desperation to bargain down the worth of their lifes belongings and, when they travel they are told early that buisnessmen use the huge numbers of people, and their hunger and desperation, to lower wages. This book made me hate certain aspects of human nature-competition, survival of the fittest, progress etc. But you will love and admire the Joad family.In all, an intense beautifully written story that had me hungry for every word."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this classic.

The vivid images of this great book showed a farming family forced to move out for a better chance at life, and then fail at the end. It makes you feel as if you are really there. The Great Depression was a cruel, foolish discriminating event on the innocent Americans. It was also very difficult to see proud Americans being significantly reduced to nothing at all.

How can anyone expect a teenager from today's hurry up, rush rush, society to enjoy a book that develops as slowly as The Grapes of Wrath. And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages.

But they find out a lot more than what they thought about the promised land called California when they finally get there. they get treated with disrespect by the people who live there, calling them and many other outsiders from Oklahoma 'Okies' and being pushed around by the deputies. They started out as a big family, then lost members throughout the novel. the book also has some 'interchapters' by the author to show us what happened during the depression.To me, Steinbeck's novel was both good and boring.Good, because it was a good story, with perfect detail and well-crafted characters. It was also structured really well, with the dialect the author used for the characters to make them realistic. I think Steinbeck did a great job with this work, different from Of Mice and Men and The Pearl.This novel was also boring because of the interchapters. one, they have nothing to do with the actual story. And two, they have paragraphs that just puts me to sleep. I know they're there just to show us what's going on during the story, but still, it just loses my interest.Overall, The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinback at his finest.

I have a natural interest with American history, and my main interest is in the early 20th century during the 20s-40s. This book does a wonderful job at portraying that time period, as well as realizing what life was like for your average working man during our countries worst economic decade. People were fired and lost their land, people traveled across the country to find minimum wage jobs to support their families, people dies and lost family memebers on the way, people broke the law and commited suicide to cope, and people were miserable on top of all this. The characters aren't too boring, and go through some of the depressions worst moments. This book also shows the brutality of the government and how they would force people out of nice camps and jail them just for voicing their opinions. In the end, nothing changes, and everyone is as bad off as when they started off, if not worse. They are without a home, job, or decent meals, and this is all shown very clearly throughout the novel, as well as how Americans worked together to support each other with humane acts to hopefully make it out of the depression and regain their homes and jobs."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is an astonishing book, a spellbinder like today's mysteries, but with a social conscience.

I finished the audio book, narrated by Dylan Baker, some 2 weeks ago, and its sad irony and humanity still resonate with me.However, this scene is just one of dozens evoking the depths of human hope and sorrow. If you haven't read the Grapes of Wrath, it's a journey like no other; not just into the human spirit, but into our nation's history, including vivid portrayals of farm foreclosure, migrant labor, and economics and social events that gave rise to organized labor.In addition to delivering highly memorable characters and scenes, Steinbeck offers an unusual but very effective structural device - narrative passages about primary characters are interspersed with passages from third-party perspectives, often resembling discrete short-stories, for example,- a property manager evicting a disbelieving farmer from his land- a salesman selling a used car to a desperate family heading West- family farms collapsing in the wake of farm-automation and vertically-integrated farm-canneries- a stolid turtle trudging along an Oklahoma dust bowl roadAll-in-all, The Grapes of Wrath is a feast for the mind and imagination, as much a must-read as say, the Catcher in the Rye.Dylan Baker's audio CD narration is outstanding. Like a great narrator, he's equally effective voicing male and female characters, conveying emotional depth without becoming maudlin, and maintain a good pace.

Unfortunately they are met with hardship, contempt, injustice, corruption, greed, prejudice and hunger to name a few.

But my Book Club, some 50 years later, decided to read it again. We were captivated! Mesmerized by the strength of Ma. Swept along Route 66 in a jalopy carrying a dozen. Enlightened by the cruel methods employed by the Oklahoma, Kansas and California land owners. Wanting, at the end, to read a sequel to find out what happened to Tom and the 300,000 other \\"Okies\\" who just wanted to work hard at what they knew best, farming."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a long book about the 1930's. It involves the main character of the story, Tom Joad, leaving prison and going back home to his family's house in Oklahoma, when he finds out they've left because of the dust bowl. When he catches up with them, they're packing up to go to California. A lot of the book is about them going to California, and them trying to settle down. Some of the chapters in the book are symbolic, and represent Steinbeck's leftist ideals. A lot of the people here seem to give the book a 1 star review because they can't appreciate the symbolic meaning of the turtle, and of other things.If you're intelligent enough to grasp the concept of symbols, you will definitely like this book.And yes, there is a lot of cussing in here. And know what? They're just words. Calm down.One last thing. The ending of the book is really, really shocking. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"So you're probably wondering, why such a downer title, and yet he gave it four stars? Well, if you're willing to be your own editor, you can turn this into a terrific novel or into a moving essay. But, Steinbeck has combined both, and in today's time, this pairing drives down the pace of both. Steinbeck's writing pattern is immediatly apparent: He alternates between an essay dealing in generalities of the situation with the tale of the Joad family specifically living the conditions he has laid out in the essay. Of course he did that, because he was trying to educate the bulk of America to the condition the migrant workers were facing in California. If he just told Joad's story, readers might think it is a situation peculiar to only one family. But, by pairing the Joad episodes with the broader essays, he shows that their desperate situation is shared by thousands of other families. Each of the essay/story telling sections are easy to dissect, so I suggest the reader who is interested in the compelling story of the Joads skip the essay segments. I read both in order, and found myself impatient with the essays and wanting to get back to the Joads. However, the essays are beautifully and powerfully written and important in their time before Caesar Chavez, so the next time I pick up this book, I believe I will just read the essay sections, then read the Joad sections. I also highly recommend the movie version of this book which starred Henry Fonda. The book and movie are quite similar in their plots with some exceptions that are interesting to think about. There are a number of minor characters and situations in the book that didn't make the movie. One of Steinbeck's themes from the book that didn't see light of the silver screen is that the head of the family was changing from a male to female as the adversities became harder to overcome. The movie ends on somewhat of a positive note with Henry Fonda's \\"I'll be there\\" speech. On the other hand, the book ends with a hell-bent-for-leather finale, none of which made the movie, including the haunting climax. And unlike the movie, the book shows no promise of a brighter future."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The book relates the tragic destiny of one family after the great depression in 1929, when million of American workers became unemployed. this family had been abased, and went to the california to get a life better.

I can't agree completely with that. Grapes of Wrath is an important expose of the way simple people were affected by the Great Depression and industrial changes to the agricultural sector. Overly sentimental and melodramatic at times, it is true that Steinbeck exploits the sad nature of his lowly characters to elicit pity. Still, I found his style clear and the plot interesting enough to overlook these deficiencies. The narrator documents the trip down Route 66 of an Oklahoma dust farm family. They are headed toward California dreams and encounter much adversity along the way. I think the book should be read as a relevant period piece and enjoyed as an American family saga."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Thats what it is a good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this book&gt;"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is an important book because it fictionalized an important historical movement. However, it is quite dull and dismal.The story revolves around the Joad family, a group who has been uprooted from their home and decides to move to California where there are oranges and opportunities. They endure hardships including death, poverty and prejudice. The scenes are filled with dirt and barren landscapes. It is hard to like the family because they're absolutely pathetic and it is hard not to like them either for the same reason. One just rolls along the story with them not caring much what happens or what doesn't happen.The book is full of symbols that are presented for the reader to interpret any way they'd like. Steinbeck used these symbols to put forth his points about humanity in a subtle way so that one is not overwhelmed. One symbol is the dust that creates a haze over the world. It foreshadows the discomfort and irritation of a new life and obliterates view of the past. The wind that blew the dust pushed the family toward California in hopes of a better life. The highway symbolizes the journey taken by the families toward California. It is the progression of life, the never-ending struggle that all must endure. The grapes from the title of the book were referenced in a scene in which they were crushed to starve the Okies. The juice from these grapes symbolizes the blood that was shed while fighting injustice. In Christianity, grape juice and wine are used in communion as the blood of Christ. The wealthy squeezed the grapes to expel the juices into the streets so that the common people had no access to it, preventing religion and good from the migrants.Overall, this book employs tools of great writers and is certainly historically important. However, it is difficult for one to want to read this sort of book if it is not entertaining. This void is the book's major weakness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I loved this book!

It is not a book for the immature, and Steinbeck applies all the sensitive subjects that Knee Jerk Right Wingers see fit for book banning.

But this is true: &quot;Grapes&quot; is America's greatest novel, and nothing is its equal. I love this book for its form and style, its language, its simplicity, its symbolism, its characters, plot and dialogue and its meaning layered on meaning that never disappoints; each new reading reveals something new and profound about you, the reader; we, both as a formed society and as human beings as a timeless whole, and the forces outside of ourselves that compel us to either make choices or just hang on until the ride is over. My last reading gave me the impression that &quot;Grapes&quot; illustrates that, at bottom, human beings are both the best and worst of all creations, and that the choice is always ours which of those characteristics we will put forth in any given instant in our lives; whether or not life favors me today, I can still choose to give my best to others and myself. Our free will cannot be quashed. In this fatalistic world, I appreciate Steinbeck's demonstration of this through the Joad family, who, when the indifferent world asked them to die and get it over with, refused, and went gallantly on. This is life-affirming art at its best, a classic that fits the definition: it rewards reinspection."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.

Even something as simple as a toilet, a place to stay and food to eat.

Steinbeck isn't difficult stuff, people. The language is far from that horribly stuffy Charles Dickens crap; rather, it's closer in style and elegant simplicity to the pinnacle of 19th-century American literature, Mark Twain. The dialogue is NOT trite, it's sparse. The descriptive passages are NOT monotonous, they're stark and yet detailed. The plot is NOT far-fetched, it's based on a journey undertaken by thousands of discontented pilgrims.I will not go so far as to call this work the Greatest American Novel, or even the Greatest American Novel of the Twentieth Century. It's up there, without a doubt, if only because of its social influence and the underbelly that it exposes. But in addition to being one of the GREATEST books, it is also one of the BEST books. It's genuinely interesting...gripping...engaging. I read it a few years ago, I think during the summer between the 10th and 11th grades, and I could barely put it down. It's one of those rare novels: a page-turner, yet with prose sometimes delicious enough to roll through your imagination a few times, savoring the language composition. And after you've finished reading, you find that the novel has left you profoundly affected.So it's not just a Great Book; it's a really really good book as well. It's powerful, it's enjoyable on every level. Read it and be changed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I will never forget how this book captivated me in so many ways. An American classic that will stand the test of time. I got the pleasure of being assigned this book in 10th grade as part of literature class. I was forever changed by this book, and helped fuel me to read more challenging books.John Steinbeck helped me to realize the poverty, the trangressions, and some hope of the Depression. It helped put me in focus with the pride problems that the family had during the collapse of an entire society during America's most trying times. It is well written and very captivating. It had me in tears more than once. It also reads much like The Bible at times, in its prose and style. It catalogs a family's journey from farmers to migrant workers that is easily readable and a classic that helped define a generation.A great book- and a must have."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I hungrily devoured this book, and yet, several times, I had to stop to digest the depth and import of a few simple words. Steinbeck is commenting on industrialization, big business killing small business, environmentalism, family, the extended family of the human race...all in an allegory of Exodus and Jesus Christ's life. I can't think of a more timely message for the modern world. The symbolism was a bit obvious at times, but there were also more subtle areas in which he left you with just a hint of import until you were able to analyze it more fully. The ending gives new meaning to the Milk of Human Kindness. I absolutely recommend this, but at least a basic background in the history of the Dust Bowl and Depression are recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A Review of The Grapes of Wrath by John SteinbeckI am not an economist so I am not even going to try to understand the economic mess were are in as a nation - but I cannot help but think about The Grapes of Wrath and the odyssey of the Joad family when I think about our current financial times. Massive debt. Budget shortages. Home foreclosures. Business failures. Bankruptcies. Job losses. In some ways I feel that we are all (well many of us) Joad's now - trapped in a financial system that we do not understand, trying to make a daily living, but always feeling that we are taking one step up and two back.My favorite scene in The Grapes of Wrath was early in the book, when a tenant farmer is trying to stop his home and land from being plowed over by tractor-operator hired by the bank. This is a man he knows, a local, who has taken a job with the bank to gain a regular salary and some stability for his family. But, this stability comes with a huge price. His job is to repossess the land of his friends and neighbors and ready it to be turned over to the banks. How many of us would do the same? Life is a struggle and when money is tight we would do most anything to pay the bills and feed our own - but where do we draw the lines? The tenant wants to shoot him - but the man explains the truth - it's not him, not his fault - it's no one's fault - we are all ghosts in the money machine. This is a slice of that conversation:\\"It's not me. There's nothing I can do. I'll lose my job if I don't do it. And look -- suppose you kill me? They'll just hang you, but long before your hung there will be another guy on the tractor, and he'll bump the house down. You're not killing the right guy.\\"\\"That's so,\\" the tenant said. \\"Who gave you orders? I'll go after him. He's the one to kill.\\"\\"You're wrong. He got his orders from the bank. The bank told them: \\"Clear those people out or it's your job.\\"\\"Well, there's a president of the bank. There's a Board of Directors. I'll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank.\\"The driver said: \\"Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the East. The orders were:\\"Make the land show profit or we'll close you up.\\"\\"But where does it stop? Who can we shoot? I don't aim to starve to death before I kill the man that's starving me.\\"\\"I don't know. Maybe there's nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn't man at all. Maybe, like you said, the property's doing it. Anyway I told you my orders.\\"The financial machine we live inside often challenges our morality, our faith, our ethics in exchange for a paycheck. Think Glengarry Glen Ross, think sell or be fired, think it me or you and its not going to be me. So we take a nice long trip to Disney to forget all about it. Maybe we have a food drive at school - help the less fortunate. How are we supposed to live? Is this really it? Work your butt off, get as much as you can, hoard as much as you can - every man for himself. Really? The Joad's are not bums, not lazy, not moochers. They are simple folk who want to work - an honest days work for an honest days pay. But the fruit growers of this novel are the factories of Mexico, China, Vietnam, and every other \\"third world\\" country that produces our clothes, shoes, food and products. They are in a race to the bottom - pitted against one another for jobs - always pushed to do more for less. Why? So we can buy three dollar T-shirts at Wal-Mart.Don't get me wrong - I shop at Wal-Mart - we all do - we have to make our money stretch. We are all stuck. But can it change? As the tenant farmer went on to say:\\"I got to figure,\\" the tenant said. \\"We all got to figure. There's some way to stop this. It's not like lightning or earthquakes. We've got a bad thing made by men, and by God that's something we can change.\\"I think the beginning is within each of us - within me. We (I) made this mess - we (I am) are part of this mess. We (I) can change it by waking up, beginning to care and changing how we (I) live, think and treat one another - today. We (I) need to begin to want less, expect less and need less. This concept is antithetical in a society based on consumption - but will help forge a world that is more humane and loving. It is time to withdraw from the \\"Grand Illusion\\", to unplug the television, cancel your (my) subscription to all your (my) magazines, especially - \\"You're Not Skinny Enough\\" Monthly, \\"My House is Perfect - What's Up With Yours\\" Weekly and \\"Look How Rich I Am\\" Daily - shut it off - go outside, appreciate what you have, love one another, seek God and be what he has commanded us to be in this life - witnesses to his Word, not buyers of more garbage. As Americans we need to see ourselves for what we are - from a global perspective - we are the rich oppressors. Our want's, needs, desires, and struggles impact the world. We need to heed the following:\\"Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you. Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered innocent men, who were not opposing you.\\" - James 5: 1-6Although The Grapes of Wrath is a story about the Great Depression, it is a story of our lives - today. Many in this nation are doing very well - their houses keep getting bigger, their cars more expensive, their travel more extensive and their luxuries increase- but what about the rest. The Joad family represents \\"the rest.\\" All those people who have been foreclosed upon; laid off - forgotten. Where do they go? What do they do? Do we care?This is not a political perspective - politics do far more harm than good - nothing has been changed through legislation. Problems such as this require a change of the heart. It requires us to look each other in the eye - see one another as fellow humans - a mother, father, husband, wife, sister, brother, son, or daughter - not as a number or a servant. I believe that we as a nation will reap what we sow - it is for us to decide what that will be. Our final reward will be contingent on how we treated the least among us - every day. I am far from doing this - my eyes are just opening to my personal greed, narcissism and selfishness - but all change begins with the decision to change. What is your decision?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is an absolutely fantastic book illustrating the difficulties of many Americans during the depression (and the strength of a family to stick together and fight for each other). Though it is definitely not a page turner, and frequently slow, this is perhaps the only book I've read that I find myself frequently telling people they should read.I had a difficult time appreciating the book while reading it; however, I greatly appreciated it upon completion (about 4 years ago) and my appreciation keeps growing. I find the book to be very relevant and a good reminder of how life was for many just 80 years ago, especially when I hear people talking about how difficult or unfair things are today in the US. It's a sad reminder that, although I wouldn't wish the Joads' life on anyone, our society is far removed from the difficulties that instilled strength, resiliency, and a code of honor that made both that generation and this country great.I'm tempted to give this book 4 stars because it's slow and sometimes difficult to get through (though I am a fan of the chapter structure where Steinbeck alternates between long chapters involving the Joads and short anecdotes not involving the Joads but showing further insight into life during that time), but due to its impact on me and my continued frequent recommendation to others to read it, giving it less than 5 stars would be an injustice to this book. Also, I'm not sure who I would broadly recommend this book to, but I would not generally recommend it to younger audiences (who may lack sufficient insight into life and history) as I didn't read it until I was nearly 30 and still needed some time after reading it to fully appreciate it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother.

Because very little internal dialogue is presented, the Joads and other characters seem just plain stupid. However, by their actions one realizes they have a dignity and intelligence that is not obvious at first. They struggle against misfortune as best they can. In depicting the life of the Joads, the novel offers a vivid portrayal of the lives of many who suffered through the Great Depression. On a broader level this work also provides a commentary on government, religion, and politics. The climactic scene is meaningful but does not flow from the preceding chapters, and the ending is odd and will make you wonder what the message is.By the end of the novel, one may realize that this story is not just about the Joads, but a story of all Americans, no matter what the background. This is truly one of the greatest novels of American literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"My wife and I read this book while Hobo-ing around America picking fruits and vegetable in the 70's. We both really liked it. We saw the movie also.I'm am one of those who considers this to be Steinbeck's best. I've read several others by the author and I feel that this was far and away the deepest and the most dramatic. The ending I'm sure some would consider more appropriate in an ancient Greek tragedy but he made his point - one that I have always found very traditional and very difficult to swallow. But it is fundamental.This is without any doubt and American classic. In my opinion nothing that Mr. Steinbeck wrote after The Grapes Of Wrath is in the same class. I know that there are plenty out there who disagree but nevertheless that is my opinion.In this novel, everything is centered on the characters. There is little blatent philosophizing - the story tells the tale. There is no Steinbeck filler material. He had a story he wanted to tell and he told it. It was great.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is one of the best i have ever read...although you may have heard that a couple times already.

Steinbeck very movingly depicts the plight and the steadfastness of the displaced. Man versus Nature and Man's inhumanity to Man have never been better discussed. Extremely well-written, I enjoyed every word of the book even though this is the third time I've read it. Ma Joad becomes the de facto head of the &quot;fambly&quot; and her spirit is indomitable. The cruelty of &quot;the haves&quot; to &quot;the have-nots&quot; stabs one in the heart. Reading this work will leave one a better and more humble person. It will also remind one of hard times and the distinct possibilty such times could come again. Will our will to survive be as great as the &quot;Okies?&quot; I doubt it.This edition has fairly large print which makes it very easy on the eyes.I heartily recommend this towering work of Steinbeck's to young and old alike.

It is a powerful moving story that will make you wonder if things will get better or worse. The Grapes Of Wrath is considered to be a social protest by other reviews and I believe this is true for Steinbeck portrays the conditions that a migrant family workers had to go through. There were chapters in the book that were not about the migrant family and Steinbeck might have meant to do that so that readers will see the background of the story behind what's happening to the characters in the story and this also gives readers an idea about the history behind the novel that happened more than 60 years ago."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It is difficult to overstate the impact that this book had on the 16-year-old struggling with his identity that I was when I first read it in 1970. More so than Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, this masterpiece did so very much to awaken the social consciousness and activism in me. As a native Californian, I had actually been called an &quot;Okie&quot; as a small child but had no context to define the word.The other reviews I read praised the book's portrayal of the Joads to maintain human dignity despite disposession and prejudice that is very tangible. But I love the book for its spirituality as well. The continual references to God are unmistakable! The injustice is easily recognizable because God put His notion of justice in us. The Preacher, the real hero of the story, is sacrificed to the injustice.Sheer poetry, the book is a towering work that loses none of its impact with the passage of years."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book gave me an excellent portrayal of life during the Great Depression.

Steinbeck has created a vivid portrait combining both breath-taking and rough lyricism and a wonderful plot to create a master-piece of American fiction. With this book, Steinbeck has single handedly described what life was for &quot;Okies&quot; and has left no detail left out. For a seventeen year-old to be saying this about THE GRAPES OF WRATH, you know it must be good."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are the values upon which our country was founded. Yet history has shown that this has not been the case for many people living in the United States. Americans have been restricted from these rights because of unalterable circumstances such as race, sex, religion, or in the case of Grapes of Wrath, because of economic status. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck takes place during the 1930's, a time of nation wide economic hardship. Many books have been written about the great depression but this book is unique in its focus on another great tragedy effecting the country at the same time. The great dust bowl caused the migration of thousands of people from the Midwest US to the state of California in search of a better life for their families. This book addresses the hardships suffered by those families. This book is very effective in portraying these struggles both generally and personally. Steinbeck chose to alternate chapters between general descriptions of the country's struggles and the story of one specific family by the name of Joad. The general descriptions display the widespread difficulties people everywhere were suffering by describing the people as a general, family unit, &quot;And the man, the leader of the family, leaned from the car. Can we pull in here an sleep?&quot; (Steinbeck, p268) These chapters addressing the &quot;big picture&quot; were followed by chapters that brought the issue to life by displaying the struggles of the Joad family. This alternation of big picture, small picture story telling resulted in a well-rounded image of a time period in American history. So much can be gained from this book it is a definite asset to anyone's reading list. Not only is it a great chronicle of history, it is a story about the American dream, and the quality of life. The length of the book shouldn't provide an obstacle for a reader seeing as how it is neither exceptionally long nor short and it maintains a good amount of excitement and adventure throughout the novel. The only thing that may be distracting to some readers is the periodic breakaway from the main story line. However, if one can see this as a valuable literary device instead of an obstacle, it will actually provide a greater understanding of the time period. The Grapes of Wrath provides a great insight into a period of history. By reading the book, the reader is left with greater understanding and empathy for those who lived during the dust bowl of 1930. The bravery and strength that is demonstrated by the Joad family is both phenomenal and inspiring. It is a good example for people today who are suffering through difficult times. When these people where faced with hardship, they did not roll over and die. They picked up their lives and their families and they set out determined to find a way to protect and provide for themselves. At a time when everyday people in our country are turning to drugs, gangs, or crime as solutions to their problems, a great lesson can be learned from these families: The world is not perfect but that is no excuse to give up on life. And life was the picture John Steinbeck was trying to relay in his book. A raw, honest look at life during a time of great hardship and trial. The Joad family was an excellent portrayal of a typical family from the Midwest in search of the better life they had been promised elsewhere. Steinbeck characterized the family through dialogue that depicts both the diction and accent of a typical Midwest family in the 1930's, &quot; 'You jus' goin wes'?' 'Jus' on our way.' 'You ain't never been in California?'&quot; (278). Choosing to maintain the dialogue in this natural state adds to the authenticity of the novel and creates a better picture for the reader."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"You know it's an American classic, and everything that has been written about it being a great book that depicts an era in American history in a phenomenal way is true. I will just point out two things that I think the person who reads this book should know (especially if the reader is anything like me):1. The book starts out sort of slow. I read the beginning and wondered what I had gotten myself into. In fact, it started out so slow that I would have put it down had it not been required reading. I urge you to keep reading! The book is a classic for a reason, and it is good. Eventually, it turns into a real page-turner, and you want to find out what happens next to the Joad family. Later, you will want to check out what other people have said about this book. I never would have gotten all of the Biblical allusions or other symbolism without reading and discussing this book with others.2. The ending will surprise you. It shocked me. I definitely won't spoil it, but the ending of this book left me, quite literally, jaw wide open. WHAT? I thought. Oh my gosh! I was glad I had someone to talk about it with, because even in today's world, I'm sure most people would find it shocking. And it is nothing like the movie.That's my two cents. This book is a great addition to your literary knowledge, and if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it, from both the literary angle and the historical perspective."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Between 1936 and 1938, Steinbeck wrote a series of newspaper articles for the San Francisco News and the Monterey Trader about the horrendous plight of the migrant workers in California, many of whom arrived from Oklahoma, Texas, and beyond, seeking work during the \\"Dust Bowl migration\\" of the 1930s. (Earlier, he had written and published a novel \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" about labor unrest among those same migrant workers.) The fruit of Steinbeck\`s years mingling with these workers and investigating their conditions, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful and sympathetic fictional portrayal of one family's horrific odyssey across America in search of work after losing ownership of their farm.There is certainly more than one way to read this novel: as an incendiary historical document that galvanized the country (Eleanor Roosevelt and various politicians took up the cause of the migrant workers, while conservative-leaning groups and towns banned--or burned--the book); as an epic about human perseverance, survival, and dignity (reflected symbolically in the much-maligned \\"turtle chapter\\"); as a political manifesto unflinching in its condemnation of the insensitivities of corporate capitalism (for which Steinbeck was accused of Communist sympathies). Readers who find the novel unrelentingly depressing or unrealistic in its portrayal of the Joad family's fate should understand that the Joads were actually quite lucky. (Very few migrant families, for example, were fortunate enough to live in government camps.)The first hundred pages or so proceed rather slowly, in part because Steinbeck alternates the chapters about the Joad family with prosaic interludes describing the difficulties facing the migrant workers in general. But the pace of the novel accelerates (and the interludes become shorter), as various members of the Joad family experience frustration, sickness, brief periods of success, and death--never letting go of their dream of settling down somewhere and living in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable. (The two children are, well, just like children). The ending, which must have been scandalously shocking in the 1930s, is still electrifying; it forcefully shows the desperate lengths the poor were willing to go to help each other when most of America didn't care about their plight.This is my second time reading the novel, and--although I again found it gripping and moving--I was not as impressed as the first time I read it two decades ago. (I was much more idealistic then, I suppose.) One of the novel's greatest weaknesses is that Steinbeck overstates the evil machinations of the \\"bad guys\\" and the good-natured intentions of the \\"good guys.\\" All the police and the bankers and the landowners are thoroughly malevolent; all the displaced migrant workers and the sharecroppers are faultless (or their shortcomings are unsophisticated, understandable, or well-meaning). As a result, the novel reads in a few places like agitprop rather than fiction.Of course, that was Steinbeck's intent: he wanted to wake up the country. Yet, as a work of art, this style doesn't date well. Nevertheless, only a cynic or a monopolist could be unmoved by the story of the Joad family. It is truly a classic proletarian novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"When I was first assigned to read John Steinbeck's book The Grapes of Wrath in English class, the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. Over 600 pages! I was afraid it would be a story that wandered all over the place and didn't really have a point. Even after I had begun reading, it seemed that this assumption was correct since all book seemed to be doing was telling a very detailed and slow-moving story about a family in Oklahoma. However, as I continued reading, I began to realize that the very way the book portrays the life of these people so realistically and what the reader learns from their situation is itself the point of the book. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, an Oklahoma family of tenant farmers during the Great Depression who are kicked out of their homes because they cannot make a profit on their crops. As more and more farmers are kicked off their land to be replaced by men on tractors, over 300,000 people migrate west to California in hopes of earning a living picking fruit, cotton, etc... for owners with larger farms. Hardship follows them during the long trip to California. Even once they get there, they're divided against themselves as they compete for work so they can just feed their families. Throughout the book the family encounters opposition from all sorts of people, including land owning farmers who must pay extremely low wages in order to make a profit, cops who cause more trouble than good, locals who are afraid of the massive influx of people, and a government that seems unable to help. In the end it's sheer will that gives them the strength to continue to fight as the Depression relentlessly tries to break the people's determination and the family bonds. The Grapes of Wrath gives a very realistic view of the Great Depression and tells it from viewpoints you don't see from just reading about it in a history textbook. The book is divided into narrative chapters that tell the story of the Joads, and, every other chapter, the inter chapters that give information about the situation in a style that's part documentary, part editorial. Throughout the book, especially during the inter chapters, Steinbeck uses symbolism to convey ideas. In particular, there are many allusions to the Bible, including the title. Due to its realistic portrayal of the life of the migrants, the book has also come under considerable controversy for its profanity and sex, since those things were parts of the lives of these people. Also, Steinbeck uses the inter chapters both to make people aware of the problems and to give suggestions for how to deal with them, and many of his beliefs could be seen as Communistic. I have really found The Grapes of Wrath to be a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, it's a slow-moving book that contains a whole lot of talk that people who aren't really into reading books for fun will likely find boring, and it's just too long to hold some people's interest. On the other hand, however, the character interaction is very realistic and human, being based on actual migrants Steinbeck knew. Because of this, we get to feel like we really know the people in the book. The seemingly excessive length of the book is actually needed to give us a real understanding of how these people lived their lives. When the characters get into intense situations that threaten the physical and psychological well-being of the family both as a group of individuals and as a single unit, the book reaches hights of drama and emotional intensity that is almost never matched today in movies, books, video games, music, or any of our other forms of art. I often found myself just sitting there thinking about what I'd just read for a while after I finished with the required reading for the day. There's not really space within this 1,000 word limit to fully discuss my thoughts on this book, but what I can say is that it will draw you into the world of the migrants in the 1930's and show you plainly and truthfully just what it was like. I can understand the opinion of people who hate this book because it's all a matter of taste, and some people just would not be able to forgive the many parts they consider agonizingly boring. Although I give this book four stars overall, there are parts of it that I'd give 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The first thing that came to mind when I read Steinbeck's classic The Grapes of Wrath was its parallel to Upton Sinclair's The Jungle - the downward spiral of a migrant family who find themselves in a struggle to subsist in abject poverty. (Fortunately, where Sinclair rams Socialism down our throats in The Jungle, Steinbeck merely offers us a spoonful here.)Steinbeck provides wonderful development for each character in this story; though none of them could be called bright, each figure possesses a unique depth and personality. Tom Joad is the angst-ridden main character who has just been released from serving a long prison sentence. Ma is the family matriarch who provides strength and optimism even in the worst times. Jim Clancy is the fallen preacher who joins the Joad's on their sojourn. (Clancy is certainly the novel's most over-analyzed character - he has been likened to a metaphor for Jesus Christ, but I just didn't see it.)This now classic tale takes place during 1930's, and is about a family of Oklahoma Dustbowl farmers who, like countless others, migrate to California after losing their farm. But they don't give up without a fight, leaving only when the bulldozers come to raze their home. Packing up all of their possessions in the family jalopy, they make their way across a Depression Era America that has little pity on &quot;ignorant Okies&quot;. Along the way they meet other Okies fleeing back home from California after finding only starvation in the so-called promised land. (One of the most heart wrenching figures in the novel is the Okie who is returning after helplessly watching his child die of starvation). But, just like the Rudkis family in The Jungle, the Joad's are sure that, with some hard work, things will be different for them. Though the family does find work picking fruit, it is not the Garden of Eden they'd hoped it would be. Even the children must endure twelve hour days of backbreaking work in the hot sun under the cruel eye of their supervisors at their slave-labor-like work camps. They are forced to live in infested wooden shacks called &quot;company housing&quot;, and to buy their food at the &quot;company store&quot; whose prices are exorbitant and which comes out of their already paltry pay. The most horrifically ironic part is that while their meals usually consist of gruel &quot;with bacon grease for strength&quot;, they dare not eat the fruit they pick for fear of swift and severe punishment. Forced to flee the camp after Tom assaults a would-be rapist, the family is all but lost. The final scene is heart wrenching and unforgettable - and proves Ma's claim that the poor are the ones who can be counted when somebody is in need.The Grapes of Wrath is considered one of this century's greatest literary masterpieces, and with good reason. Its many layers are deeply thought-provoking - and provides insightful social commentary which could address many issues we deal with even today. Read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Over the years I've read and heard from many people about The Grapes of Wrath. The comments ranged from, \\"it's overrated\\" to \\"it's the best book ever written by an American author\\". I will not try to make you believe either. However, this is the most powerful writing that I have ever read. There are passages in this book that just make you stop and sit back to think a bit. One that hit me very hard was midway through the book: \\"Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor\\". This line was written in response to the destitute tenant farmers scrabbling for work with nearly no money putting a few coins each on a pile in front of a tent where a little boy had died of malnutrition so that the family could have him buried.Throughout history the American dream has had many speed bumps or as in the case of this novel, barriers. But the spirit of the American people in every instance has overcome all. This is a book about that spirit, nearly broken, but not ever completely. There isn't much that can befall a family that the Joad family did not have to deal with. It's a story of persistence and overcoming all odds without losing your own humanity. When everything is against you and you can still look at the other person as someone in more need, then you will begin to understand what made these people.Seventy years later, this story has as much or more relevance than the period from which it came. The world is absorbing yet another economic crisis. There are many differences between now and the era of the Dust Bowl and Steinbeck brings these to the foreground with his typical prescience.The family unit is front and center in this work. The mother and father were so over matched by the elements of nature, progress and technology and just plain happenstance that every member of the family stepped in and picked up the entire group on their shoulders when it was needed. Looking back at this particular element of the story by way of 2011 makes me think that as a culture, we have lost some of this most fundamental building block of society.As liberal and progressive a thinker as John Steinbeck was in presenting this story, I cannot help but think just how conservative his thinking by today's standards. His use of ostracizing the children at croquet and then using a similar method on adults at the government camp would be thought to be draconian today, but in fact these were commonly used forms of punishment to protect the whole of society from those that wanted to break it down. Are we missing this element in today's society?In The Grapes of Wrath, several years of dust storms and drought have brought on major changes in the way farms and farmland are owed and operated. The big, bad corporations and banks take over the land when the tenant farmers are not able to make their payments. Is today's economic crash much different? Are we substituting housing for farms? How many of those subsequent bankers lost their jobs to a different but very real economic stress in 2008 as many large banks had to downsize and re-organize?The relevance is real, the emotion palpable, and the understanding that it could happen to anyone is scary. Yes, The Grapes of Wrath is as terrific as it is terrifying, real as it is relevant, and is as American as Apple Pie. If you haven't read it before, please do so. Instead of ridiculous demands in our schools to read Great Expectations, The Grapes of Wrath should be the book of choice. There is just so much to be learned from this great book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"When I first moved to Los Angeles, the majority population was White with fairly large Hispanic and Black minorities. Now the majority population is Hispanic, and I frequently find myself communicating with them in Spanish.Look in any newspaper. All around the world, large masses of people are on the move: Albanians to Italy, Serbs to Hungary, Rwandans to Zaire, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to Britain, Algerians to France, and so on. Every year, the number of people in refugee camps grows; and the resources of nations are stretched to the limit to accommodate the influx.In America, we've had our own migrations: from the original 13 Colonies to the West, Blacks from the South to Northern industrial cities after World War II, and the Okies to California during the Depression.My point is that Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH discusses a very contemporary phenomenon with compassion and great artistry. His Joad family can just as easily be Mexican \\"Wetbacks\\" looking or a better life in the same places where the Joads went (Arvin, the site of the FSA's Weedpatch Camp, is mostly Chicano today). How Steinbeck, a native Californian, came to side with the Okies against the corporate farmers and their hired deputies, and the townsfolk who supported them, is an interesting story in itself. Suffice it to say that no one was more sympathetic with the plight of the poor than Steinbeck, who at times comes across as an American Gorky.There are other books that show equally great compassion. Steinbeck in this novel, however, rises to heights of poetry he was never to reach again. Tom Joad in this passage explains why he decided to become a labor organizer:\\"Says one time he [Jim Casy, the preacher] went out into the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul. Says a wilderness ain't no good , 'cause his little piece of a soul wasn't no good 'less it was with the rest, an' was whole. Funny how I remember. Didn' think I was even listenin'. But I know now a fella ain't no good alone.\\"There are scenes, such as the description of the progress of a turtle seen by Tom as he walks down the long road home after being paroled, where you see as if in a magnifying glass the progress of untold thousands of farmers fleeing the drought of the Dust Bowl.This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man. It takes the side of the hated, misunderstood outsider and sees poetry, goodness, a rough justice, and a tenacity that can move mountains."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"If you are looking for slick plots, witty humour, or fast paced action, don't bother looking here. Steinbeck trancends society's 2 minute attention span to deliver a work so thought provoking, so fundamentally touching and heart-wrenching, that the reader cannot help but ponder its effect long after having put it down.The novel follows the dust bowl migration of the Great Depression, alternating between the desolate struggle of a migrant family - the Joads - and more broad depictions of a people forced to the threshold of human tolerance and survival.The language is especially brilliant. As one less than ecstatic reviewer exclaimed,\\"this book was about dirt, poor people and dirt.\\" Exactly, and one could not craft a more beautiful picture out of such material. The imagery is wonderfully crafted to perpetuate exactly what Steinbeck wanted: gloom, anger, and a paradoxical will to keep faith and move on.\\"Our people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor. Pray God some day a kid can eat. And assosiations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop. And there's the end.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It wasn't that this had some exciting story that kept the reader glued to the pages. No shocking climax (although there are a number of shocking events portrayed throughout), no personified villian... none of that.The Grapes of Wrath is phenomenal not for the unforgetable cross-country trek of the Joad family in the post-depression years, but for the essence of humanity which Steinbeck so perfectly captures in every chapter. Steinbeck demonstrates how people who are just barely getting by on what they have sometimes have more to give to their fellow man than the wealthiest citizens our society has to offer. He draws a vivid picture of struggle during hard times for the most disenfanchized Americans, yet shows the emotional side of poverty and disolutionment, and reveals how genuin humanity can often be most prevalent amidst the most inhumane of living conditions.It has been said that Steinbeck had a socialist agenda when he came out with The Grapes of Wrath, but I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Steinbeck isn't so much jabbing at a political/economic injustice in this novel as he is striking at the lack of humanity that can be brought about when business efficiency and profitability are thought to trump human decency.As I write this review the American financial system is once again in peril, and themes from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are suddenly becoming more meaningful than they had been when I read this book in high school. I am amazed at how true and applicable Steinbecks points still ring today, and I recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it in years or who has yet to read it for the first time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is incredibly boring. This review is coming from a teens point-of-view. It is based in the 1930's during the Great Depression. The story flips from the Joads-a family that is moving from Oklahoma in search of work in California-to little social commentary chapters that discuss the whole situation in general. I found this to be sort of like a modern day bible for it has the Joads made up of 12 people like the 12 deciples who are being pushed out of their homes like the jews. There is a character who plays the Jesus Christ role, another who symbolizes Judas, and an unborn baby who represents Moses. Don't get me wrong this book definately makes you think, but i found my self getting annoyed with this family because of their ignorance. I don't want to reveal to much in case you want to read it but personally i advise you to give spark notes a visit. This book is also very slow so if you have a short attention span then i suggest not reading it. If you enjoy Steinbeck novels then go for it, otherwise, just buy the cliff notes.

Unless you're a high school teacher who is hell-bent on warping young minds into America-haters, this book is not worth the time, money, or energy to read. Did Steinbeck think that a sleezy political opportunist like himself (remember, he was a big proponent of the Vietnam War when it was being run by Democrats) can actually produce work of quality? Come ON.Think about the values of this book--irresponsibility is rewarded (who asked the idiot Okie farmers to borrow from the banks in the first place?), immorality is scoffed at, at the same time religion is put down (&quot;I was 14, randy as a billy goat&quot;), and capitalism gets the blame for an economic system that was anything but capitalistic (why else have oranges and potatoes thrown into rivers other than to prop up prices pursuant to a command economic policy?). Gradually this book i! s coming to be seen as nothing more than a product of the proto-&quot;Hate American First&quot; crowd, which is why it will continue to be popular among high school teachers."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Steinbeck will use a thousand words to paint a picture. He goes overboard with the detail, making it boring by modern standards, encouraging the reader to skip over entire paragraphs. It does, however, paint a very detailed picture of what life must have been like during the depression. His research was quite good. I can just see him wandering around Oklahoma and California with notebook in hand, jotting down endless details to give the book a realistic flavor. One time he used two full pages, and entire Chapter in this case, to describe a turtle crossing the road! The result is an often dull, but educational experience, if that's what you read it for. Most people buy novels for the suspense, because they are page turners. That's modern fiction, geared to readers that spend too much time watching car chases on TV. This book, however, is literary.One big problem I have with this book is the profanity. Over and over, several times a page at times, Steinbeck take's the Lord's name in vain. I read Christian fiction most of the time so that was a real turnoff. Still, I gave it three stars because it was educational and it gave me a deep appreciation for the blessings God has given me, compared to the plight of the Joad family and so many like them. Maybe if they didn't take God's name in vain so much they would have had an easier time!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Simply put: I didn't like this book.

Some of you who enjoyed this book seem to have noticed that. Well, I'm going to start this review off more than eloquently.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an utterly pointless, sneering exercise in self-importance. It seems as though Steinbeck wrote this thinking, \\"This is the single greatest piece of literature ever created by man, and I am the most amazing human being to ever put pen to paper! All will bow to me!\\" I'm so sorry to point out how wrong you are, Mr. Steinbeck.This is a story about the Joads. Fair enough. The Joads go to California in search of work because the big bad capitalists blew their house down. Fair enough. There's a great deal of not-so-subtle Christ imagery with Reverend Casy. Not entirely necessary, but fair enough. The point to all of this is, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" isn't so much a novel as a published mishmash of themes.The book has no plot at all. It simply follows this family as they migrate across the country while Steinbeck tells us how fantastic Communism is, and we should all do it. The author stands high on his pedestal and preaches to his readers, while failing to actually tell an engaging story.The characterization in the book is horrid. For some reason, critics find it a fabulous idea for Steinbeck to have created a group of one dimensional characters. I don't know where they studied, but to me, that's bad writing. Most of these cookie-cutter characters are hardly paid any mind during the book, and a good deal of them depart from the family by some means. The handful of characters Steinbeck does choose to focus on are in desperate need of deeper personalities. As it stands, I found it very difficult to actually care about what happened to any of them, and so I lost interest. This loss of interest makes it very difficult to read this book, because the reader must trudge through, at a snail's pace, hundreds of pages about characters he could care less about.I have a thought that the term \\"anti-climactic\\" was somehow spawned by this book. As if to prove to us that the novel does, indeed, go absolutely nowhere plotwise, Steinbeck ends the novel with Rose of Sharon offering her breastmilk to a starving full grown man. Oooh, racy, John Steinbeck, you must be a good author now! ...Well, no. After devoting several hours of my life to this monster of a book, I expected to fell a trifle more satisfied by the conclusion. Hell, \\"rah-rah communism\\" is a better ending than what is currently there.So, I really can't find a reason to like this book, and a lot of that stems from the fact that I can't bring myself to like or respect Steinbeck. Get off your high horse, already. Most people have stopped caring."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read this book for a report and found it really dull.

However, as I read more and more, I grew tired of fate's relentless assault on the Joad family.The book contains oodles of sex imagery, to the point I worry about Steinbeck's sanity while he wrote the book. An example of imagery run wild is given in chapter 5, where tractors and farm equipment are described as &quot;raping the ground methodically&quot; and many other sexual references. It's a TRACTOR for God's sake!!!! Continually Steinbeck dwells on sex whenever he can draw a metaphor.Another problem I have with the book is the constant bad luck of the Joad family. Murphy's law is proved countless times as every possiblility of good fortune is systematically destroyed. I believe if the book were three chapters longer, there would be no surviving Joads to write about.In short, while I agree the plot is rather solid, the book is a depressing saga of a family's misfortune in a time when countless other families were experiencing hardships. I recognize the historical importance and the statement this novel makes, but if I had had the choice I would not have read this book. It took me a week to get over the depression and disgust of the human race that The Grapes Of Wrath instilled in me."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The historical part of this book is very disturbing. Things like the bulldozer going across the open plains plowing everything under was very difficult to understand from the point of view of the individual families, but from the banks view it was the only way to turn a profit or break even in the hard financial times of the Great Depression. The author also puts in the small things that add a sense of verisimilitude to the story, examples like the prices of the fruit and cotton, and the wages the pickers got for their work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I thought that the most significant thing in this book was when Tom was telling his mother about what Casy had said to him.

Having it be a &quot;required&quot; read was also not encouraging. However, about 100 pages into the story, I became captivated by the Joad family---particularly Tom, a man of great moral integrity, and the strong-willed but loving Ma Joad who provides the family's source of strength and courage in the face of overwhelming adversity. While some parts may make you flinch in horror, others will make you sad to realize these events really happened in the land of plenty.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is an engrossing tale of one Oklahoma family seeking not their fame and fortune, but just the hope of putting a few scraps of food on the table. Join them in their clunker of a truck as all 12 of them pile in to make the long and arduous drive west to California in the hopes of finding work picking fruit. They lose family members along the way, some by death and some by choice, but they learn a lot about friendship and taking care of not only their loved ones but also the strangers who find themselves in the same dire straits as the Joads are in. Steinbeck's descriptions of the hunger, the hardship, the futile search for work, the disappointments, the hostile environment the migrants faced in California, all make for an eye-opening read. This is a great source of information on how it was for one group of people during the Depression.It may not be one of the great novels of the twentieth century, its characters are often overly-sentimental, and its theme is relatively simple, but it is a landmark of literature for the way it portrays the Depression in the western United States. This book has been proven to be an accurate portrayal of the victims of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.Steinbeck alternates plot-driven chapters that feature the story of the Joads with chapters that focus on the large-scale problems of the economic history of California and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners. These large-scale chapters provide background information and a broad world view that gives weight to the Joads' struggle, while the story of the Joads gives the large-scale chapters a sympathetic human face.Whether you love or hate the book, you will probably never forget this story of one family's valiant fight to survive while the world around them collapses and disintegrates.The novel was made into an excellent film in 1940 which starred a very young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Hello!I'm Betti from hungary, I need for a help.

This book definetley has an interesting background plot, and the writing style is very good, but like another reviewer commented, it seems half-finished. Almost like Steinbeck got the idea in his head and then half-way through developed writer's block.

Yikes!I'm never going to read Grapes of Wrath again, and won't be recommending it to anyone.If you don't like profanity, be careful."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a tremendous story, set in the depression of the 1930's. Whilst a great book, it is not an easy read by any means. The dialogue of the characters is embedded in local accented English, where words are shortened and abbreviated with apostrophes.The Joad family's struggles as they are cast out from their home and search for a better future in California is heartbreaking, as they are just a small, insignificant dot amongst the hundreds of thousands of other souls trying to do the same thing. Be prepared to suffer with them, as you are drawn inexorably into their world.If I have one complaint about the book, is that it is never fully resolved. Then again, it never can be, as to do so would take many books. So, as a result, the book concludes at the end of an episode in their lives, so it is left, in my opinion, incomplete."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I recently finished this book in an attempt to fill in the gaps of my \\"classics\\" of literature. A lot of people read this book in High School or early in College, but for some reason my HS skipped it, probably because it is a little longer than most of the other books we read. That said, I'm very glad I took the time to read it, and also find a certain amount of serendipity in the fact that I read it as the effects of the 2008 financial meltdown are still reeking havoc on careers of so many people. The book in of its self is great, but the timing of when I read seems to give it a little extra kick.Grapes of Wrath is often labeled as a work of socialist fiction. Personally, I didn't really get that from my reading of it. There are workers that are treated unfairly, they are often harassed or oppressed by their employers, they theorize that if they stand together they could demand more, and they find that they are often better off when they are left to fend for themselves. If you look at these, you will find that there isn't much in the way of propaganda here. Workplace bullying by those with any level of authority is a fairly well-known and well accounted fact of life. Your boss is a jerk and the company will do anything it can to suck every bit of effort out of you for the lowest price possible; maybe this was not well known in the 30's or people were more ashamed of it then, but now it is what it is. Which leads to the next point about workers sticking together. I don't think it is particularly socialist to realize the practical fact that there is strength in numbers, which can be leveraged against businesses that go to far. I know what Marxism is, and that isn't it. Finally, the characters often remark that they are better off taking care of themselves or enforcing their own laws. That sounds like a small government libertarian's dream to me.The pleasant surprises I found in the book involved the well developed characters, accept for Noah (pointless), Connie (plot point but nearly pointless) and Uncle John (broken record.) I was able to create a solid visual image of this tight knit family that shared so much together. You had a real sense of each person's place in the Joad family, that could be alternately openly loving or mechanically efficient. I also found Steinbeck's use of different literary tools interesting, with him moving (although not very smoothly) from immersive local color, to disjointed stream-of-conscious, to poetic prose. He uses these tools to help bring more texture to the parts they are used in without being too heavy handed, although his jumping from different perspectives or suddenly going head first in the mile a minute mind of a used car salesman, can be jarring.Some readers complained that this book is slow. That is true; it is a little slow, but I believe it is probably supposed to be. This isn't an action packed thriller or romantic drama, its a yarn about simple people trying to live their lives in a world that is far from simple. If the story didn't take the time to set up the atmosphere, to really set the scene, I don't think the book would be half as good.Finally, given the ago of book, there has been a lot of time for people to over analyze its historical accuracy. This is a work of fiction set against a series of events that happened in history; so looking further than that is merely an academic exercise. Its in the Literature section of the book store not the History or Non-Fiction section, so you would have to be a fool to put too much stock in the writer's interpretation of events.Pros:1.) Steinbeck does a wonderful job of capturing the mindset of a farming family. He waxes poetic about the cultivation of land in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible, which in turn gave me a real sense of how much love farmers can have for their life's work.2.) The fictional Joad family lets a 21st Century urbanite like me look into a world that I have little connection to and no experience with. A good writer engages the reader in a way that makes them feel like they are sharing the story with the characters, and Steinbeck does exactly that. I really wanted to know what happens to the characters after the all too open end (see con below.)3.) Some may disagree with Steinbeck's personal reasoning behind writing Grapes of Wrath, but it's hard to argue with his economics, especially since we are seeing a model of it in action now. As the demands for jobs go up, workers are willing to work for increasingly less out of fear and desperation. Just as Steinbeck's farm owners pit workers against each other to lower wages and work conditions, so do the managers and presidents of business today. Don't want to work overtime? There is a line of applicants that will. Want $50k a year? I have 10 resumes from people that will do it for $40k a year. You've got a retirement plan and pension? I should get rid of you because you cost too much and hire a college grad for the half the money and don't have to offer them any kind of benefits because they will be happy just to be working. This is real and I see it happening every day.Cons:1.) Like most good books, Grapes of Wrath isn't for the casual reader. It's long, slow and thoroughly depressing; as well has needing a little bit of historical context. I think it was worth it, but I know not everyone will get a lot out of it.2.) If I was looking to edit the book down to make it easier to read, I would tie up some of the dead ends or eliminate them altogether. What was the point of Noah? Do so many animals need to get hit by cars? Why did Casey play such an important role, just to vanish for a quarter of the book and then meet an inauspicious end suddenly.3.) The book ends very abruptly. There is a complete lack of finality that makes you wonder if the author really knew what was going to happen to his characters when he started writing. To just end the story in the middle of a sort of hairy moment, after suffering so much with the Joads, it almost seems like a waste. Steinbeck closed on a pretty, albeit odd in a modern context, visual, but I think it was a very unsatisfying ending.Conclusion:A great book about the American experience for some in the 1930's that is a little long, but for me should have been a little longer if only to give the reader a sense of what the future would have in store for the Joads."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Seeking a masterful work for our \\"One Book, One Community Reading\\" project, and deeming the economy the significant issue of the day, we selected John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath for our focal read. Steinbeck's novel, which depicts the plight of migrants during the Dust Bowl era, elucidates topics as current as this morning's newspaper-- bank foreclosures, hunger, poverty, immigration, collective voice. Steinbeck's book earned a Pulitzer Prize when it was written. It remains the most shocking book I\\"ve ever read. Read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I'm fifty years old, I've read literally thousands of books, and I'm not aware that I've ever read a novel written by John Steinbeck. Recognizing this deficiency, I ordered a Steinbeck collection, seven of his most celebrated works including The Grapes of Wrath. I vaguely recall seeing the film starring Henry Fonda, and am well aware of the plot and the historical backdrop, but nothing can take the place of reading the work itself.As most know, the book details the westward migration of the Joad family, as they are uprooted from their Oklahoma homestead by the evils of the Great Depression, the Oklahoma dust bowl and the advent of mechanized farming. The family harbors visions of milk and honey awaiting their arrival in California, or so they are assured by the numerous handbills promising plentiful work and bountiful riches. What await them instead are rapacious labor recruiters, unfriendly natives and slow but sure starvation.Steinbeck certainly succeeds in painting a vivid and stark picture of the hopelessness faced by the migrants. His chapters alternate between \\"big picture\\" overviews and the particular heartbreaks and hazards faced by the Joads in particular. The story is an education in economics, labor relations, politics and human nature. In this day and age, it is difficult to conceive of children literally starving to death in the shadow of the most productive agricultural land in the country, much of it lying fallow and off limits to those that were capable of growing the food to nourish their own families.This is a very powerful novel, both with regard to the emotions that it taps and the beliefs and conceptions that one holds. It provides a sharp contrast between a period when so many were desperate to work for as little as something to eat, to one in which so many demand so much without having to lift a finger. There must be a happy medium."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This was a great book, I enjoyed reading this very much, and believe that every high school student should read this for their history class.

The Grapes of Wrath by Steinback depicts the life of Joad family as a microcosm of the immigrant workers during the Depression era, and Steinback ingeniously describes the workers' plights and ensuing 'wraths'. The novel was so impressive toward the end; Steinback imbues great metaphors such as the baby, rising rain, vineyard, and so forth, and he powerfully portrays the scenes, especially the final one. I, as a student fond of reading, have to say that the novel was one of the few living novels that I have read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Beautifully written, but very depressing account of one family's struggle through the depression. Clearly shows both the bad decisions of farmers who lost their land during this time as well as the injustices thrust upon them as they traveled to California, the land of milk and honey, that turned out to be anything but. Steinbeck alternates chapters of atmospheric description with the tale of the Joad family who face death, starvation, police harassment and their own ignorance, struggling to stay alive with limited resources.

The sheer ease of reading alone should be enough to keep eyes fixed, let alone the sure-and-steady plot, textured characters, and every other chapter that emanates emotion, experience, plot, and thick smell of the times.I'd recommend this to anyone mature enough to enjoy something not written by James Patterson or Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book isn't for everyone. People I know who haven't liked it say that it was too slow, or \\"What's the deal with the turtle?\\" and didn't get past the first couple chapters. Some say it's just too sad.For me, this book meant everything. \\"To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth.\\" When I read this first line, I remember feeling like it was a line that I would always remember. I had the sense that I wasn't reading a story that some guy named Steinbeck came up with. I felt like the true feelings and experiences of a very real group of people were simply being funneled to me via Steinbeck's pen.The story felt very relevant to early 21st century America in that Fear seemed to be at the root of all evil. The Grapes of Wrath showed how Fear could be used to control and exploit people on a huge scale. It also depicted the human experience as profoundly intertwined with the earth. The characters' lives were turned upside down by nature, first by drought and later by flood. The very last scene showed how all of us are on this earth, in this life, together, like it or not and I found comfort in that.I had goosebumps and a pounding heart. All this for a book where the main characters speak in dialect about the \\"Fambly\\". Somehow John Steinbeck managed to fit what, to me, is essentially the meaning of life into a short novel about sharecroppers in the 30s.An amazing book.

Later, after I'd come to know his other works I went back for a re-read, thinking I'd been jaundiced by an HS English teacher presentation. I still didn't care for it.

I was saddened to realize that the crucial message so eloquently produced by John Steinbecks' fine pen, was lost on so-called &quot;AP&quot; students. (For starters, &quot;real&quot; AP students would have developed more profound literacy arguments than those stated.) I was first exposed to this jewel of literature as a freshman AP student in high school. As a senior in college now, the depth of this story only grows with each reading. Perhaps most disheartening in the disdain of these readers, is the ignorance to the storys' ending, the very crux of Steinbecks' message.Despite the grevious hardships endured at the hands of her fellow human beings and the stunning death of her infant, Rose of Sharon offers her breast to a dying man without hesitation. This clarifies Steinbecks' hope; not just for the dying man or the Joad family, but for humanity itself. A poignant symbol such as this is obviously lost on a few young reviewers, but valued by others. My suggestion for the young readers who so obviously do not understand or appreciate this moving piece of literature is to start out with something more at their pace; Hardy Boys perhaps?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck wrote some good novels, some that are even almost great (East of Eden comes to mind); this, however, is not one of them. The Grapes of Wrath is little more than bad communist propaganda.It isn't that the kinds of things he describes didn't happen, but the way he presents them---without looking for the deeper cause (rather than pulling out the tired old scarecrow of \\"greed\\", an abused and vague term anyway) or offering a real solution but rather simply pushing for a (dubious at best) political program---is not only unrealistic, it isn't artistic either. About the only time it approaches the level of genuine literary expression is when Casy goes on about how his idea of holy is for every man to be harnessed, not even to every other man, but to Mankind as a whole. That's a horrible thought, but at least it's a somewhat deeper one.Even Tom Joad's famous \\"Whenever you seen a cop beatin' a guy...\\" speech is all about the insignificance of the individual, and as if to prove his point, Steinbeck continues the story for quite a while after that but Tom (despite having been the main character up to that point) does not reappear.And stylistically, this is one of Steinbeck's worst...it could be described as faux-Hemingway---lots of awkward sentences, unnecessary repetitions of words rather than using pronouns, etc. But it actually reads more like Socialist realism than anything else. It has a lot in common with some stuff put out by the Union of Soviet Writers under Stalin around that time. East of Eden is much better written, though Steinbeck is still using some techniques he seems to have learned from writers like Kataev.I did a bit of research after finishing this, and it looks like Steinbeck actually joined and had further involvement with the League of American Writers, which was set up by the Communist Party USA in 1935 in sympathy with the Union of Soviet Writers putting its policy of controlling and censoring the output of authors into effect the year before. Anyway, enough was known here about what was going on under the Soviet system by the time he wrote The Grapes of Wrath that he couldn't have had any honest excuse for glorifying it like that.I suspect that the only reason The Grapes of Wrath is considered such a great classic is that it was heavily pushed by the press which was highly sympathetic to communism in this country at the time of its release, and because of the movie version with Henry Fonda. People like to pretend that Steinbeck wrote books like this for \\"the common man\\", but the truth is it's incredibly patronizing and condescending; he really wrote it for wealthy intellectuals like himself to feel better about themselves. As someone who's in the working class himself (but doesn't intend to stay there his whole life), I think if I ever met Steinbeck I would have slapped his face, because The Grapes of Wrath is basically a slap in mine."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I ordered this beautiful book, and received a blue hard cover from Reader's Digest.

I grew up in Oklahoma, so this story hits home. I couldn't really call myself an Okie without the knowledge of our history and just what that name means to those few souls who are still alive that remember the hard times and forced migration of many of our people.Mr. Steinbeck illustrated just what happened when large corporations came in and took over the farms of the \\"little man\\". My heart really identified with small time farmers being attached at the soul level with their land, something large corporations could never do.I wonder how things could be a rough and poor as the dust bowl days, I try to imagine the people of American enduring. We have really become very soft, with even the poor having such extras that couldn't have been imaginable by the migrant workers described by Steinbeck.Never before have I been graced with the prose that describes the haves and have-nots in such a dark and colorful way. The main characters, the Joad Family, learn what it means to be feared and hated by anyone who \\"had\\" something. The people of California that owned land or stores knew the face of desperation, because they had experience the lengths humankind will go to in order to feed their loved ones.Being a liberal and a supporter of labor unions I felt incredible compassion for the Joad family and all the workers just looking for a fair days wage, but I also saw how the establishment could put a sterile (it is not my fault) corporate face to the practices of the farmers who would exploit the plight of the migrant workers.Reading the book one probably find it hard to think this was done to our own people. Even though it is not right, it is easier to stomach such actions being levied upon outsiders who come and take our jobs, but can one imagine the same feelings towards truly desperate Americans willing to undercut each other to extreme measures just to put the very basic nutrients on the table for their families. We have moved several generations from the likes of this type of desperation, which would tear apart the fabric of the crowded, interconnected and interdependent nation that we live in now.Finally, I thought it was amazing how the police and union busters used tactics of counterinsurgency. I'm a military officer and found the subject very timely and see how well Steinbeck understood the strategies and how powerful the hearts and minds of the locals are to strategic success.The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending. The final few pages were a huge downer, but maybe that was the point. I couldn't grab onto any light or happiness to lift my spirits, but maybe that is just the point Mr. Steinbeck was looking for in the tale."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"If you want to get started by reading the sample, don't waste your time downloading it.

There aren't a lot of big words that require a dictionary either.. the only thing that is a little bit difficult is the way the author writes dialogue.

On his way to his former home he finds a turtle that he keeps as a pet present for his little brother Noah. The turtle may stand as a metaphor for the slow but secure progress of the narrative. Tome also meets a \\"reformed\\" preacher who likes to question the goodness of baptism, and a former neighbour, Muley Graves, who has decided to stay in the land in Oklahoma contrary to the general westward pull: \\"Place where folks live is them folks.\\"As he meets them, the Joads are getting ready to sell all their belongings and move to California. But how will their sense of identity be affected by the migration? The author seems worried about the conflict between the land and the machine. Something worse than the devil seems to have got hold of hte country and thousands of people are moving West, looking for something brighter than what they have got. Is it possible to relinquish your home and survive it whole? On their way to California they learn the value of sharing and helping one another after they meet the Wilsons. One thing is sure, and these mass migrations are the proof that men can still be moved by a concept, a palpitating notion, a dream (even if such dream is reduced to the image of a white house by an orange groove).One is to fear the day when man will refuse to move about, search, project. Even if this search is to lead to tragedy and loss. The will to live and to die and to survive for a concept makes of man a distinctive being in the universe: \\"Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action.\\" But can Paine and Jefferson exist alongside Marx and Lenin? From the point of view of the American dispossessed this seems dubious.Economic racism (\\"them Okies\\") and the ills of American capitalism work into the spirit and capacity of endurance of the worn-out families of migrant agricultural workers. These families have ironically held a belief on the myth of the American dream: a place can be found where an honest man can work steadily his way to respectability. Nevertheless the Joads only find their own progressive breaking-up in the motion. Theey learn of the prejudice and fear of the authorities and citizens of California, and of the untold speculative crimes of the big and medium farmers. The wrath of The Grapes of Wrath is the sign of hunger and frustration at the way things are made to work: unused land and crops laid to waste.The novel is a chant to family values and communal living, even if from the wrong side of the road. Tom Joad learns the importance of forming part of a larger group, even if he eventually gets separated from the people he loves because of his crimes. What is it that makes people survive under the most terrible conditions?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read maybe two books a year, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with this characters and details of a book as a result.

It tells the story of one family, the Joads, but shows the roughness and impact this time had on all people. The family leaves their farm in Oklahoma and travels to California to find work. Half of the characters die or desert the family by the end of the novel.I felt that the book was genius when it came to themes and exploring human characteristics, but the actual book length was much longer than needed to put the points across. Steinbeck has a wonderful ability of taking on a character and revealing common human weaknesses and the affects these personality traits can have on other people.The structure used in this book is unlike any I have ever seen. It reminds me of the ties on a railroad. One chapter will speak very broadly about the whole movement west, and then the next will discuss the Joad family's own problem concerning this matter. But really they are all connected to each other and continue in this repeating pattern. I feel that the most important theme in the book is mans inhumanity to man. Steinbeck wants to prove that almost all of the hardships that this certain family endures are a direct result of another person's action rather than the weather or some other inanimate object. He does do this extremely well and I highly commend him for this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is a Classic tale about the Joad Family who are on the road to California in search of a better life. The characters in this book are real and this story was based on fact as the farming fields of Oaklahoma turned into giant dustbowls. The Joad family encounter many obstacles on the their journey but their optimism reigns Supreme. This is a wonderful tale about the Resilience and Triumph Of The Human Spirit in the Face of Severe Adversity.According to his biographer John Steinbeck was once photographed with a Whiskey bottle on his workdesk which gave the impression that he was another alcoholic writer like Hemingway. The reality was and is that Mr. Steinbeck was a moderate social drinker whose only vice was cigarettes.This can be attested to in his journey across America in his most excellent book \\"Travels With Charley\\". It is also a great pleasure for me to discover a Literary Genius who do not use his writing ability as an excuse to indulge in excessive drinking , cavorting with prostitutes and ingesting illicit substances.Thankfully there are some writers who led a decent, honest and hardworking life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"By Nicole FasolaI thought The Grapes of Wrath was a very well adapted movie, from the original novel by John Steinbeck.The movie (and book) was about Tom Joad, a man (played by Henry Fonda), whose Oklahoma based family is forced to move out after the Great Depression. Their only chance to find work was to pack up and move to California where 800 workers were supposedly needed. They then go on a long journey to California to find out that workers weren't really as needed as they thought.One of the things that really differentiate the movie from the book was that a majority of time in the book was spent actually looking for work once the Joad's were in California. In the movie, it seemed like they were in the car the whole time. I think that one of the problems with adapting such a long book like The Grapes of Wrath into a movie is choosing what to include. The screenwriter's chose to go into more detail about how difficult it was to get to California, and all that they faced going there, instead of when they actually got to California and had to search for jobs.Some other things about the movie that were different from the book were how minor characters in the books didn't have as big of roles in the movie. For example, in the book, there was a couple called the Wilson's, that actually traveled with the Joad's for a while. There were not included in the movie at all. Some other characters that weren't included were minor characters who would go to work with the Joad's, or eat with them.I thought that the cast of The Grapes of Wrath was very good. I especially thought that \\"Ma Joad\\" was very much the same in the book and movie. She had the same toughness in both installments, and also had an emotional side. I thought the transition from book to movie for Tom Joad wasn't as good. In the book, he seems more like a tough, scary kind of guy, while in the movie, he seems more sensitive, and emotional. He didn't seem like he could have actually killed a guy.The last thing that they could've added into the movie would've been the last part of the book! The movie ends when Tom leaves the family and the family packs up and moves somewhere else. They never even got to the part where Rose of Sharon has her baby. That part of the book isn't essential for the story, but it does help conclude things nicely.Even though there are many thinks that I think they should have done differently, I still thought that it was very well made. It really showed how difficult it was to get to California, how the family was breaking apart, and how difficult it was finding work. The book and movie are both worth investing time in."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This last week I finished reading The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. If you have not found your way to this book yet, you need too. Spawning from the Great Depression era, this intriguing piece follows the downfall of the Joad family on their cross country trip to California. The age of industry and of the machine forces the Joad's off their farm, and having few options, they pile into their broken down truck towards California in hopes of big jobs and big dreams. The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful historical piece of fiction that is a must read for every American. It brings to life every American issue; the American Dream, family, capitalism, religion, and sexuality, as well as numerous others. I recommend reading this book in the Spring or Summer as it is very dark, but it has to be.

In every region people viewed outsiders as a major threat, and treated them as criminals.Steinbeck took one family and related their circumstances with many. The journey of pursuing a better future with everything at stake adds a sense of suspense to the overall theme of the novel.He was able to capture the despair of not being able to feed their children or to provide a stable household. The novel keeps the reader intrigued with what is going to happen next, a true classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This moving novel captures the heartbreak of people driven into poverty by events beyond their control. Author John Steinbeck (1902-1968) examines the hardships faced by \\"Okies,\\" displaced farmers of the 1930's who headed for California and tried to scrape by as migrant workers.The story centers on the Joads, a family of destitute Oklahoma farmers that head for California in hopes of finding work as fruit pickers. Death and misery accompany their journey, and things aren't much better once they arrive. The people (and law) in California fear and mistreat newcomers, and what little work is available invariably involves long hours and poverty-level wages. The only time the Joads get respect is when they lodge at a modest U.S. Government camp for transients - the author once toured such camps with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The book's ending is powerfully inconclusive, reflecting the sturdy will of people to endure hardship as the Great Depression drags on.This book captured the 1939 Pulitzer Prize. It was also turned into the classic 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda - a movie that was often filmed in secret due to lingering resentment against \\"Okies.\\" I gave the book just four stars because in places it lags a bit, but it remains a powerful statement for caring government and help for the dispossessed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"what more can i say about john steinbeck's classic novel about the dustbowl? not much that has already been said.this novel is detailed and extensive. to sum it up.it is the joad family,circa 1939 from oklahoma,forced to leavetheir ramshackle house,on the road,heading for california\\"there might be some work there\\",meet some mean people,meet some nice people,granpa and granma die along the way,hunger,some violence,and, a still birth child andat the very end...a type of \\"re-birth\\" or at least an idea that these folks will survive as they have thatinstinct in their blood. let us hope so.this book is for older teens and adults. much of the dialog is what i would call,\\"local color\\" or in other words,it is written the way these people speak. for those who have not read it,it is a great american novel,an americanstory(our story) about the american people of the lost and lonely dustbowl era. sit back and enjoy. i think mostreaders will never forget this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" written by John Steinbeck is one of the most telling stories written about the migration of people from Oklahoma and Arkansas during the Great Depression.

Its grim tone hits you hard in the face and it's no surprise that Steinbeck said of the book that \\"I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags\\". But once you can adapt to the bleak tone of the book (and the narrator) it becomes deeply compelling, to the point where you will want your car journey to work to last just that little bit longer so you can listen to that little bit more.Anyhow, to let you know what the audio version of the book is like, it is first rate. Many audio books pick readers who have little to no versatility in conveying their charactors and read the book as if reading the football results. John Chancer is different as he really conveys well the 12 charactors of the family, so much so that you could swear that you've actually met the family and heard their voices!One limitation of the package is that it is a box with 16 CD's in 16 in fiddly thin sleeves. The CD case has a tendency to fall on the floor and chuck its contents all over the car, which is highly annoying when you are endeavouring to concentrate.But, aside from that, the story is excellent and the narrator creates a rich cast of voices to fit the landscape of the book.Incidentally, anyone who's a fan of the comedian Bill Hicks may be interested to know that this book was said to be his favourite. Hicks loved the book so much that he even based his 'famous last words' on Tom Joad's final speech \\"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.\\"Although Tom Joad's final speech is actually different, the spirit is the same and it's easy to see why he picked that part as it is easily the most profound part of a deeply moving novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read this thing once every couple of years.

One can compare the trials of the Joads to those of Holocaust victims or Civil War participants. I am not saying their experiences are as horrible as those of the Jews and soldiers, but it is amazing that we (as a country at the time) could care so little for our own brothers. These people were not leeches before the Bank takes over the land. They made an honest living and worked very hard for it. Then they have to force themselves to rely on the kindness of strangers when they move West.

This book can be simply described as story of a tenant's family who struggles to maintain their lives, but there's more than that. What makes this story beautiful is the author's intention to tell the readers a message called love through the story of them. The love in the story isn't romantic, but it's love within families and neighbors. The family in center of the story is about to kick out from their land. They have a son who just came out of the prison. Also a pseudo priest had joined in the family. Their occupations and situation they're in are worthless, but their love to other members is enormous. Each family member shows love and faith to the others, and it ties them all as one. They dream to have stabilized life in California, but they end up losing every thing they had. Still love remains in their heart. The family shares their love to the strangers. They offer what they could give even though they end up in a situation of barely feeding themselves, which hardly can happen. The family thinks of others who are in worse situation than them first. In the story, the love they shows to the others is big enough to revive the society where obeys nothing but money, power, and egoism. After reading this book, you'll be able to think how big the love of your family is. You also might get a chance to think about egoism, whether you weren't selfish at all. Then you'll learn that love still remains in this world even though people are becoming more world lings. Probably that's what the author wanted to say.The author's message was love to the family and others, but he also intended to give deep emotion to the readers. Therefore, he had set the characters' situation as worth as it could be, and still showing love to their neighbors. This gave the story less reality. When people lose their house, car, and got nothing left to eat, they don't have extra time to think about the others. That's how people are like. The author might want to change basic thoughts of people being selfish, but it made the story unrealistic. If I were the author, I would end the story as happy ending, such as reunite of the family, so the family got what they have deserved for sharing their foods and love to the others. That's more realistic.The theme of the story is love. Love is the one that makes every life in the world work properly. It isn't money or power that people satisfy with, but it is love that makes people satisfy, through their hearts too. This book shows this fact well, and is recommended to read at least once. This book is recommended to teens and older who lived to be financially rich or be famous. Once those people read this, they may get a chance to look back the life they had lived. Also they'll learn being financially rich isn't the best life, and there is nothing happier than giving and receiving love from others."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is a major classic. The story flows and leads the reader into the depths of the Great Depression. Amazingly accurate and increasingly personal, the story about the Joads is very emotional.The book starts out with Tom Joad getting out from prison and expecting life to be as it was. But it isn't, instead his family is about to get kicked off the land by &quot;the monster bank owners in the east&quot;. As the story progresses, Steinbeck tells of their journey to California. The place where all their dreams will come true. But dreams aren't always reality. When the Joads finally reach California, their fantasies and visons are all shattered as they slowly realize and witness the evils of humanity.The ending is so profoundly emotional. After I finished the book, I sat there with the book in my lap, just thinking about the ending. So amazingly written. Touching and beautiful.

The Grapes of Wrath is a compelling story that reads very easily. Steinbeck uses great language and symbolism. I recommend reading the book and then looking at cliff/book notes.

I'm glad I did, though, as I loved the story. We hear all the time about the dirty 30's and all the hard times (like walking 3 miles to school uphill in a raging blizzard) but this really makes a person appreciate what these people must have gone through. The story tended to move slowly, but that let the reader get to know the Joad family well, especially young Tom Joad. They managed to make do with very little in the way of money or food and yet wouldn't hesitate to share what they had with someone else. It makes a person feel kind of ashamed to think we look into a full refrigerator and still think there's nothing to eat. I was hoping the story would end with a happy Joad family finding a home and work, but that was left up to the reader's imagination. I don't know if John Steinbeck just got tired of writing or what, but the ending left a little to be desired. I was sure they would meet up with their son again, but that probably wasn't a realistic look at how it most likely was then. The book will definitely make me think differently about migrant workers that come into our area. Things may not be quite as bad now as back then, but they probably face many of the same circumstances."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I bought this book on a whim, drawn by the attractive binding and it's reputation as a classic. My friends thought that I was crazy to read it on my own will, and, to tell the truth, I was somewhat hesistant myself to begin such a daunting book. Going in, I was expecting it to be boring.However, as I started to read I found that it was hard to stop. It's not that the story is compelling, but I truly loved the style of writing. Sure, the story is not fast, but from the start I felt as though I was a member of the central family, suffering in their misfortune and rejoicing in their joys. The abundant dialog allowed me to truly discover the character of everyone in the story.I admit that if I were forced to read this for classes, as well as having to contend with 4 other subjects, I would become frustrated at the slow pace.

Covering the migration of tens of thousands of tenant farmers from the mid-west to the West of America. The book is half-fiction and half historical narrative.Amazing and absorbing are two words that initially come to mind when recalling the story. We follow the Joads, a family of tenant farmers, from Oklahoma to California. The mid west has become a dust bowl and the crops are performing badly. The land owners are heavily indebted to the banks who call in their loans. The land owners have to bow as industrialization thunders down on them and tractors and massive earth moving machines plow and turn the land. The tenant farmers are evicted and slowly but surely, reality sets in. They have nothing but each other. All the work is out west they hear. Our story starts as they point the old jalopy west and set off for better days.Steinbeck writes the story from 3rd person perspective and writes using the vernacular one would hear if one were a fly on the wall. Only becomes On'y, something becomes sumptin, every becomes ever', family becomes fambly. After reading for a while, the voice in your head takes on a Southern drawl as you read over the exchanges of the family. Conversation is scant yet, succinct. Articulation is nonexistent but the emotion leaps from the page. It truly is amazing the amount of feeling Steinbeck manages to get across to the reader. You truly are in the wagon, tents, camps, fields with the Joads as their personal Odyssey develops.There are 30 chapters and every other one is a historical perspective that Steinbeck uses to color in the hurdles and forces working against the migrants who were headed West. These folks were treated with contempt, condescension, abuse, left to starve and physically abused by law-enforcement yet, they continued on their way with hope. The hope was eroding from within yet, onwards they went. Tight family units looking out for each other and helping others along the way.The characters all add their \\"something\\" to the story. One of the more interesting ones, for me, was the character Casey. Casey, an ex-preacher, is somewhat like the phone in the old movies. Someone would grab the phone and use it to fill in some parts of the movie. Casey has that role in some places. He's a thinker and we find him thinking and explaining things to the Joads as they come to terms with their predicament.This work is a classic, no two ways about it. It's an American Odyssey during the great depression. Down home, heart of the Nation people uprooted by progress and forced to adapt to a world that didn't want them. Excellent work.6 stars."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a student of History I had to read this book again.

This theme should be taught as a subject in American schools."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The great depression was an unrelenting harsh time in American history where many families starved to death just trying to provide for their families. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent book that depicts one families struggle during this time. John Steinbeck executed and wrote this story very well. He truly is an amazing author, descriptive and precise, capable of creating mood and atmosphere that makes you feel as though you are a member of the family throughout the entire story. Steinbeck is not only socially and politically observant of the times; he also adds depth to his story by depicting the conditions that the people lived in, and describing the desires of not just individuals, but the nation during the struggle of the great depression, after the dust bowl. The story is an epic tale of one Oklahoman family and their forced migration west. After having their farm and home foreclosed on by the bank, the Joads are forced to leave the only home they have ever known. With word that there is work out west they are forced to make their trek across the country to survive. Even though it happened almost eighty years ago, The Grapes of Wrath is reminiscent of what is happening now in politics. With such a large gap between the wealthy and the poor there is a sense that all people want is a fair chance in this book. I would recommend this The Grapes of Wrath to anyone who has interests in politics, history, or social sciences. John Steinbeck has a very good understanding of these and even makes a few suggestions on ideas that he thought were good and later came to be( Like rotating crops in farming, the formation of unions, and other regulations that were put into place after the great depression). John Steinbeck demanded that a full copy of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" be put in the first edition of his book. It contains the line \\"He is stomping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\\" Which Of course is where he got the title for his book; also it captures the essence of his writing. If you are looking for a good fictional read, that is informative about the way people lived during the great depression, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"An oldie but one of the best.

Give it to your children. (Tell them it's by some guy you've never heard of but think is really amazing.)Above all, forget that it's a classic.

I have read most of Steinbeck's work and I am most impressed by the vivid skills with which he colors reality. Steinbeck's books specialize in early 20th California. This is the centerpiece of that collection.It is true that this book can be both dry and depressing at times. In reality, life also fits that description. There is not always a happy ending. This is one of the great qualities of Steinbeck, he does not feel the need for a happy ending in his work. When the dustbowl era of the 1930's dried most of America's crops in the center of the country, many people were forced to move. California was the promised land for some. For the majority, life in California was a nightmare of discrimination and starving through poor working conditions. People suffered and died. Life was harsh, and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a perfectly painted picture of that reality.While the movie version of this book starring Henry Fonda is well done, certain things are omitted. The controversial ending of the book is too much for the silver screen. The story of Tom Joad and the rest of the Joad family is enjoyable read. The fighting spirit and sense of justice in the tragic hero Tom Joad is still very real in the world today. If only there were more Tom Joad's in the world."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, heart-wrenching story of a migrant family's struggle to find a better life in the \\"Promised Land.\\" It begins with Tom Joad getting out of jail on parole, and coming home to find that his family was moving west to get out of the Dust Bowl.Believing that California would be the land of opportunity, they left Oklahoma in search of a better life. The journey was difficult, and the difficulty they faced did not end as they entered California. Rather than finding themselves in the land of opportunity, they had to endure horrible living conditions and low wages.Throughout all of this, Tom Joad is running from the law because he violated his parole by leaving California. Although he has broken the law, he dedicates his life to doing good. The lives of the Joad family are filled with overwhelming disappointment and anguish, but there is a small spark of hope for the future and for humankind which transcends this sorrow.The story will captivate you, but to appreciate this masterpiece you must read his words, not only his ideas. The Grapes Of Wrath is not just a novel; it is a flawless piece of artwork filled with figurative language, brilliant characterization, illustrative description and euphonic, melodious words. The structure of the story is very interesting as well. There are interchapters, short stories giving some background about this time period, woven throughout the entire story, and they are reflected in the later chapters.This was the most interesting and most beautifully written story that I've read in a long time. Buy it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, I remember distinctly having to read in high school, and I hated it. Now, years later, I sat down and read it again, and had so much more of an appreciation for the book and the depth at which John Steinbeck was getting to in his portrayal of the Joads' trip to California in search of the American Dream.The story has both allegorical as well as literal elements to it. Set during the depression in the 1930s, it is the tale of the migrant farm workers from Oklahoma who leave the South for a chance at better job opportunities and life in the West. Specifically, we follow the path of the Joad family in their journey, and they use a rickety old truck that can barely fit the entire family to head westward. There are some from the community who refuse to go because of their principles, namely Grandpa Joad, who holds strongly to his belief that leaving Oklahoma is admitting defeat. Tom Joad, who recently got out of jail, and Jim Casy, a former preacher, join the family on their way west. Along the way, the Joads have several mishaps and disasters, and the family tries to stay together and maintain their hope that once they get there, everything will work out for the better.One of the more interesting characters in the novel is that of Jim Casy. He continually tells the family that he is no preacher when they want him to recite some type of prayer for them, yet, despite his protests, his role to the family and significance in the book is critical to their faith, as he represents a \\"moral\\" voice in the book. He is also responsible for the transformation of Tom Joad, the book's protagonist, who slowly begins to look at life from different viewpoints after meeting the preacher, and, by the end of the book, has changed his outlook.Among one of the great aspect of the novel is Steinbeck's descriptions of 1930s California. Some may think that this is tedious to read in a novel, as we have many chapters sole devoted to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written. In effect, it really paints a picture of what life was like for many who made the trip west, and their difficulties along the way.Not only is the novel a testament to the situation of the migrants in the 30s, but it depicts and indirectly criticizes man's inhumanity towards others in times of need. This is represented in the plight of the Joads, who represent a microcosm of a family in need during this time. These families get shuffled around from place to place, and try to keep their dignity and hopes up despite the lack of compassion from some of the landowners.I'd say that, if you have to read this in high school and don't like it, try it again a few years later down the line. There is also a movie version of this book, with Henry Fonda, from the 1940s, an excellent film that is quite faithful to the book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A required book is always a drag believe it or not, but the The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, was a different story from the beginning. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who travels to California during the Great Depression (1930's. During their trip to the great land of California the Joad family goes through sadness, happiness and obstacles all while migrating to California. Once they arrive to California they are faced with racism in their own country. The attention-grabbing novel had the Joad family face racism, while migrating from Oklahoma to California. They are referred to as \\"okies\\".The heartfelt story that may relate to many people also had a twist. While traveling to California the Tom Joad, one of the main characters is faced with his past and reflects on it while making the journey. He was faced with jail, and knows that he can't be seen doing anything wrong. Scared of being caught or thrown in jail once again he and his family move on even thought they had already found a pleasant place to settle.This book deals with issues such as discrimination. In the novel the Joad family is faced with discrimination. They are lied to when they try to get a job, they are called \\"okies\\" and they are evicted from the land they travel from. This novel isn't all negative. Steinbeck also shows how the migrating families help each other by creating communities over night and then moving on, and every night communities are set up, and everyone gets along, and no one is left in hunger.This novel may be required in High School, but it is also a great book to read on your free time. Enjoy this incredible book, while learning the struggle of families that migrated during that era and still migrate with the same hope and dream of having a better life for themselves and their loved ones. This book deserves four out of five stars.Eder Gaona"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Hearing this story again on tape was just wonderful.

This actor does a great job in rendering the characters with sensitivity.My favorite part is when they cross into CA and Mrs. Joad makes her stand, saying \\"We're not bustin' up this family!\\" This scene was just as moving on tape as it was when I first read it long ago.

Some were negative, but most were positive, so I went into reading the book with an open mind. John Steinbeck is a skillful writer, and takes great care in putting his point across.This novel was not just about the depression, and the families who moved west, it symbolized all of the groups in history who were looked down upon as less than human.Though the symbolism is way out of control in this book, it shows you how careful Steinbeck is at writing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is an excellent book; I'd highly recommend it. I've read other Steinbeck books such as East of Eden (not a favorite) and Of Mice and Men (liked it too). However, Grapes of Wrath is by far one of Steinbeck's best.

What a classic!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Set in the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, and on the long road to California, the promised land in the time of The Great Depression. The Joad family is one of many families, sharecropers, thrown off thier land when the crops fail and who must become migrant workers. There is the promise of jobs in California, so to California they must go. Piling thier trucks and cars high with what few possessions they have not sold, and heading out on the road.This is more than the story of a single family though, much more. This is the story of hundreds of thousands of families, homeless and wandering and starving while trying to maintain a shred of dignity and humanity. They must endure the cruelties of the road, the police, the foremen of the farms who will work entire families all day for only enough money for a single meal's worth of food at the company store.Though this book's length is rather daunting, I found myself so caught up in the struggle of the Joads that I read through in a short time. Through the story of the Joads, the story of the migrant workers of that era is well portraied; the struggle of many in the migration, the search for work, the pain of death, the dispair of watching the children go hungry and feeling helpless to stop it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Interpretation of great American literature usually requires some perspective...indeed one must have lived a large portion of life to fully appreciate it's hardships. This philosophy is never more evident than when considering John Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. At once a testament to human fortitude while also a study for the historian to obtain a more humanistic perspective on the Great Depression, Steinbeck achieves a sort of literary pantheon with this timeless classic.This is the story of the everyday mid-western crop farmer during the great &quot;dust-bowl&quot; tragedy of the Depression. Forced by economic and personal factors to disband their farms and land (leaving generations of family history behind), they head to California to start anew with the promise of economic stability. Alas, this notion is soon discovered to be false as life there becomes even more destitute than the one that they have just left. Steinbeck's fictitious Joad family most assuredly mirrors the many similar groups that actually made this treck across a suddenly barren mid-western United States. Hardships and sorrows accrue as their savings run out and the promise of work becomes an ever lengthening ideal. Steinbeck presents a tome that emphatically enforces this personal sorrow while maintaining a fast paced novel thats unique in literary circles. Historical accuracy is never compromised as Steinbeck keeps the State and Federal governments' skewed Depression Era's economic policies at the forefront of the story and shows how these mis-guided actions indirectly become the driver for Franklin Roosevelts &quot;New Deal&quot; policies.The overriding virtue of this work, however, is Steinbeck's ability to take the reader along and make him a part of the story. Time and again, I truly felt the compelling sadness and overwhelming desperation of the Joads plight and when this is coupled with the incredible &quot;readability&quot; of the story, one can see why this work has long been considered &quot;the great American novel&quot;. Having half-heartedly read this in high-school, I'd submit that it should be re-read by those who now have families and responsibilities...a new appreciation will most assuredly be gained and I give this my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Jane Austen and her times","review":"I wrote this review on this book that was not available as new at amazon, and now found this one, so I'm putting it here. I actually bought it on a bargain rack at Barnes and Noble, and absolutely loved it. The interesting thing is that it was written in early 1900s! So when G E Mitton refers to something that happened long ago, and sometimes she compares it to \\"modern\\" conveniences, those are no longer modern. She talks about how letters were dispatched then, and now with her \\"modern technology\\" there was the telegram. This was written before even WWI, so in comparing the wars of Jane Austen's day to modern wars, she mentions ones I have never heard of! But it gives a good, thorough description of the times back then, and when she talks about how beloved the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth are in her day and age, that still rings very true today!"},{"Title":"Master Go in Ten Days","review":"... beggars would ride. And if go could be mastered in ten days, everyone would be a master...Similarly, it's possible, but not likely, to \\"master go\\" (i.e., achieve a 1 dan amateur ranking -- the equivalent of a strong chess expert) in ten days, but only if that means spending twenty-four hours studying and mastering the material in each day's lesson. Master Go covers a lot of useful material, but don't expect to master it ten days . . . or ten weeks. And don't expect to be a master if you do. The publisher of this title says that the book is intended to help you along the path to reaching a low kyu level.The first lesson covers the basic rules, strategies and tactics of the game as well as the differences between the Japanese and Chinese scoring systems. I don't know why this lesson was included. It covers material found in introductory books, but the treatment here is too abbreviated for beginners and unnecessary for players who already know the rules. Beginners should start with the first two volumes of Janice Kim's Learn to Play Go series or Cho Chikun's Go: A Complete Introduction to the Game instead.The other nine lessons cover tactics for capturing stones, opening strategy, basic josekis, life and death, tesujis, attack and defense, the endgame, and annotated games. In general, the material I already understood was explained better in other books. The material I did not understand beforehand was still confusing after studying these lessons. I found the lessons most helpful in identifying gaps in my understanding. If you completely understand everything the author covers in a given lesson, then you probably have a pretty good grasp of the topic, and the lesson serves as a useful refresher. But if you don't understand the concepts presented, then you know you have some studying to do. Chances are, you'll need to look elsewhere or review the material with a stronger player in order to fill the gaps.The explanations are so terse that in some instances they are literally wrong. For example, the lesson on Life and Death classifies several life and death positions as alive, which are actually unsettled. The weaker side can live, but the other side can kill the group if it goes first. This seems to be a result of the author trying to cover too much material in too short a space.Mastering Go in Ten Days should help most mid kyu players identify the areas that most need improvement in their game. Where the book falls somewhat short is in explaining the concepts in sufficient detail to fill those gaps in understanding. For more accessible and more in depth explanations of the material touched upon here, I'd recommend Bozulich's Second Book of Go, Kageyama's Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go and the volumes in the Elementary Go Series."},{"Title":"Master Go in Ten Days","review":"i think that's about how long terry buck has been playing go. of course, he didn't have this book to help him.he really stinks!"},{"Title":"THE INFLUENCE OF GREEK IDEAS ON CHRISTIANITY.","review":"If you are studying how the Greek world affected Christianity and how, since the second century, they incorporated each other and formed the philosophy (from which the preasent day practice of Christianity emerged), then this is a good companion and study reference.

I daresay that Chadwick's work has plenty to do with a better understanding of the Catholic faith in the 19th and 20th Centuries.Regarding its content, the book's title is somehow humble. It includes far more than the history of Gregory XVI, Pius X, Leo XIII and Pius XI, it is a history of the Catholic Church in continental Europe in that period.Regarding its form, the book is a pleasure for any reader (I was delightfully surprised, for I knew his \\"Secularization of the European mind in the 19th Century\\", excellent too, but not at all engaging). I would point out, for instance, the ability of Chadwick,to vividly draw, with a stroke of his pen, plenty of characters, not only the popes (e.g., his description of Bismarck).Then, I do recommend this book to anyone (urbi et orbe!)."},{"Title":"A History of the Popes 1830-1914 (Oxford History of the Christian Church)","review":"Professor Chadwick continues his history of Christianity by relating the stories of the 19th century Popes and their largely unhappy coexistence with the forces of science, capitalism, liberalism, nationalism, and the like. Professor Chadwick's dislike of all the above gives him common ground with , for example, Pius IX.The structure of the book is straightforward and admirable. He begins in 1830 and goes to 1914, and stops. He makes few attempts to directly address any overarching themes. This is not to say that he shies away from generalizations. On the contrary, the book is awash with sweeping statements unsupported by notes. It reads like a very long example of the old Oxbridge weekly essay, and owes a good deal of its polish to the fact that it is not encumbered by the need to see the other side, or to balance one viewpoint with another.The result is sometimes troublesome. We know that Pius IX was not universally popular, but Chadwick is not one to tell us why: he leads us to believe that all who disagreed with the Pontiff were wicked and stupid. This could be an interesting and refreshing viewpoint if it were supported with facts. It is not. There were a number of factual errors in key places which made me uneasy.Chadwick, in his work on the Victorian Church, produced the definitive text on the subject. I had hoped that &quot;History of the Popes 1830-1914&quot; would be similarly authoritative. It is not that, not by a long ways. I did enjoy it, but I think it a book to be taken with a grain of salt, both for its failure to draw the larger picture, and for its surprising degree of bias."},{"Title":"The Killing of Ned Christie: Cherokee Outlaw","review":"The Bonnie Spear book, The Killing of Ned Christie, contains an extensive biography documenting her research for writing this book. However, some information in this book is not accurate. For example the information given regarding the Palone murder case lacks correct information from the case file in Fort Smith, Arkansas and at Northeastern State University, Tahlequah, Oklahoma. While the incorrect information from this source does not cloud the significance of the work, it is disappointing. A real and apparently honest attempt to research the Ned Christie story was attempted. The book reads easily and is comprehendable. Some names are found to be in error such as refering to Ned's paternal grandfather as Ned, his name was Lacy (in English)(He did have a great uncle named Ned Christie);this error is indicitive of several errors in family history information. Some names are in error and some individuals are left out of the story. The author also incorrectly identifies the name &quot;Christie&quot; as having been originally pronounced &quot;Wattie&quot; and writes it meant gourd. While, in fact, the original Christie name was &quot;Wakigu&quot; and doesn't translate to Christie but to Sugartree or StepAlong. The Christie name was take from a female family member prior to the 1839 Removals. It may also be noted Nancy Grease was not Ned's second wife. She was his fourth wife. Also on page 18 is a photograph identified as Ned Christie, when in fact this is a photograph of one of the marshals whom sought Ned's capture. It is also incorrect (on page 58) that the word Keetoowah means &quot;principle people&quot; or &quot;real people.&quot; On page 71 the author translates Ned's Cherokee name, Nede Wade, to mean Ned Christie. It translates roughly as Ned son of Watt. On page 83 in the footnote, Betsy Christie Wolf is a cousin of Ned's, not his sister (although, he had a sister named Betsy). There are a few other errors. While these errors do not effect the readability of the book, they are disappointing. Many people will not know the truth or take the time to research or document Ms. Speers work. I did enjoy reading the book, as I have all other books about Ned, fiction and nonfiction. Ned was my great-great uncle. I grew up and have lived my 40 years in Wauhillau. Wauhillau is where Ned was born and died. Many Christie descendant still live in the area, as do I.

Truly this is the most captivating book I have experienced amongst all of the numerous books on Mother Teresa. The author's articulate biography, along with powerful black &amp; white photography, seizing the endless moments of compassion and love that go on daily at the Missionaries of Charity, are literally God send. The book truly reminds ourselves how much love we are so much capable of giving to one another and to count our blessings, not our worries. I highly recommend anyone to buy this book because it is what any soul needs: a reminder to come back to where home is: love in God."},{"Title":"Faith and Compassion: The Life and Work of Mother Teresa","review":"Mother Teresa was one of the most remarkable people to have lived, and the only source of hope and happiness for those she and the Sisters of her order cared for. She lived in the 20th Century so her work is known, her actions are fact. She is not subject to the passing of centuries and the romanticizing, and embellishing, that time and lack of knowledge allows.She was an internationally powerful woman who lived among the poorest and powerless of people. She could summon help from heads of state with a phone call, lecture them on policies she believed were morally wrong when she was their guest, and then return to those no one else would help, touch, or even notice.While most talk about what should be done she did what she believed was her responsibility every moment of her life. She cared for those who needed care unconditionally, and it is this that causes me to place her above the others. There was no we and they, no us and their, for her there were only people who needed care.She was Catholic, I say so what. To categorize her with any confining label is to insult her and her life's work. She did not offer her care based upon religion, or a person's view of their God. She was criticized by The Roman Catholic Church for not converting those she helped, for not seeing that more of those that no one else cared about were baptized.The dandified occupants of The Vatican whose custom tailored frocks would feed hundreds of people were concerned with what was and is of no value, they still pompously howl at the moon that their religion is the only true way. While they were offering a jeweled ring to be kissed, The Mother was caring for a Leper, or for one who was dying, for she believed no one should die alone.One of my favorite stories...One of her buildings was near a shrine, and the Monks wanted her and her inconvenient destitute patients evicted. They wanted nothing to do with leprosy, death, and reality. They brought the appropriate Magistrate to tell The Mother she would have to move. They entered the building and located The Mother tending to a patient. There was a pause, and the Magistrate announced that when the Monks were prepared to do her work, he would ask her to leave. At the time of the visit The Mother was using tweezers to remove live maggots from the face of a person brought in off the street. The fact that no Monk stepped forward is no surprise; the fact that eventually more than one of those same Monks died in her care is the most perfect of ironies, and a great tribute to this woman. Health and well-being bring arrogance. When death approached they sought The Mother's care. There was no doubt she would provide it, she was free from hypocrisy.Mr. Navin Chawla has written eloquently about this wonder of a person before, and this time his words are complimented by the exceptional photography of Mr. Raghu Rai. There are many books about Mother Teresa, and even more that she wrote herself. If you buy only one, this volume gives you her words, the words of her biographer, and the pictures of a very talented photographer.This woman was more important than a given named faith, she did not give her life to the helping of Catholics, she helped anyone who needed her WITHOUT DISTINCTION. She did not qualify her love, classify those deserving of her time, or impose her beliefs on those that needed her.She represented and represents all that a human can be, and how absurd it is to label a given faith, or hold it above that of another. She transcended all religious boundaries, did so without distinction, and her actions were beyond any reproach.She was a woman of faith who offered the world a reason to still believe that hope actually meant something, and unconditional love exists. If History is any indication we will learn little from her, from this gift that was given to all. We will continue to divide into groups, argue about theological minutiae to which there are no absolute truths. And we will continue to slaughter using religion as justification, whether we are the killers or the victims.I hope I am wrong, I fear I am not."},{"Title":"Faith and Compassion: The Life and Work of Mother Teresa","review":"This book has made me realize that it IS possible to live a life of selfless service to God - even TODAY!

I think the reason is that That Hideous Strength is very different than the other two books. It took me a couple of chapters to realize that this book was not going where Perelandra and Out of the Silent Planet went, but when I realized that I could enjoy the book on its own merits. In fact, this is my favorite book in the trilogy. Although a Christian theme runs throughout the trilogy, when it is presented in That Hideous Strength it becomes more accessible. The evil in the book could and does happen. The basic good in the book is no less extraordinary (with certain exceptions). The adventures of Ransom on other planets in the first two books of the trilogy were to prepare him for the battle on Earth in That Hideous Strenth. An interesting phenomenon of this book for me was that when I was reading about Mark and the N.I.C. E. I longed for the story to switch to Jane and the group at St. Anne's. The people at N.I.C.E. were so disagreeable and petty and backstabbing that it made me realize what C. S. Lewis was saying about the nature of evil (or the devil). This book can be read for its story alone, but it is much more rewarding if you think about the ideas and beliefs present as well.Even if you are not religious or a christian the book can inspire you to think about what you believe in."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I only recently discovered the Trilogy, never having been much of a Lewis fan, and read them in order. Each book has its charms, but I especially enjoyed the way That Hideous Strength built on the &quot;circles&quot; of the Bad Guys, both at Bracton college and later at Belbury. Mark Studdock, a person possessing neither distinction, character, nor a talent for evil, has lived his life - and ruined it thereby - in a search for admission to 'the inner circle,' and any circle will do. He learns that each concentric circle, in addition to being more exclusive as he supposed, is also more evil and more banal.The characterization of Stoddock is superb. Likewise the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dimble and a few other minor characters. The book is almost worth reading just to gain the acquaintance of Mr. Bultitude.Others are far less engaging. MacPhee - one of the most unidimensional characters I have ever read - is a continual annoyance. The whole build-up with Merlin, only to have him turn out completely powerless until &quot;possessed&quot; by the eldils, makes no sense to me at all. And then he - what? Explodes? Couldn't anyone have done that? And why do God and the angels need an Arthurian wizard, anyway?But the biggest disappointment was Ransom himself. He went from being a lifelike, engaging fellow, in the first two books, to an idealized shadow. We never really learn how he goes from being a Cambridge don to a wealthy landowner and &quot;the Pendragon.&quot; Who are these people who bequeath St. Anne's to him on the condition that he take the name &quot;Fisher-King?&quot; How did he become the Pendragon? No explanation.This was hard to accept from such a brilliant writer. But that's not to say the book is unworthy of attention. I expect to read it again, probably soon, and will probably get more insights from it the second time through.I believe much of the problem the Trilogy has with readers of my generation is that it is always classed as Science Fiction, which it certainly is not. People read it expecting familiar formulas, and don't know how to react when it turns out to be religious allegory. They should read more carefully. As with most of what he wrote, Lewis intended to illuminate more than to entertain."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This book is fun to read, satisfying, thought-provoking--everything you'd want in a book. The storytelling is suspenseful, and you are so curious to know what happens next. What does happen next always feels believable, and logical, even though it is unexpected. To me, this book is the epitome of reading entertainment, while, as usual with a C.S. Lewis book, it delivers a deeper understanding of spiritual truths."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Oddly enough, the third book in the Space Trilogy has almost nothing to do with space. It also has very little to do with Ransom, the main character of the first two books.The plot centers around a young couple named Mark and Jane Studdock. Mark finds himself working for NICE, the sinister organization that gets its work done by not telling anybody (including most employees) what's really going on. Jane, meanwhile, ends up with the good guys thanks to a newfound ability of hers.For the most part, the book is very well-written (as one would expect from Lewis) and enjoyable. Most of the characters are complex and interesting, especially the Studdocks.The story's main problem is the ending. The bad guys are all finished off within the space of a few pages, and without anything resembling a struggle. After so much buildup, it leaves one feeling a little cheated. Also, the concluding chapter is strange and seems very out of place.All of the mythology can get tiresome at times, especially when the planetary eldils (the 'gods') are involved. It slows the book down considerably. An exception to this is Merlin himself, who is a very interesting character. Sadly, he doesn't show up until the end, and leaves right after he's done him job.The book also very strongly supports a \\"traditional\\" role for women in marriage, even going so far as having the good guys tell Jane that she shouldn't join them without Mark's permission. This idea is said to be the will of God himself, not just someone's opinion. This was offensive at times, but did not contribute to the four-star rating, since it's so subjective. A person who agrees with Lewis will probably find that it enhances the book.With these minor reservations, I recommend That Hideous Strength to anyone who likes fantasy, especially C.S. Lewis fans."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"C. S. Lewis' THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is nominally the third book in what is described as his \\"space trilogy,\\" but such a description does not accurately portray the nature of this prophetic work. Lewis himself calls it \\"a modern fairy-tale for grown-ups,\\" but that also falls short of adequate description. Since science fiction it is not, and a fairy tale it is not, let us see if we can determine what it may be.It is, of course, allegorical and suggests strongly the same sort of allegory that underlies the Ring series by Tolkien (despite the latter's statements to the contrary). As the scientific research organization N.I.C.E. steadily gains public acceptance, then public support, and then assumption of governmental authority, even as the nefarious nature of its goals becomes more and more evident, the reader struggles to scream a warning to the citizens being caught and enslaved in its encroaching web. Why do they not see through the faade of scientific progress and recognize the dehumanizing goals of this soulless entity? Why do they support this encroaching social cancer? Why do they turn against and attack those few who try to sound a warning? The reader, who has the advantage of an external vantage point, sees the growing evil, the destruction of that which is good, but is powerless to open the eyes of those who are being irretrievably deceived.Lewis' allegory is, unfortunately, timeless and is as applicable today as it was when it was first published in 1945. It is no stretch of the imagination to equate N.I.C.E. with the spreading multi-national corporations of the 21st century. As president of the United States from 1953 to 1961, Dwight Eisenhower warned of the social and economic dangers inherent in the growing military-industrial complex, but his prescience has been disregarded, or, more sinisterly, has been overwhelmed by the strength of industrialists whose wealth and power seem to place them above control by the people. Yet, had Lewis' warning been heeded in 1945, Eisenhower's would have been unneeded ten years later. Both are still applicable today.Is there a solution to the encroachment of evil into human affairs? If there is, Lewis did not know of it. True, by the end of THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH, the tools of evil are dead and the N.I.C.E. organization is destroyed, but Lewis warns that this has been only a battle and that the war will continue in other places and in other ways.Lewis' message is, as I hope I have now shown, as uncomfortably real, urgent, and contemporary as it was when he wrote it. As to the manner in which he wrote it, this book is surely the strongest and most readable of the trilogy, which includes OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET and PERELANDRA. In fact, even though reading the trilogy in order will give the reader a better understanding of Ransom and how he came to be the \\"Director\\" of the \\"good guys,\\" this final book can easily stand alone and, if only one of the trilogy is to be read, would be my choice of the one to read. The other two, while worthy of being read, are, at times, plodding in contrast to this one, which is guaranteed to raise the reader's inner tension and to urge him ever forward in the saga.If there is a weakness in the plot of this third book, it comes in the means of bringing down N.I.C.E., its minions, and its masters. Readers familiar with Greek drama and its use of a \\"deus ex machina\\" to rescue hapless humans from their own foibles will see that Lewis has relied on a similar technique. Literally, several intermediate gods (inspired by medieval concepts of hierarchical levels in the universe) as well as a reawakened Merlin and a biblical \\"Tower of Babel\\" solution are necessary to defeat the enemy in this battle, and I'm not at all certain that any of these weapons are available to us in the \\"real world.\\" Despite this, however, the novel is as gripping as any conspiracy suspense thriller, a comparison I have borrowed from another reviewer because I can think of no better way of putting it. In short, buy the book, read it, and, most importantly, learn from it. I have."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is certainly a very enjoyable book, particularly for those who are already fans of Lewis. Feminists will be outraged (they should read it nonetheless); Lewis' unique understanding of the nature of masculinity and femininity are very much in evidence here. I found the book rather moving in certain places, especially the growth in understanding that we go through with the heroine, as she develops from secular (liberal) humanist into a Christian. Lewis' deep intuition around the relationship of human (conjugal) love to divine love is (I think) spot on, and probably the most interesting aspect of this book for me (the significance/danger of the \\"Baconian\\" attitude towards nature is more cleanly expressed in _Abolition of Man_). However, the ending of the book seems a bit too easy and optimistic.I picked up this book because, as Lewis says in the preface, \\"it has behind it the serious 'point' [he had] tried to make in [his] _Abolition of Man_.\\" The latter book is an absolute masterpiece, and I would highly suggest that it be read before _That Hideous Strength_. Nonetheless, this is an excellent fantasy novel, and much superior to what generally falls into that category."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"If you don't have time to read the other two, this one is well worth your time.

The book is packed with social and spiritual insight ranging from marriage, academic life, moral education, Humanism, human frailty, to the dangers of political power gone too far.Many C.S. Lewis fans will read this with Narnia or the first two science fiction works in mind, and this reviewer encourages them to not do so. As other reviewers have noted, it is a confusion if not a disappointment if read with the wrong expectations. Though some of the characters and themes are carried over from the first two science fiction books, it stands by itself.It is my opinion that there is a great deal to learn from the good dystoipas and that they are neglected to our own detriment. This is one of the great ones and is something to be soaked in and learned from."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The Space Trilogy of which &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; is the final installment is spiritual adventure candy for the soul. This is the first novel other than the Screwtape Letters that CS Lewis let's his comic side out to play.In the end the real issue is how the self anointed elite hatch their plans as if they alone matter and will decide what is best for those who don't matter. Quaint setting and uproariously funny moments do not detract from the sinister longings of the inner circle.Despite very eloquent and persuasive analysis to the contrary, the State, and other power groupings will not &quot;wither away&quot; anymore now than in CS Lewis' time. In fact the tyrannical impulse is alive and well and strangely enough abetted increasingly by both political parties and the media. If you enjoyed this trilogy.

Lewis' space trilogy I was excited to start reading the third book titled \\"That Hideous Strength.\\" It is the conclusion of the first two books \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra.\\" Unfortunately \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is much different than the first two books in the series. It is a \\"modern\\" fairytale tied to the legends of Merlin the wizard. The first two books were very original works, so it felt weird to have the possibility of Merlin suddenly joining the story (you will have to read the book to find out if he actually does). One of the strengths of the story, in terms of science fiction, was the part about the amoral use of science to create a hideous leader. There is also a reference to the moon, but it is very brief. The main theme of the story is about the spiritual corruption on planet Earth. Evil is often cloaked with the appearance of good. People often think themselves the opposite of what they really are. The author did a good job addressing these important issues, but I found the story itself gloomy and tiring to read. Much like \\"Screwtape Letters\\" this story makes good points but is not for someone looking for a cheerful read. There are a few cheerful moments in this book, but they are lacking.C. S. Lewis is a great author, but this story is not what I hoped for. The author describes this book as a fairytale for adults. It is more harsh and gloomy than the first two books in the trilogy. It does tie together with the first two books, but I had to do much reading before I saw the connection."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"That Hideous Strength may be Lewis' best fictional work. The novel does a fantastic job of combining spirituality and science in an interesting narrative.The story actually follows two characters: Jane Studdock, and her husband Mark. Jane's story follows her journey in meeting the character from the other books, and deals a lot with the spiritual aspects Lewis was interested in. Mark's story takes us to the villains of the novel, and explores whether man's investment in science is a gift to all of humanity, or another way some men can gain control over others.The story is, at heart, a cautionary tale about the perversion of science, and thus is a good companion to Lewis' nonfictional work &#34;The Abolition of Man.&#34;The only drawback I think exists in That Hideous Strength is that it relies heavily on Arthurian legend, which the book lingers on long enough, but f you have no knowledge of King Arthur, you might find yourself a bit lost."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis really grabs the academic and cultural environment that is constantly at war with God, trying to push him out of existence via the raw desire to be God ourselves.

While the sci-fi purist concept of a 'corporation' taking over and essentially looking to sterilize the planet and 'create the superior being' is well founded, Dr. Ransom's character really does little in this book other than 'sit and wait' for the higher forces to come to put a stop to it. The addition of Merlin was interesting insomuch as his dialog with Dr. Ransom, but the way in which he is sent to resolve the conflict at hand is a bit much, and to be honest entirely to grusome. Also, there is really little to no reason to empathize with the character of Mark, and Lewis' treatment of Jane is typically patriarchal to the point of (personal) insult. Even the fact that her name is &quot;jane&quot; (very non-entity-like) compared to &quot;Mark&quot; (apostle), is a bit much. But of course, that was part of the 'message' I was supposed to receive I suppose (being a female reader)."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Try and do a Jules Verne type story.

The atmosphere reminded me a lot of \\"1984,\\" but with an ending I felt was more consistent with my beliefs as a Christian and a bit more uplifting.

An absolute must-read for any Christian who wants to avoid being maninipulated by those with a non-Biblical worldview.

They're young, and figuring things out for themselves - figuring themselves out. The crisis that moves them through this process is the disintegration of their little university hamlet by dark powers of technology.C.S. Lewis was a bachelor at the time he wrote this, and a man's man and academic to boot, yet he portrays a sympathetic and believable Jane, the young new wife. His portrayal of Mark, her academic don husband, is less sympathetic and more caricature like. But however realistic they are, the story is a page turner. Lewis pens fantastic dialogue, while slowly racheting up the suspense, and unraveling the complicated tale.The story brings together several threads of Lewis' work: the space travels of Harry Ransom, the protagonist of Perelandra and Out of the Silent Planet; his piercing focus on the workings of human conscience and rationlization; and British legend and mythology.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"While this book had all the elements that I loved in the previous two books (satire, allegory, poetic description), it was really lacking the cohesion of the other two and was generally a disappointing end to theSpace Trilogy 3 Book Set Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra & That Hideous Strength C.S. Lewis. Lewis seems very caught up in the politics of academia for the first third of the book, and then suddenly remembers the fantasy genre. The last third of the book features a rather anti-climactic battle that seemed to be a pastiche of several different mythologies.All that said, there is still a lot of value in the book. There are some deftly drawn characters unlike anything I've read in other literature of the 1940s. Lewis' investigation of the complexities of marriage, while it does not go far enough, asks important questions that blend faith and sociology in provocative ways.If you have readOut of the Silent Planet (Space Trilogy, Book One)andPerelandra (Space Trilogy, Book 2)I would recommend that you finish the trilogy, if for no other reason than plot continuity. I will say that this book does not stand alone as one of Lewis' better works."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The N.I.C.E. (Nat'l Inst. for Controlled Experiments) wants that part of Bracton College's land that is said to contain the body of Merlin. Mark Studdock is drawn into the N.I.C.E, whose temporary headquarters are elsewhere, even as his wife Jane sees at first hand the things the N.I.C.E is doing. The two follow different paths throughout the book, each on different sides without realizing it. And it turns out that Merlin never really died, and furthermore, really was buried at Bracton College....The plot is much more complex than that, but that's the skeleton, stripped completely of flesh so as not to give away any surprises. The characterizations are good--some great. Jane is good--Mark is much better; literature has seldom had such a likeable twerp. Feverstone, Curry, Dimble, Ivy, the tramp, are all good. (McPhee, criticised as being 'unidimensional' by a previous reviewer, is, ironically enough, based on a man Lewis knew well.) Some of the best parts of the book are those that describe the politicking that goes on at Bracton and at N.I.C.E, and amusing little comments are strewn regularly throughout the text. However, the same previous reviewer is right on the mark in saying that the change in Ransom is both disappointing and unexplained, and I personally find some of Lewis's remarks on men and women grating. Some are funny, as when Jane wonders when Mark will really be back, thinking, 'for when men say that they will be away two days they mean that that is the minimum, and they hope to be away a week.'The way Jane despises women who shop for a new hat to comfort themselves and then turns right around and does the same thing is good too. What grates is the author's placid assumption, not that masculinity is good, but that it is the highest good, and that good spiritual beings grow more masculine as they grow more spiritual and perfect. That sort of thing can be ignored, however, especially on the second time through, and it's a rare reader who won't want ot read this book again. And then again."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This was by far my favorite of the trilogy (Perlandria was my least). First off, it is almost a misnomer to call them a trilogy. The style, feel, and even genre of this book is different than the other two. Lewis says that in the introduction, reading the other two is not even required to read this one (although it certainly does help, and I recommend very highly doing so).A lot of people are quick to criticize this book for the occasional slow part, the lack of focus on the main character of the other two, and having too much philosophy and ideals stuffed into too small a space.My main comment is that this book has to be read slowly. Lewis calls it a \\"Fairy tale for grown ups\\", but it is much more. There is so much philosophy, theology, social commentary and satire in there that if read as a quick fling sci fi or fantasy book, most of the point of it is missed. It encapsulates post-war england in a way that is truly striking: the hopes, the fears, the cynicism.I read this fast the first time, and thought a lot of it was kinda slow, but the end was great (but should have been longer), and that was that. But for some reason, in the years since I had read it the first time, it kept popping up in my mind. Situations from it would come out of nowhere, and whisper lessons to my mind.So, I just re-read it, but with much more intensity of thought, and time, and have completely fallen in love. It borders on the prophetic, in its strongest parts. And those are not in the action parts. The messages it bears are legion, if we are careful enough to listen!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Well, this was very disappointing. In the final chapter of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, he completely abandons almost everything that made the first two novels interesting. First, Dr. Ransom, the main character from the last books, is no longer the main character. Rather, two new characters, Mark and Jane, are the ones the reader sees most of the story through. Also, Lewis abandons most of the space theme as the characters stay Earthbound, losing much of the awe and wonder that characterized the settings of the first two novels. He also is way too analytical in this book as he is trying to refute some of the themes that make up the modern sci-fi movement of his time, as characterized by Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Really, this book is nearly 400 pages of debate, petty academic squabbles, and refutations, most of which hardly advances the story at all. And lastly, and perhaps the greatest tragedy of all, the entire story is anti-climatic. Not only do none of the characters really do anything to shape the story, but even Lewis admits, through the character of Dr. Ransom, that everyone was just observers and not movers. BORING! Still, some of the arguments that Lewis kicks around are interesting carry overs from the previous two novels, but this book completely failed as a story. Such a shame too. After \\"Perelandra,\\" this one had so much promise."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This trilogy may have been good if I read and spoke the King's English. I don't and it made for a very difficult read. I didn't make it through the first book. For me, it was a waste of my money. I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"It seems publishers are getting very sloppy with book printing. I purchased this book, along with the other two books in C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy and only one was printed without slanted text. I know it is only a paperback, and a $9.00 one at that, but money is being spent. I would recommend purchasing these Scribner books at a store (new or used) where you can purchase a copy that is not a defect. It defeats the purpose of a discount if the book is a defect. I believe the work of C.S. Lewis deserves better treatment. On a positive note, the cover design for this book, as well as for Perelandra and Out Of The Silent Planet, are very well done."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is not an easy book. Indeed its a badly disorganized book; the imagery is jumbled and confusing, the messages are difficult to disentangle, and the ending is confusing and leaves you wondering what moral Lewis was really trying to convey. And yet I love it. I often pick up and dip into at random, and marvel at the sparks of gold and deep haunting shadows on every page. Lewis melds the world of Arthurian mythology with the (to him) modern world of early post-war Britain, which itself now has a period charm of its own. On one side there is the world of the N.I.C.E. into which gullible Mark Studdock falls, its subtly perverted \\"scientific objectivity\\", the materialistic and nihilistic led by the satanically inspired, themselves the tools of the horrific \\"macrobes\\". On the other there hand is the Studdock's clarevoyant wife Jane and her new friends - the kingly Mr. Fisher-King, the homely Dennistons and Dimbles and the annoying but loveable McPhee. I love every last page - the descriptions of Bragdon Wood, the sad perversion of the \\"mad parson\\", the charismatic two-faced Feverston, the dunderheaded dons of the \\"Progressive Element\\", and who could forget Mr. Bultitude - \\"Last of the Seven Bears of Logres\\"?

It deftly analyzes many of the problems of modern secular relationships and the secular state. But the ending is a complete deus ex machina. The killing off of all the various \\"evil\\" characters also feels a bit sadistic at times. There's never much suspense about how it will end. This might have been less of a problem if I was reading it as the conclusion of the trilogy, but Lewis says in the introduction that this can be read on it's own, if less profitably. The emphasis should probably be on \\"less profitably\\"."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I came to this trilogy late, thanks to a friend who gave me the first book for my birthday. I read the three books in a row, almost without stopping.The narrative is rich and complex, the language beautiful and evocative ... This third volume, though, is a bit different from the first two, where the hero travelled to other planets. It might surprise, maybe even disappoint some readers, and yet, it concludes the trilogy beautifully, and effortlessly mingles elements of fantasy, science fiction and literary prowess.A must-read for Tolkien fans, or people who enjoyed the Chronicles of Narnia as children."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The third book of Lewis's Space Trilogy takes place on earth. Since it was written many decades ago the advances of science and the shifts in society make it seem dated, but the book is still relevant since human nature and the results of a lust for power have not changed.

It clearly reflects CSLewis' bitterness about some aspects of his own academic career. The constant uncertainty of ones standing, the unceasing tension, the inbred community on whose foibles ones livelihood depends. And, of course, the book is an expression of the not-unreasonable anxiety response at the time by professors of (a certain type of) religious faith to the overwhelming competitive successes of the hi-tech fields, at explaining the world and at bringing money into the universities.CSL is very skillful at demonizing (literally) his intellectual opponents. As so often happens, the villians redeem what would otherwise be a stodgy book with a canned plot (Merlin lives! Science is demonic! Reanimating dead human body-parts is baaaaad!). The good guys, even, unfortunately, Ransom, are totally blah, as Lord Feverstone might say. CSL's pretentious patronizing at its worst. Read it for the quirky character-villians, fully worthy of a James Bond flick or the Brit late-sixties TV show \\"The Avengers\\". They include a sadistic lesbian (nicknamed \\"The Fairy\\") who runs a private security force consisting entirely of sexy young women in uniform. When has CSL ever written anything anywhere near this campy?Today in the USA the commercial religious right claims CSL as one of theirs. I'm not at all sure he would like this. (It's hard to picture him voting for Sarah Palin!) Then again he probably wouldn't appreciate the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" video games either.Four stars for vivid narration and entertaining personalities, especially John Wither, a master of rhetorical misdirection, meanlingless reassurances, and impossible-to-follow advice. Judo with language.

As this book was my second foray into C.S Lewis, (the first being the fantastic \\"'Till We Have Faces\\", I never understood where people get the idea that this work has heavy Christian overtones. If anything, it delves into paganism, and what appears to be precursors to Scientology and other UFO cults. If Christianity is a major facet in CS's works, then he may be exploring the underlying knowledge that manifests itself into the various, usually bloated religions, an effort that would otherwise result in his excommunication, or worse."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"To be fair, I only rate Lewis' conclusion of his trilogy a 3 in relation to the other two volumes. The first was excellent and profound. The second, Christian allegory much less exciting than the Bible or history. Here, almost second-rate fantasy. Maybe Lewis was expressing strongly-held beliefs. I'm sure that his true students must know a lot about what he thought in 1946--more than I do.It was certainly a horrible time to look backward into the then-recent past. Even as good a writer as Lewis could hardly do justice to the real-death story of Hitler's attack on the world, and what it took to fight him (murderous Stalin as ally, two nuclear bombs, and then welcoming German scientists to build the military space program against the heirs of that ally).Yes, That Hideous Strength is imaginative fantasy, well written in parts, and with a few interesting points about the nasty illusions we prop up to keep our world going as-is. But earthshaking? Unfortunately, not anymore."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"A truly stunning book! Interesting how this book seems to be getting either 5 stars or 1 star. Like the story itself, there is polarization, no middle ground. This satirical comedy blends brilliant characters with an accelerating plot. The BEST thing is the true-life charecterization of the &quot;bad guys&quot; and the &quot;good guys&quot;. Modern 2-D writers paint the bad guys as blatent, psycopathic killers from the get-go. Lewis' bad guys are killers in disguise: socially acceptable, educated sophisticates who have literally duped themselves and they all distrust and despise each other. The good guys (i.e., &quot;fat Mrs. Dimble saying her prayers&quot;) are human, but trying really hard to do right.The second-best thing is all the spiritual/biblical parallels and symbols. It makes a powerful backdrop for Christians and a nagging echo, with a ring of truth, for atheists (or what Lewis called, &quot;materialists&quot;).The third-best thing was comedy. This was the funniest book I've ever read, but it's really not a comedy, no matter how you slice it. I can't remember the last time a mere book brought laughter to the point of tears and loss of bodily function (real-Merlin-fake Merlin and the banquet speeches at Belbury). Read 'em and weep."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"After reading or rereading the first two excellent books in C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy-- Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra -- it is almost impossible to keep from reading this book, its conclusion. Unfortunately, while the first two grow better with each rereading, this one grows more tedious. Mind you if you have never read it, do so. I am just suggesting that it is the weakest link. Lewis needs no praise and will not be diminished by any adverse criticism from me. He is intelligent, insightful, psychologically acute, imaginative, clever, urban, witty and literate, and everyone knows it. It is just that in this book he does it all a bit too much. This is the story of an impeding battle between the forces of good and evil. But what a cast of characters: archangelic beings, macrobes, a contraceptive subterranean lunar race, the Fisher King who is also Pendragon, a seeress of the House of Tudor, Merlin, magic out of Numinor the true West, a fortune inherited from an Indian Christian mystic, a Scottish skeptic, a menagerie of animals, earthly avatars of heavenly spirits, an institute the figurative and literal Head of which is a decapitated or rather decorporated mad scientist through which unearthly powers speak, and Withers the dithering deputy director who is so vague and obscurantist that one wonders how people in the evil institute (with the ironic acronymic name of NICE) even manage to put on their pants in the morning never mind engineer the extinction of the whole human race and the conquest of the entire universe. Add to all these of course the merely human elements of brutal police, ambitious and pretentious academics, narrow minded politicians and scientists. Lewis seems to want to pull it all together in one volume; he has everything here except moderation. And when the denouement comes, less than a handful of the evil are really in on it all, and almost none of the good forces are really needed. It is all very anticlimactic. There is a clever description of the politics of a small college, and a good recognition scene where Pendragon discovers himself to Merlin, and an initialllly enjoying citation of the maundering style of Withers (which CS seems to have so delighted in that he persisted in presenting it all through the text until it eventually becomes vastly annoying). Lots of insights too on every one of his favorite topics and pointed criticism on all his pet peeves, but do they all really need to be gathered here together? As in Perelandra this is an explicitly and essentially Christian book, possibly making the work of less appeal to readers who do not share that faith. And his attitude to the feminine, perhaps acceptable in his own day, is just too patronizing today. As I say, do read it, but it is by far the weakest of the three books."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I have been a life-long C.S. Lewis fan, and first tackled this book when I was probably about 12, returning to it often throughout the years (I am now 32). One of my favorite passages concerns the descent of the Eldila (especially Jupiter) into St. Anne's, although I thoroughly enjoyed the work as a whole. It can be a bit slow-going in parts, and definitely is &quot;British&quot; in numerous of its references, but all in all it's a great end to the series and a very instructive and entertaining story. Two quick comments here: an earlier reviewer wondered why Merlin was necessary and couldn't anyone have taken his role upon themselves. Lewis writes in the book how Merlin was needed because in life he had opened himself to the influence of spiritual powers in a way others hadn't, and that &quot;opening&quot; was what made him uniquely suited to the needs of the situation in the novel. As to the other reviewer's comments about Lewis not knowing a thing about women, and his views on contraception, it would seem that a fairer statement would be that Lewis' views did not correspond to the reviewer's, rather than a condemning statement about his views. I say this especially since I know many women who have absolutely no problem whatsoever with the views Lewis articulates in the book. Happy reading to all!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"'Out of the Silent Planet' was set on Mars, 'Perelandra' on Venus, so it is almost inevitable that 'That Hideous Strength' is set on Earth. Having journeyed through the Heavens, Ransom is now involved with a group of people, most of them Christians, in dealing with a demonically influenced organisation which has plans to eridicate the human race. Although Ransom is no longer the main character in this story, the others who take centre stage, notably the Studdocks, more than make up for this. The storyline is pacy with the occasional twist, and the characters, whilst some may not be three dimensional, certainly grab your attention.

As he does in \\"The Last Battle\\" in the Chronicles of Narnia; he tackles the question of how will this whole thing end? Our protagonist to answer this question is a somewhat lightweight \\"modern\\" academe, whose main goal in life seems to be to achieve recognition in continually less desirable circles. It is one of the many valuable life insights that Lewis works into his stories. Slow starting, the book picks up the pace as the sides begin to take shape, and as the inevitable collision between good and evil, with some highly unusual twists takes place. The last fifty pages or so are among the best that I've read in my reading life. Ten stars would hardly be enough to rate this book. One of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"\\"That Hideous Strength\\" (1945) is the third book in the Space Trilogy, but in many ways it is completely different than the first two books: \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" (1938) and \\"Perelandra\\" (1943). The first two books are written almost exclusively from the perspective of Dr. Ransom, but in this book it is usually Mark or Jane Studdock's perspective and never Dr. Ransom's. The first two books were fairly short novels, but this one is longer than both of the first two combined. The first two books take the reader to Mars (Malacandra) and Venus (Perelandra), but this book stays on Earth (Thulcandra). The first two books have a single protagonist, while this book has a group trying to work together.The story is set in post-war England in a small university town (Edgestow). Mark Studdock is a young professor who seems driven to always make his way into the inner circle. His wife, Jane, is being troubled by some disturbing dreams which the reader soon learns are clairvoyant. Through the early part of the book, Mark is pulled into the group N.I.C.E. (National Institute for Coordinated Experiments), while his wife finds herself pulled toward the group of heroes which oppose them. Much of the novel is about the gathering of the forces. Mark is drawn to N.I.C.E. by his ambition, but he does question many of the actions and thus finds himself in a tenuous position. Jane does not want to oppose Mark, but when N.I.C.E. tries to arrest her she has little choice but to go with the other side.There are some very interesting aspects of this book, and it definitely takes some chances in bringing in the King Arthur story and blending it with the Eldil story established in the first two books of the series. Lewis is clearly talking about fascism in many places in this book. For example, N.I.C.E.'s goals include elimination of people they consider backward and selective breeding. They control the state functions such as the police, as well as industry, educational institutions and the media. Lewis also takes aim at materialism and how it is ultimately incompatible with ethics. Lewis brings in some religious themes as well, such as the Tower of Babel scene near the end where the leaders of N.I.C.E. are no longer able to understand each other's language. In fact, the books title is taken from a poem and refers to the Tower of Babel.There were also some things which did not work for me in this novel. I did not understand why he felt it necessary to make Lord Feverstone in this story be the same person as Mr. Devine in \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". He never makes use of that aspect, and the two characters do not really act the same way. The story also takes a long time to develop, and it probably would have been better served to move the story forward at a quicker pace as he did in the first two books. That being said, Lewis did turn this around from what I thought was the weak-link in the series, \\"Perelandra\\". This book was nominated for the Retro Hugo in 1996 for novels written in the year 1945."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"All right, there are problems with this book. Lewis' NICE conquers not only England, but the entire world, while the world hardly seems to notice or care. Lewis never has been able to describe any organization that included more than a pub-full of members convincingly. His &quot;international conspiracy&quot; comes off a bit like Spectre without the pirhanhas or pretty girls. He tries McPhee out in the role of house skeptic and house clown, but he doesn't really work in either. And Lewis can't seem to make up his mind if he wants his good guys to practice Christian miracles or pagan magic; where in the Bible do angels possess people? (Comes of hanging around Charles Williams, I guess.)So why do I keep on reading the book? Partly because, like a stew, I can push the ingrediants I don't like to the side. And partly because the book contains some tasty little stylistic and conceptual tidbits, like the proper names, which Lewis fills out with some classic parody, the fun of bringing Merlin back to modern England, and the contrast between the tramp and the magician in the climactic scene.But as Lewis said of Macdonald, the preaching, which would be a defect in other books, is what really saves this one, in my opinion. That Hideous Strength shows a remarkable understanding of the mechanisms of human depravity and redemption. The book is far better on this score than George orwell's antiutopian classic, 1984. Moreover, there are some wonderfully prophetic and insightful passages. The book has, in my opinion, aged extremely well, as technology and the New Age movement have taken the old dream of man as God to new levels in recent years. Was NICE a prophecy of what computer and biotech geniuses are going to do with the human mind in the 21st Century? We'll wait and see."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis' apocolyptic vision of where mankind is headed hits far closer to the mark than the more widely read visions such as Brave New World and 1984. This is because Lewis recognizes that the evil lies not in technology or even politics but in the human heart.Lewis also shows a deeper understanding of how society functions -- as an investigative researcher I can vouch for the accuracy of his portrayal of how nefarious organizations manipulate the press, for example. He grasps what other writers never even seem to comprehend -- that it is the small choices made daily that lead down the path to Hell.As philosophy, as social commentary, or as a rolicking good story, That Hideous Strength is a compelling read."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis' book is the modern story of *sacred England*, which is, apparently, called &quot;Logres&quot;..of the legacy of King Arthur, in Service to the Christ-Consciousness.(And every nation, he tells us, has its &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;profane&quot; traditions, and its own Story.) Lewis &quot;wakes up&quot; Merlin the Magician and brings him into the 20th century, and enables the reader to accept, as well as know, him. And the same is true for the novelist's wonderful characterization of a *bear* who plays a very big part in the story. And many other beautifully drawn human (&quot;all TOO human&quot;, in some cases) characters.This book is one of the greatest visionary novels I have ever read (or, in this case, listened to on tape.) The last cassette is almost inexpressively, *impossibly* beautiful. It expresses a vision of Harmony among all the Kingdoms of Evolution, and a Harmony of a Sacred Chain of Being that leads through all these Kingdoms and Beyond, into realms one might call &quot;the realms of the gods&quot;, of &quot;Cosmic Astrology&quot; with the planets as living beings, all within One Living God. Hearing it is in a way an entering of Paradise. A Sacrament.I thought I would select a few passages to share:from the 11th cassette: &quot;She comes more near the Earth than she was wont to, to make Earth sane. Peralandra (note: the goddess Venus) is all about us, and Man is no longer isolated. We are now as we ought to be: between the angels, who are our elder brothers, and the beasts, who are our jesters, servants, and playfellows.&quot;from the 9th cassette: In this heighth, and depth, and breadth, the little idea of herself which she had hitherto called &quot;me&quot;, dropped down and vanished, unfluttering, into bottomless distance, like a bird in space, without air. The name &quot;me&quot; was the name of a being whose existence she had never suspected: a being that! did not yet fully exist, but whose existence was demanded. It was a person--not the person she had thought--yet also a thing: a *made* thing. Made to please Another, and in Him, to please all others..a thing being made at this very moment, without its choice, in a shape it had never dreamed of.from the 11th: &quot;Go, in obedience, and you will find love.&quot;ps: I just found the tapes to OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, the *1st* volume of this trilogy. _______"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Secular humanists will loathe it, but this is a great book.

Lewis does a great job throughout the space trilogy in communicating deep, complex ideas through fiction. He will always be my favorite author."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is the third and concluding book in Lewis's \\"Cosmic Trilogy\\". In it, Professor Ransom, the protagonist of the first two tales, is a secondary (but vital) character. This story, unlike the first two, which range from Mars to Venus, takes place in then-contemporary England, at a small university.It is, like the others, a not-very-subtle moral allegory; in fact, it is so direct that it is scarcely an allegory at all. It is frightening, in a literal sense, to realize that the over-the-top caricatures Lewis uses for his \\"bad guys\\" are become, in our times, so close to plausible as to give one the chills.As ever, Lewis ends up with a hammer-banging delivery of his moral, but the entire tale is so surreal that it scarcely harms the telling.The book is decent reading on its own, and essential if you have read the two that come before it."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I start with a quibble. Lewis's preface states, \\"If you ask why - intending to write about magicians, devils, pantomime animals, and planetary angels - I nonetheless begin with such hum-drum scenes and persons, I reply that I am following the traditional fairytale. We do not always notice its methods, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairytale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who made and first enjoyed the stories.\\" Lewis demonstrates a basic misunderstanding here, which can be cured by reading a hundred folktales in a row and noting the opening sentences: \\"Once, in another kingdom, not in this place ...\\"; \\"Once upon a time ...\\"; \\"Long ago in a galaxy far, far away ...\\" The air of what we now call social realism is banished with the very first sentence, and the \\"hum-drum\\" beginning is a more complex thing than Lewis imagines it to be.But my quibble is more than just a quibble, for it illustrates the basic failure of \\"That Hideous Strength\\". Lewis tries to blend the fantastic with the everyday, yes. But he also throws in a sort of creepy science fiction, Christianity, Arthurian legend, dystopia, and several other things besides, and the result is not a blend but a salad.The truth is, none of the books in the Cosmic trilogy quite comes off. The first is a kind of satire of H.G. Wells, which makes a hollow \\"ping\\" if you strike it. The second (and best) is a pure fantasy which happens to be set on Venus (just as a fantasy might be set in Ancient Greece or on a deserted island), which preaches just a little too much. And the third ... well, we return to the world of H.G. Wells (with a highly unfair and unflattering caricature of the man himself), but we also have pure Perelandran fantasy, and these two flavours clash all by themselves - never mind what else is in the book. And speaking of caricatures, there is MacPhee, an annoying cardboard portrait of an old tutor of Lewis's, who was himself, as far as I can tell, made of cardboard. (A much rounder portrait in the same vein is the Fox, in Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces\\" - in every way a better book.)HOWEVER ... I liked it. Individual scenes don't work together, but they frequently work. The narrative thread of the endearingly unendearing Mark Studdock is a worthwhile book in itself. It's hard, all said and done, to find a reader who doesn't enjoy this book.The Cosmic trilogy as a whole, however, must be written off as a failed experiment, by a writer who could do much better. In the following decade, he did."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is the worst (and final) book of Lewis' space trilogy. Here, his apparent lack of forethought and organization culminate in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" where Lewis seems to drift aimlessly among topics of space travel and other worlds, to British monarchistic nationalism, Arthurian legends, angelology, human psychology, reincarnation, mad scientists, and marriage life.In short, while I enjoyed \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and gained some pleasure from Perelandra, this final book was a horrible amalgamation of aimless themes, lacked a concise plot, and left the reader (at least this reader) disappointed."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Firstly let me say I'm an atheist; I find all religious beliefs to be rather silly.However this book (even more than its predecessors) is awful. It's not so much about Lewis's religious beliefs as about his politics and personal life; the whole thing is a huge compendium of Blimpish Tory ranting against anything vaguely liberal in Britain post-1945. Far and away Lewis's worst and most infuriating book. It is also embarrassingly, offensively, sexist (\\"Write no more books, have children instead\\").There is quite a lot of messed up sexism in the whole trilogy, even more so than Lewis's work in general. It seems to (mainly) boil down to a lot of the \\"essentialist male = closer to God\\" nonsense and monarchy-worship (Lewis was an ardent monarchist and distrusted democracy, as shown in this and other books).It seems to me that Lewis (to paraphrase Patricia Schroder) was scared by the whole notion of a woman who has a brain and a uterus.Lewis must have been going through a pretty bad time personally during and right after the war, to write such a bizarre, mean-spirited, book. Perhaps it's more about Lewis's own doubts, and his reaction to the general loss of religious faith caused by the war, as the book seems to be written to bolster his *own* faith.Also the book is downright illogical in it's perception of god (e.g. the Merlin character's pronouncements against Jane for using birth control; obviously Lewis's god couldn't cope with a diaphragm.......). If this is God's will, that we be governed by the apparent mentality of a sulky child, then indeed it is a toss-up which side is good and which evil"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"It's an old book as the cover and the pages are quite brittle.

The bad and the ugly: Lewis' writing style is haphazard at best--names changed sporadically without reason, numerous misspellings, random pieces of linguistic bravado which would be quite unintelligible to most readers, there was even a chapter, told in the first person, which so lost me that I still have no clue of the speaker's identity. There is nothing likable or interesting about most characters. Following the plot for the first half of the book is like slamming your head into a wall over and over and over and over... Instead of characters or a compelling storyline driving the narrative, this contains lengthy chapters of bone-numbing dialog, hopeless exposition, deus ex machina, and spontaneous, overly-complex descriptions. The conclusion was drawn out, confused, and hardly satisfying except for the fact that the good guys won (which we knew would happen anyway). The worst part is that one could catch glimpses of so many fabulous and compelling stories and characters just under the surface that would have made this an incredible novel had they been told and focused on instead.

While the sci-fi purist concept of a 'corporation' taking over and essentially looking to sterilize the planet and 'create the superior being' is well founded, Dr. Ransom's character really does little in this book other than 'sit and wait' for the higher forces to come to put a stop to it. The addition of Merlin was interesting insomuch as his dialog with Dr. Ransom, but the way in which he is sent to resolve the conflict at hand is a bit much, and to be honest entirely to grusome. Also, there is really little to no reason to empathize with the character of Mark, and Lewis' treatment of Jane is typically patriarchal to the point of (personal) insult. Even the fact that her name is &quot;jane&quot; (very non-entity-like) compared to &quot;Mark&quot; (apostle), is a bit much. But of course, that was part of the 'message' I was supposed to receive I suppose (being a female reader)."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The literary disaster that ends Lewis' 'Space Trilogy'.Unlikeable or unconvincing good guys, cardboard villains, and a wandering plot could not be spruced up into anything interesting, either by a surprise visit from an historical Merlin, reanimated human body parts, or even a grown bear thrown in as a full-fleged party member.Lewis over-reached himself in this one.

For its time it must have been fairly challenging.I read it ages ago, and it has stayed with me. Just glancing through again, the same images are revived. I can smell the atmosphere! It proves, to me anyway, that he was prophetic, poetic and immensly powerful in his visions. Start your journey into the black and white countryside of 40s England, but be prepared to be jolted to full colour senses as this tale twists and shakes to its destination.

All in all a very good book!!!!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"As in many of C.S. Lewis' other non-fiction works, he astutely articulates in That Hideous Strength the dangers of the \\"progressive\\" movement. On a side note, I find it amusing, at least, that the term Progressive should be utilized. It seems that in order to progress towards something, there needs be a stated goal. What is it for a \\"progressive\\"? If it turns out to be an apocalyptic, utopian vision wherein all are (voluntarily or involuntarily) made to hold hands and sing Kumbaya, or worse, an ode to the all powerful nanny state, then I most vociferously must object. I would not go in for totalitarianism, whether from the left or right (politically), secular or religious. If they want a revolution, like the Beatles, they can count me out! After all, the only genuine revolutionary is the God of Love, Jesus the Christ. Love, of course, meaning to desire the objective good of the other. I suspect that all leftist and \\"progressive\\" thought is merely trying to escape God and His Love. If one succeeds in this attempted escape, Hell is where they land...eternally. What is most puzzling is that they have the audacity, when this is suggested, to blame a \\"cruel, vindictive god\\". Notice I have neglected to capitalize the G in God. Even if they don't understand, those who reject God eternally, will still have a \\"god\\" and it is the \\"god of this world\\" and Satan certainly can be a cruel task master.As to the book, I highly recommend it. It is, in my opinion, (outside of The Screwtape Letters) C.S. Lewis' best fiction. I know some may reject my claim and make an opposing claim for the Chronicles of Narnia. However, in my opinion, the allegory is a tad to thick for my tastes. That Hideous Strength is a masterpiece for fiction from a Theistic reference point. C.S. Lewis was able integrate his non-fiction philosophy along with a compelling storyline and likeable (or detestable) characters. It must be said that Mr. Lewis is not a master of verbal caricature (like Dickens), symbolism (like Hawthorne), or even fantastical descriptions (like Tolkien). That being said, That Hideous Strength is a fast-moving (even more so if one has read the other two novels in this trilogy), enjoyable fantasy/scientific novel that could not be more relevant for our times.Finally, I suspect leftists, atheists, and \\"progressives\\" hate this novel due to the fact that it exposes them."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"\\"That Hideous Strength\\" is the 3rd and final book in C.S. Lewis' space trilogy. Although \\"That Hideous Strength\\" takes place entirely on Earth, supernatural elements from the first two books make an appearance in this one.Anytime a book (such as this one) makes me underline passages on nearly every page and anytime a book makes me stop to think about ideas or care about the characters or re-read passages for the sheer delight they bring, I know I've just read a classic.While difficult and dense at times, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is a classic that should provoke an enlightening joy in its readers!Lewis called his book \\"A fairy tale for grown ups,\\" which is actually a pretty good summary of the whole thing. What Lewis attempts (and mostly achieves) is to represent the invisible spiritual realities through the ordinary, humdrum things of the world. As in fairy tales, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" starts out with the ordinary but ends up in the most extraordinary way.I won't ruin the plot for those who haven't read it, but Lewis primarily deals with the life of a married couple, Mark and Jane Studdock. It's important that the novel begins with marriage, refers to marriage throughout, and ends with marriage. While marriage, especially one like the Studdock's, may seem humdrum, it is, in reality, a profound spiritual picture of both the union between Christ and the Church and of the union of love that is to exist among men.When I recently taught \\"That Hideous Strength\\" to a high school class in Apologetics at the classical Anglican school where I teach, I had them read the book through the lens of \\"influence,\\" \\"peer pressure,\\" and \\"motivations.\\" As you read the book, pay attention to why Mark and Jane acts the way they do, who influences them, and what their motivations are. Lewis has given us a profound imaginative look at how our lives are really governed. This book ended up being the perfect companion to my Apologetics class in which I tried to get my students to see the necessity of every Christian giving an account of the hope that is within them. We've also spent a lot of time this year talking about peer pressure and how it can lead Christians closer to or further away from God.Another way of reading \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is to look at it through the lens of the different worldviews that are presented. Among these are the unthinking atheism of Mark, the selfish practical atheism and individualism of Jane, the modernistic dream of human reason, a more postmodern mix of reason and the occult, and Christianity. It's fascinating to see the war of the worldviews at work in \\"That Hideous Strength\\"! Lewis clearly understood the spiritual state of England in 1946, and his analysis of that condition continues to have relevance for the Western world in the 21st century. Lewis' fairy tale succeeds in alerting his readers to the very real presence of the supernatural in our ordinary lives.One of the things that make the book such a joy to read is Lewis' insight into human nature. While the \\"I\\" passages of the book are unnecessarily obtrusive, Lewis nevertheless gives the reader a lot of keen insight into the nature of man, the nature of marriage, and the psychology that lies behind our thoughts and actions.Another sumptuous part of the novel is Lewis' language. As with so many of his other works, he has many quotable lines from either the characters or the narrators. At other times, a lyrical beauty sings through the passages, such as those where he describes the effects that earthly characters feel when in the presence of the eldil or angels.Even the plot itself, filled with most fantastic twists and turns and bizarre occurrences, will not only delight but also shock the reader into wanting to read until the consummation of events in the final chapter.Finally, I find Lewis' injection of not only Merlin but also Arthurian mythology to be not only out of place but also a positive distraction from the Christian meaning and symbolism of the rest of the novel. It's almost as if Lewis, being the classical and medieval scholar he was, couldn't help himself. It makes for fascinating reading, but it's not entirely favorable in its effect.In spite of a few odd things I didn't care for, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" remains a wonder and delight that I highly recommend to serious readers, especially those who are Christian."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"In 2004, I decided to begin reading through C.S. Lewis' \\"Space Trilogy.\\" I loved the first book, Out of the Silent Planet. Lewis turned upside down my expectations, as he imagined how sin would affect (or not affect) life on other planets. In 2005, I read the second book in the series, Perelandra. While I did not enjoy the second as much as the first, I recognized and appreciated Lewis' literary genius in recasting the Adam and Eve story.It took four years to get around to the third book in Lewis' trilogy. That Hideous Strength is quite different than the first two. All the action takes place on Earth. The book is about twice as long as the others. And the main character from the other books doesn't appear until midway through the story. This work reminds me of 1984, except that it starts out much slower and ends up with an explicitly Christian interpretation. I enjoyed parts of this book, particularly the ways in which Lewis pointed out the ease with which men of the academy can be led astray by the desire for popularity. But That Hideous Strength was my least favorite of the trilogy."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read a number of the negative reviews, and I can see how someone who doesn't share the religious views of Lewis might be put off. If a reader is not at all open to the possibility of the supernatural then this book might be tough going. But for anyone who has wondered, \\"How might a political conspiracy actually take place?\\", this is a must read. Whatever religious or political views one holds, to think that the main stream media is not even the least bit managed from \\"up top\\" is naive."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I wish I had time to give this a little longer review, because there's so much packed into this final story in the Ransom (or Space) Trilogy. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way Lewis blurs genre throughout the series. You can call the whole series \\"science fiction,\\" but that's not quite accurate. It best describes the first book Out of the Silent Planet , which Lewis writes as science fiction in the vein of H.G. Wells'The War of the Worlds, but with the intention of communicating a medieval cosmology. The second book Perelandra reads more like a myth. In many ways it's a re-imagining of Milton'sParadise Lost, except in this case, Paradise Retained. That Hideous Strength is a fairy tale, or romance. It's full of academic satire, Arthurian legend, and a critique of scientism and theological liberalism.It's the longest of the three books (longer than the first two combined), and it starts rather slowly. But it's worth trudging through the first 50 pages or so to get into the plot. The characters are thin (that's pretty normal for a fairy tale), but the focus is not in character development, but in ideas and ideologies and the battle between good and evil.Recommended for anyone interested in theology, medieval worldview, Arthurian legend, fairy tales for adults."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"C.S. Lewis has always been a favorite author of mine, and his \\"Space Trilogy\\" has always piqued my interest. However, I was never able to find it in bookstores or in libraries. I can understand some reasons why now that I've read the whole series, however, I still find it a travesty.This book, like the other books in the trilogy, take a while to get going, and this is by far the longest of the three, which means an even longer intro. However, the plot, once you start to realize what it is, plunges you into an epic battle between good and evil, right here in our world. The epic final confrontation so struck me that I am still having dreams about it, even weeks after I've finished reading the book.That being said, there are some things the average person should know. This book is not like his Narnia series. The writing and ideas are closer to \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" or \\"Mere Christianity\\" than they are to \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" or \\"Prince Caspian.\\" However, if you are of a more mature audience, and especially if you liked his previous novel in the trilogy \\"Perelandra,\\" you'd definitely enjoy this novel.While it isn't necessary to read the two preceding novels in the trilogy to understand this one, things make a lot more sense and the story is much richer because of it.Overall, a good read for those who grew up with Narnia, but are now more grown-up themselves."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is the third book in C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy. These books get progressivley more detailed, theological, \\"heady\\" as the series goes on. I think I would say that this is my favorite of the three, perhaps because it sums up the story of Elwin Ransom that was started in \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", or perhaps because it is just plain the weirdest out of the three. It has a rather gory ending, which is not to my personal taste, but the story ends very satisfactorily. I totally recommend the whole series, but this book especially is not for children. Also, it is not \\"light\\" reading, and takes some concentration and perseverance. Absolutely worth reading, if you like this genre and/or author. I would also receommend reading the three books in order."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"\\"That hideous strength\\" is a science fiction/fantasy novel by British writer C.S. Lewis, otherwise mostly known for his children's tales about Narnia. Lewis wrote a \\"space trilogy\\" for adults, of which \\"That hideous strength\\" is the concluding part. The novels of the trilogy can be read independently of each other.The plot of the novel revolves around a secret, evil brotherhood. The brotherhood, known as NICE, are a kind of anti-humanist, technology-worshipping Satanists. Their ostensible goal is to give humans eternal life through some kind of cloning. NICE probably symbolize the evils of modern, industrial civilization (and its enchanting allure). Their real goal is, in effect, the abolition of man. The rituals of NICE are based on conspiracy theories about secret Templar and Masonic rituals. Indeed, there is a strong atmosphere of conspiracy thinking in the novel. I'm surprised that it's almost never referenced by conspiracy theorists. Of course, the conspiracism is a literary device. There is nothing in Lewis' non-fiction indicating that he believed in conspiracies. Once again, my guess is that NICE is a symbol of modern science gone mad, and modernity in general being turned against humanity.Lewis was a fairly conservative Christian, and \\"That hideous strength\\" is therefore imbued with a Christian message and various supernatural elements. The scientists of NICE, at least initially, believe that they have cracked the secret of immortality through scientific means. In reality, their bizarre laboratory has been taken over by demons! NICE are challenged by a small group of Christians, led by the mysterious Elwin Ransom, who always reminded me of Jesus. Another supernatural character is the wizard Merlin. More annoying are the patriarchal elements of the story: marriage is for life, women should obey their husbands, and so on. Ransom is a pretty bad marriage counsellor! Another disturbing kind of Christian morality comes across when Merlin exclaims: \\"I'm not immoral. The only people I ever killed were heathen Saxons\\". So that makes it alright, then?Still, my main problem with \\"That hideous strength\\" isn't the conservative Christian message. Obviously, a Christian writer will write Christian books. The novel goes somewhat astray on two other points. First, there is a disconnect between the first part of the novel (almost a suspense thriller) and the second part, where Lewis introduces elements of Arthurian romance and a unexpected cross-over with the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien (!). I don't mind supernatural elements in sci fi novels, but these feel like the wrong kinds of supernatural elements. A charismatic revival is thrown in for good measure at the end, presumably as a foretaste of the apocalypse. Once again, the reader is left wondering what on earth is going on...The other problem I have is that Lewis somehow wanted to write a novel about pretty much everything. The introduction of a bear in the story becomes an opportunity to preach against pantheism. On another page, Lewis discusses various ways of approaching a spiritual conversion experience. And what attitude should true Christians have towards the House of Windsor? Stay tuned for a theologically correct answer. Rather than developing two or three (Christian) themes, Lewis wants to develop them all. It's almost as if he forgot that he was writing a novel, rather than a non-fiction book!That being said, I nevertheless found \\"That hideous strength\\" interesting, even intriguing. The criticism of mad science, phoney progress and secret elites was particularly interesting.

A must have for any lover of good scifi and spiritual traveller"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.-Exodus 33:19Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.&#8232;-Proverbs 4:7&#8232;I've read nearly all of C.S. Lewis's works (both fiction and non-fiction) and enjoyed all of them, but there are some works that remain with me more than others. His Space Trilogy (AKA, the Cosmic Trilogy or Ransom Trilogy) are the first novels of his that I read and remain my favorite among his works of fiction. I recognize that these are not his most popular works though (The Chronicles of Narnia holds that position). For many years I have wondered why? I think it comes down which of two attributes common to fantasy stories, mercy or wisdom, modern readers desire and which is emphasized more in each story.In the three most popular fantasy works of our time, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia and the Harry Potter series, either the underlying theme or the tipping point of the story was an act or attitude of mercy, (i.e. Frodo to Gollum, Aslan to Edmond and Eustace, Harry towards Peter Pettigrew and Dumbledore towards nearly everyone).However, in the books of Lewis's Space Trilogy the focus is on wisdom. As do most wisdom stories, these teach by example; either positive \\"this is what you should do\\" (as Professor Ransom, who starts out a good man in the first book of the trilogy, Out of The Silent Planet, and gets better as the books progress), or negative \\"this is what you should not do\\" (i.e. Mark Studdock's immature need to be part of the inner circle in the third book, That Hideous Strength). While these works are admired and have sold well, they are not in the same mega-bestseller class as are the \\"mercy\\" stories. Why is that? Were the sales of the Space Trilogy far below the Narnia stories simply because Narnia was aimed at children, who are believed to be a larger group of fantasy readers than adults? What about more recent books, like those of British writers J. K. Rowling or Susanna Clarke? Is it the writing? I think most critics would agree that, line for line; Clarke is a more sophisticated writer than Rowling, but it is Rowling who has become the richest woman in England through her writing.&#8232;I can understand why mercy is more popular than wisdom in our day. Wisdom may teach you how to fish, but when you are starving you don't want a fishing pole, you want food and you want it right now. Wisdom may keep you out of trouble, but mercy can get you out of the trouble you are already in. Wisdom is something that you must earn, it takes work. Mercy is something unearned; it is a gift freely given at no cost to you (though it may cost the giver dearly). It is not the innocent that need mercy; it is the guilty. Have you noticed that most children have no problem with the harsh punishments imposed upon the villains of fairy tales? It is we adults who find the justice severe in these tales and would like to see it tempered with mercy. Perhaps there are more adults in our society who feel that they need mercy than there are those who desire wisdom.&#8232;It may also be that mercy is more in keeping with what makes fantasy a different genre than other types of fiction. Frodo did not show mercy towards Gollum because he hoped that Gollum would ultimately save him from the evil power of the ring. Frodo's mercy was a gift; and, importantly, a gift from higher to lower. That this gift ended up saving the day was something of a miracle and miracles are what fantasy is all about.&#8232;Wisdom on the other hand is different. Wisdom is something you can learn; it is a skill, a technique, almost a technology. You expect it to work. Mercy is the gift of the underdog, the little guy, the weak. Wisdom is the tool of the favorite, the experienced, the one expected to win. Most heroes of fantasy stories these days start out as the underdog. But this was not always the case. Once upon a time princes and heroes were the main characters in fantasies and myths. Go back a few hundred years and it would have been Aragorn who destroyed the ring and Harry Potter would have been born a prince.&#8232;Historically, most fables and fairy tales were wisdom stories. \\"If you are foolish, bad things will happen to you\\" or \\"while the hero did something foolish to get himself into trouble, he was able to use the things he learned along his journey to get himself out.\\" Most of these stories are examples of problem solving and pluck. I find it interesting that, back in the days when most people believed in miracles, most fantasy tales emphasized wisdom. In our day, when most people don't believe in miracles, the most popular of fantasy stories emphasize mercy.Lewis's Space Trilogy harkens back to that earlier mode of storytelling. While they do contain elements of mercy, the gaining of wisdom is the main way the good characters grow in these tales. If your temperament leans more towards the gaining of wisdom rather than the showing of mercy, then Lewis's Space Trilogy are the books for you.NOBILIS VOS ESTOS,&#8232;William R.

Enjoyed the unexpected 'solution' and the treatment of certain 'historical' characters. I recommend the entire trilogy, but only for a thinking reader."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Originally posted at FanLit. Come visit us!\\"Nature is the ladder we have climbed up by. Now we kick her away.\\"That Hideous Strength is the final volume of C.S. Lewis's SPACE TRILOGY. This story, which could be categorized as science fiction, dystopian fiction, Arthurian legend, and Christian allegory, is different enough from the previous books, Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra, that you don't need to have read them, but it may help to vaguely familiarize yourself with their plots. Generally, in the previous stories, Dr. Elwin Ransom has been to both Mars and Venus and discovered that the planets are governed by heavenly beings and that Earth's governor is a fallen angel. These forces are at war and the fate of the universe is at stake.In That Hideous Strength, Ransom is back on Earth and is preparing a group of people who can fight the forces of evil. This evil is manifesting as a corporation called the National Institute of Coordinated Experimentation (N.I.C.E.) which is trying to purchase some wooded property owned by Bracton College at the University of Edgestow in England. To do this, they've had to exert their influence over some of the \\"progressive\\" faculty by getting them to buy into their subtle message of saving the human race through (but not obviously yet) sterilization, selective breeding, re-education, and biochemical conditioning. The end-goal, though they only talk about this in the inner circle, is a future in which the working class is no longer needed to support the brains that run the world. NICE wants the talents of the progressive faculty on their side as they generate propaganda, but they also want to recruit some more ancient magic -- they plan to dig up the body of Merlin, which they believe may be buried on the college's property.Dr. Mark Studdock, a sociologist and a new Bracton faculty member who doesn't feel like he quite fits in yet, is tempted to join NICE when they offer him a high-status job. At first Mark is suspicious of the group and their recruitment methods and he's bothered by the vague job description, but their insistence that they need him, their appeal to his vanity, and his low self esteem combine to make their offer seem attractive. Having left Bracton to join the NICE administration, Mark is unaware of the police tactics that NICE is using to make the college town comply with their new order. Meanwhile, also back at Bracton, Mark's new wife, Jane, is having ominous visions. Thinking she may be going crazy, she seeks help and ends up among the group, lead by Dr. Ransom, which is fighting NICE.One thing that C.S. Lewis does so well in this novel is to portray the slippery slope of Mark's gradual slide into evil which is caused by a lack of his own moral compass. Though he doesn't realize it at first, he is foremost a people-pleaser. He wants to increase his status in the eyes of both his colleagues and his wife, and though he's not actually concerned about his character for himself, he wants others to admire him. Wanting to seem both successful (financially and professionally) and of good character, and without any moral grounding of his own, he has no idea how to behave in this situation and eventually succumbs to the pressure. When he becomes better acquainted with NICE's tactics and plans, the cognitive dissonance he feels leads him to wholly embrace the evil. It doesn't help that Mark discovers that even when he tries to be good, there is no natural law that the universe must reward him for it.In contrast, characters who have a stronger sense of self, like Jane, have more concrete ideas about right and wrong and are not as easily influenced or corrupted. Yet Lewis doesn't condemn Mark while wholly commending Jane. Instead, Mark's inferiority complex seems heartbreaking, and Lewis makes Jane, an educated feminist, deal with her hatred of masculinity. Other good characters are forced to examine their own self-righteousness.Another thing that is beautifully done in That Hideous Strength is Lewis' melding of the ancient and new, especially in England's history -- the dark ages with its ancient forest magic, mythical creatures, and irrational superstition, and the new age of rationalism, science and technology. Lewis also speaks eloquently about the difference between organized religion and real spiritual experience. There are also some lovely literary allusions in That Hideous Strength; no fantasy literature lover is likely to miss Lewis' reference to the work of his friend J.R.R. Tolkien.That Hideous Strength is a deeply philosophical novel which, except for the mention of corsets, doesn't feel dated though it was published in 1945. Some readers may not appreciate all the philosophizing, but I am always fascinated by C.S. Lewis' ideas, finding them logical, enlightening, and superbly said. Some of these ideas can be found in his non-fiction works The Abolition of Man, Mere Christianity, God in the Dock, and probably others that I haven't read. That Hideous Strength -- in fact the entire SPACE TRILOGY -- is a profoundly thoughtful and beautiful work of science fiction. I recommend Blackstone Audio's version narrated by Geoffrey Howard."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis's writing seems always to be about the struggleof good and evil. His \\"evil\\", as I see it, consistsof a separation from the joy of love and life, and adescent into passionless, dull destruction andtime-wasting. While I am not a Christian, I deeplyappreciate his insights on how we get caught in habitsof this kind of evil, and drawn away from joy.Lewis's portrayal in this book of the advancement of evil through individuals' petty efforts at self-aggrandizement rang true. It was frightening to watch unfold through nearly content-free board meetings and hall conversations.There were also some choice insights in the course of the book about how we can help or hinder ourselves in being good. Lewis tends to be clear about the point that devotion to God (or goodness) has nothing to do with looking saintly every Sunday in the right sort of church, and everything to do with cultivating generous impulses, enjoying the life given to us, and being good to one another, without regard for personal status.I enjoyed the first part of the story quite a bit, as both literature and spiritual exploration. When Lewis suddenly introduced Martians (I am wildly oversimplifying for the sake of clarity) the effect was ludicrously awkward, IMHO, but I was willing to let it go, particularly since he had in fact spent two previous books, only one of which I've read, presenting these entities in more context.The ending, unfortunately, shared this awkwardness. After a book-long buildup, it seemed to all fly to pieces in a rather unsatisfying manner that felt less like a resolution than like Cecil B. DeMille pulling out all the stops and using all his ancient Roman and Biblical costumes, props, sets, and wild animals at once.Some great bits, good spiritual insights, thought-provoking, but flawed as a novel. I recommend it if you can forgive that and want some thoughts about goodness and evil to chew on."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This final book in Lewis' space trilogy is very different from its predecessors. It starts a lot more slowly, but builds to a higher crescendo. The characters are more nuanced, less like cardboard cutouts labeled \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\" Finally, more than the others, the ending is clear, timely, and very satisfying.It's hard to describe this book, but try to picture Orwell's 1984 rewritten from a Christian view. The world had not reached Orwell's nightmare, but was headed decisively in that direction. The leaders of that putsch had all too familiar an appearance, and were ready to make every use of people uncertain of their own morality.The end of the book, just a few pages following the end of the conflict, took me quite by surprise. (No, I won't give it away.) In retrospect, though, it makes a lot of sense. Lewis was acutely aware of mankind's combined nature, physical and spiritual, with no need for distinction to be made. In \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", Lewis stated the importance of physically kneeling to pray because of how the physical act of kneeling affects the mind made from that physical body. I am quite sure that the ending was written to be as devout as Lewis could possibly make it, and it is a very beautiful vision of sacred duty.This book is immensely more mature a work than the two that preceded it. The others create context for this one, but this stands very well by itself. If you have patience with its slow start, you may be happily surpised.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The final volume of Lewis's Space Trilogy is a major departure from the first two volumes, which really serve as a prologue for this novel, wherein the forces of God and Satan (or their allegorical equivalents) face off in final battle.Dr. Ransom, the hero of the first two books is a secondary - although quite significant character - in this book, and he doesn't even appear till over a hundred pages have passed. Instead, the story focuses on Jane and Mark, a newly married couple with difficulties already developing in their relationship.Although they are a couple, they are apart for most of the book, each involved in their own adventures. Mark is lured into the service of the sinister organization NICE, where he is convinced to do small services that seem legitimate enough but are designed to further their agenda. Meanwhile, Jane, plagued by clairvoyant visions, winds up joining with Dr. Ransom's group, which is out to save the world from NICE.Jane and Mark, physically separated and emotionally estranged, find themselves also on opposite sides in a cosmic conflict between good and evil. Although this is a high-stakes battle, it is not overly supernatural, as the forces of good and evil operate with human agents/pawns. And Lewis is not as interested in the adventure aspects of his story as using it as a vehicle for presenting certain theological (especially Christian) concepts in an entertaining manner.The end result is a story that is a bit dry in spots but generally good. This story is more sophisticated than the Narnia books, which are aimed towards a younger audience, but this trilogy is also not as much fun as the Chronicles of Narnia. If you read this trilogy expecting Narnia, you may be disappointed, as you will if you are expecting what is normally considered science fiction. On the other hand, if you want to read a thought-provoking fictional work, this may be to your liking."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The final book in Lewis's Space Trilogy finds Dr. Ransom confronting a huge international organization bent on the submission of the human race and given to all kinds of strange scientific experiments and with one supreme goal--to eliminate all free thinking and emotion. This organization, the N.I.C.E., uses the press, government reform programs, and all kinds of propaganda to make them seem like the new heroes in England, while slowly they subdue the government and begin a takeover of the world. It's Ransom's job to stop them, though this time he has some followers and aid from a recently awakened power that has long slept.True to his style, Lewis makes this a very entertaining novel with a great underlying message. It is very well-written and teeming with symbolism that ultimately denounces the love of science over the love of God.This book is a great read--highly recommended."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"As a fairy tale, this book starts off rather slowly (as many fairy tales do), but the action eventually picks up and the ending is good.

Lewis manages bring in several other mythologies into his own story, including Numinor (from his friend J.R.R. Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS) and Merlin (from the Arthurian saga).

These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"That Hideous Strength\\", the third volume in Lewis's \\"Space Trilogy\\", stands as central novel of his that gives me the most pleasure in reading it. While \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is certainly his best work, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is the central novel in my own imagination that I most sympathize with in terms of where I want to go with my own fiction.There is so much in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" that absolutely fascinates me, and much of the themes I also want to deal with in my own fiction. The abuse of language stands as one of the most terrifying elements in the novel. Wither stands as one of my personal favorites on the side of the N. I. C. E, as does Fairy Hardcastle. Wither is very developed and incredibly diabolical, and Fairy is a very masculine woman involved in sadistic police torture. The Nazis have a very strong place in this work. Much of the more hideous and hellish scenes in this book comes from the inclusion of the N. I. C. E as the dominant villainy that works evil throughout the text. Much of what they want to do tie into the Nazi movements, and each are equally terrible.The inclusion of Merlin makes it a much more interesting text, for there is the key theme of Nature against Anti-Nature, and Merlin very much is in harmony with Nature. What makes this such a strong work is that each group parallels the other, and wherever there is a vision of total evil there also stands an equally dramatic picture of that which is good.One thing that the critics seem to really harp on is the fact that this text has such a complex structure, but for myself that is one of the most exciting things about it. It is the fact that Lewis manages such a huge cast of characters, and does so rather well, that makes this one of my favorite of his novels, and certainly my pick for the Space Trilogy.While I respect \\"Perelandra\\" and find it a very fine artistic effort, it is this book that I keep picking up to reread when I make my jaunts through Lewis's imaginative gauntlets. This is truly the most fascinating of the \\"Space Trilogy\\".(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". I have published newly written reviews of \\"The Space Trilogy\\" composed long after I wrote the three original reviews of Lewis's science fiction.)..-----[In Late 1999 or early 2000 I also wrote this abandoned, unfinished review to \\"That Hideous Strength\\"]The first time I've heard of the trilogy, it was from a pastor's wife. I was only then reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS (this was back in 1994), and I decided I would try it. Being a fan of Narnia (although I do not like Lion nearly as much as the others), I figured this would be good also.THAT HIDEOUS STRENGHT, which is longer than the other two books combined, is a book like no other I've read. Its main weakness is it jumps from modern to mythical too soon. It is a novel of ideas, and then at the climax the story becomes mythical, with a violent ending. Also, Lewis assumes to much of the readers on the matter of Merlin. Merlin was an incubus, and had no father."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I am an avid reader of sci-fi and fantasy and finding good books that are Christian in that genre can be difficult. This is the third in a series called Lewis' \\"Space Trilogy.\\" The first two books, though set on other planets are more along the lines of works of fantasy than sci-fi. This one follows suit, though not set in space. It is set in post WW2 England and deals with a rich cast of characters facing an evil that wants to take over the country and ultimately the world. I highly recommend reading the first two books, Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra before you read this one but it is not necessary to do so as enough is explained that the reader won't feel lost without having done so. Lewis is a wonderful writer who gets the reader personally involved in the story and characters. I was so excited when this came out on Kindle and not simply as an audio book. I hadn't read it since I was a child, and gained a whole new understanding of the theology and issues that Lewis deals with in the book. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I enjoyed this book. As the third part of the Space Trilogy, it is VERY different in style. Whereas the first two basically follow the adventures of the main character Ransom on other planets, this one is set on earth, and follows a much larger set of characters with a more complex plot. It reads much more like a contemporary novel, switching between multiple threads of the plot, from several different character's points of view.Relative to the other two novels, this plot is downright labyrinthine, with a grand conspiracy to take over Britain and ultimately the world. On the surface this is a secular progressive movement, but below the surface are demonic elements (the dark eldila that we learn about in the previous books). Supernatural elements aside, the crazy plot with conspiracies within conspiracies reminds me of a Robert Ludlum novel (of course predating Ludlum by a few decades), and also (like classic Ludlum) the body count gets pretty high. Some of the occult elements of the conspiracy, and some of the serious-silliness also reminded me a bit of \\"Foucalt's Pendulum\\", although from a very different point of view from that novel. The whole plot is rather melodramatic, almost campy, and in parts Lewis's writing is rather cheeky, but this is also interspersed with more straightforward CS Lewis insights and thoughts into this, that, or the other thing (he's surprisingly insightful on marriage and relationships for a man who was a bachelor for most of his life). At times the plot suffers a bit under its own weight - there are some little strands that don't really go anywhere, and some characters that don't really matter, and some loose ends that don't quite get tied up. Lewis clearly likes his animal characters, but I found all the stuff with the bear and the other critters a bit silly and overdone. I also think the story could have been tighter as a standalone novel, without it being part of the \\"Space Trilogy\\" mythos, with the eldila and Oyeresu and Ransom and what not.As with the first two parts of the trilogy, a central theme is the dangers of \\"Modernism\\" or \\"Progressivism\\". With the larger cast of characters (vs just Weston as the main antagonist in the first two), Lewis gets to skewer many more caricatures of Modern thought. His main target remains scientific Materialism, but the bad guys include all manner of \\"Progressive\\" sociological thought (circa 1940s). It is striking how much of it rings true today, like we're still having the same debates, and the materialists and progressives of today are not that far removed from those of Lewis's day. I also thought Mark Studdock was an interesting character; I think he symbolizes all of Lewis's fears and suspicions of young academics (Lewis was a fairly senior professor by the time he published this). Studdock is thoroughly Modern in every respect, and as a result is continuously buffeted and blown about, going one direction and then another, always on the outside trying to be on the inside of something, anything. There's a quote, I'm not sure about the real attribution, about not being so open-minded that your brain falls out, and I think this is what Lewis has in mind with his portrain of Studdock. As I've read through the Space Trilogy, I really get the feeling that a lot of the characters and philosophies that Lewis disdains are drawn directly from Lewis's experiences with his fellow academics. It really comes through in this book - you get the feeling that Lewis wrote large parts of this book while sitting through interminable faculty meetings at Oxford.An interesting little tidbit is that Lewis borrows (or perhaps appropriates?) his friend Tolkien's concept of Numinor (Lewis's acknowledgment at the start of the book is amusing!) Now Lewis's book was published probably 6 or 8 years before The Lord of the Rings, and I suspect that the way Lewis ties in Numinor fairly literally with both our contemporary history as well as (for the purposes of this novel) a \\"historical\\" Arthurian Britain is probably not what Tolkien envisioned. It's a very minor part of the book (Numinor is mentioned by name only a couple of times) but I do wish Lewis would have skipped that, or just made up a different name for a mythical prehistorical age that fit the conception in this story."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is the second best novel I've ever read. It was a little difficult to read the first time, but then again I was twelve and wasn't so familiar with certain parts of the Arthurian Legend at the time. I have read it several times since then, however, I have only read the first two books of the Space Trilogy once. I have mentioned that this is the second best novel, the first would also be by C.S. Lewis. It is TILL WE HAVE FACES: A MYTH RETOLD.While many of his books are far more popular than THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH and TILL WE HAVE FACES, these two books are certainly his best works, and some of the best works in the English language.

The Space Trilogy is dated (Written during WWII), but is still engrossing and interesting. The fact that it has endured this long is a testament to the quality of the story.

That Hideous Strength is a bit harder to get through, but well worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I enjoyed the book, although I can't call it an easy read. The persistence required to read it reminded me of reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Time was needed between courses to digest what was presented and to appreciate what was next. I would think that one who would read this book would get a different message depending on what their experiences are to date, although this is true for many books, \\"That hideous strength\\" is in an elite category. I think it will be a different book the next time I read it.As for the message, I will not go and bore the reader with my impression.

Once I realized what it was truly about, it became much easier to wade through the diversions that are set up with too much going on about minute details and the thoughts of the characters. More action would have pleased me but I guess I am just accustomed to the masters of those kinds of books.One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it.I enjoyed this last book in the series more than the first two."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"As author of Project 314, I have a deep appreciation for the way that Lewis pits good vs. evil.

Mark, a young sociologist at a British University is offered a higher position with N.I.C.E., a sort-of-facade organization with a dark social agenda. Most interesting is the progression of thought by which Mark realizes his humanist or materialist presuppositions can lead to some shocking conclusions if followed through to their extreme. Intertwined are several connected storylines that sometimes delay the suspense of various climaxes within the story. While this was somewhat annoying, Lewis's witty writing kept me intrigued. Overall it was interesting how Lewis wove together philosophy with fantasy, and I was amused at his reference to Tolkien's land of Numinor as a historical reality."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"As a story, That Hideous Strength is of a lesser calibre than Out of the Silent Planet or Perelandra, the other books in the Cosmic Trilogy. As an allogory and as an exploration of ultimate Truth, however, That Hideous Strength is a wonderful book; it is theology dressed up as a story and, so long as one acknowledges this, it is a deeply satisfying book"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"That Hideous Strength is the culmination of Lewis's stylized creativity and his realizable mythology. This final book (in his acclaimed \\"space trilogy\\") introduces readers to a brilliant mundaneness--a setting where both nothing and everything could happen simultaneously. It is a sleepy, stubborn, stubbornly sleepy novel that awakens to the furious dawn of Lewis's imagery and insight. Lewis has once again shown himself to be an excellent writer but more shocking than that...a eerily accurate kind of prognosticator. Futurity meets creativity in this work!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Shall I throw this book across the room because its plot hinges on forcing its heroine to accept her &quot;proper role&quot; as a woman in the mainstream Christianity of the era in which Lewis wrote it? Or shall I enjoy it on its own terms? I had to make up my mind about that as soon as I realized where the author was taking me, and at that point I put it aside overnight. With bookmark removed, because I intended to return it whence it was borrowed without reading further.I found my place again the next evening, and I kept on. I'm glad I did. While certainly I didn't wind up persuaded that birth control is an evil that prevents &quot;preordained&quot; conceptions from taking place, nor did I buy for a minute the notion that Jane Studdock could only gain both salvation and happiness by abandoning her doctoral thesis for a life of childbearing, I found the rest of the book thoroughly entertaining as a dark science fantasy. Lewis's wit more than redeems the rather heavy-handed allegory that the plot doesn't pretend to cloak. He takes myth and Christian doctrine, and settings and characters from his own time and place, and weaves it all together into a fast-moving and memorable tale. If he had only known the first thing about women, instead of sounding always like a bachelor uncle...or if only, as in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet,&quot; he'd had the good sense not to attempt writing them as major characters."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I advanced as you're supposed to through this trilogy of works, and found as I read them they became more compelling and each better than the one before it. Currently my favourite fictional work is 'Perelandra,' which is the second book in the trilogy.This work does start out slowly but upon re-reading it one can see that it is indeed compelling from the get go and rife with the themes and turmoil which become widely apparent later in the novel. One should try to not be so intellectually inept as to not see what is going on until after the character in the book you're reading does, try in the beginning and realise that this work is a critique on various social events and systems which have arisen in modern history; Multiculturalism/Immigration, Feminism, Materialism, Intellectual slavery/Censorship, and Fascism as well as Statist points of view in general.This work shows the importance of family, proper social order and personal liberty and intellectual freedom. It is a darker genre than you may be used to, but as we live in dark times so why should this novel of a prophet who only saw what was being sown has not lived truly through what we're reaping be any different? Truly this is compelling and really engaged me as a person to question the question of gender relations (although this is not the defining work on such an issue). This work also I found to really touch on the collective unconsciousness of my heritage and has many mythos and folkish aspects which I loved. Truly it is a culmination of the trilogy albeit a break from the pace of the rest as the old favourite - Dr. Ransom is not the main character he's just a supplementary one. The fact is that it really did anger me that he wasn't the major character in the book but it's nice to see how one as advanced as Ransom can influence for the sake of their spirit the lost around him. So there is a lot to say for this book, and truly it is an intellectual, spiritual, and fantastic experience to say the least."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Having enjoyed this novel again and again for a generation, I believe that it is prophetic and even more relevant today than when it was written. Now that recent filmings of Lord of the Ring and the first Narnia book have delighted critics and the public alike, is it too much to hope for a high-quality cinematic version someday of _That Hideous Strength_? Lewis would be most pleased, I daresay, if any such adaptation were set in our own time, because we need its messsage now.By the time Mark Studdock arrives at Belbury, he is a confirmed brown-nose with considerable experience in pursuing his life's ambition: joining the esoteric Inner Circle of whatever. It is striking, then, how much difficulty he has in the NICE even determining who is in this group. Feverstone, Filostrato, Hardcastle, and Straik, for instance, all confide to him that their own respective purviews are of the institute's essence, while various other departments are peripheral or merely for public consumption. By the end of the book, the chaos proclaims that none of these figures, nor anyone else, is effectively in charge.In this respect, Lewis brilliantly anticipated insights that the late William Stringfellow would articulate in the 1960s and 70s: that institutions are among the contemporary world's most characteristic manifestations of the demonic \\"powers and principalities\\" mentioned in the Bible. They inevitably take on lives of their own and go off the rails. Eventually they justify any and all means towards the end of their own survival and hegemony. They enslave and \\"deplete the personhood of\\" every human being involved with them-- even (and perhaps especially) those who imagine that they are in control.Of course, the church as an institution being hardly exempt from these problems, clergy would react to Stringfellow's analysis with hostility proportionate to their power. Ironically, the works of this theologian long lay in unread obscurity in seminary: while students in, of all places, law school continued to turn to them when they wanted to learn how corporate structures really operate. As we 21st-century Americans find ourselves steeped in the waking nightmare of an unfolding vindication of Stringfellow's prophetic thought, it is heartening at least to see a growing interest in it-- books lately republished and his ideas taken up and further developed e.g. by Walter Wink. For an illustrative novel, however, _That Hideous Strength_, written by C.S. Lewis some 25 years earlier, may yet be unsurpasssed.Some commentators have incomprehensibly indicated that the NICE people were materialists. Pas du tout. They are probably ex-materialists, but by the time we meet them are devotees of the occult. The reader grasps the inevitability of this progression. As Muggeridge (and perhaps Chesterton earlier) observed, those who cease to believe in God don't believe in nothing. Rather, before long they'll believe in anything. Lewis must have been aware of the occult dabbling practiced by high-level Nazi figures. While there are always atheistic individuals, it is unlikely, despite their best efforts, that their grandchildren will inherit a trait that requires so much mental assiduity to maintain. There have been no viable large atheistic societies. The Belburians, however, present themselves as materialists and are not prepared, and would probably never be prepared, to publicize their real allegiance: it is esoteric, elite, and exclusive by its very nature, not to be shared by the likes of you and me.Sitting in the garden, one of them exclaims, \\"Bloody racket those birds make!\\" Such a sentiment is revealing and chacteristic of one who, as the novel describes in detail, far from being a materialist, has cultivated a disgust for all things physical and who dreams of transcending it. Add this trait to a quest for esoteric knowledge and we have the two most classic marks of the gnostic.I have no doubt that Lewis intended the book partly as a warning against this mode of thought, which Christian orthodoxy has found profoundly and decisively incompatible. He illustrates what kind of people are tempted to take it up, why they do so, and to what bad ends it will lead. Since Lewis's death, it has become fashionable among post-modernists and certain feminists to express their pique and scorn for Christianity by affecting a sympathetic reconsideration of gnosticism, suggesting that its eclipse was only an historical accident or the effect of a political power play. We could do with this book as an antidote."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Silly heading, but nobody reads them anyway. I think. The third and last book in the trilogy (you did read the others, right?) and about as far from science fiction as you can possibly get . . . there's a definite shift, Lewis seems to be bringing in more fantasy and religious allegorical elements as the series continued, with the end result here. The tale is subtitled &quot;A Fairy Tale for Grown-Ups&quot; and that's what it boils down to. If you're like me, you'll have read this right after reading the other two books (which were great, by the way) and you'll be immediately confused. Instead of focusing on the nifty Dr Ransom, you get a young couple Mark and Jane. Jane's having weird dreams that keep coming true and Mark isn't really paying attention because he's trying to get into the political &quot;circles&quot; as the local university where he works. However, little does he know that evil is lurking there and the folks are plotting some very dark things. Herein comes the good guys and after being introduced to lots o' supporting characters, some of which are interesting, some less so, you finally meet the man himself: Ransom. The problem I have, and this has been said elsewhere, is that he's apparently the &quot;Pendragon&quot; (but also the Fisher King . . . weren't they two different people?) but there's absolutely no explanation as to how that happened. Lewis probably figured it wasn't important and not relevant to the story itself, heck, Ransom's discussion of how he inherited the mantle of the Pendragon is basically tossed off in one sentence. The first half of the book mostly focuses on the college and the dread blokes there, but when Ransom and company shows up finally, things get very trippy indeed. Perelandra was a strange novel because of setting but I could deal with that, Lewis piles so much allegory on the plot that it gets almost ridiculous. And then Merlin shows up. That's right. Merlin. He's kinda fun actually but much like Ransom becomes, he's little more than a voice, you don't get any indication of his motivations. All that said though, this is a nifty way to end the series, the climax left me a little flat, especially after the buildup in the first two books (Merlin makes some stuff happen and the gods blow some stuff up) but Lewis' mastery of the English language saves this completely, this guy was passionate about this novel and you can tell, it crackles from every page and you can really feel it toward the end in almost every word. There's a nice &quot;Britishness&quot; about the book as well, a sense of the sheer age of Britain and its history. The ending is kind and gentle and you're left with a good feeling when you finish the book. If you don't like Lewis for his &quot;preachiness&quot; then stay far away if you don't like thinking, because he's using this more to illustrate a point more than anything else, but it's fine writing and a fine cap to an interesting series. And for those of you who started reading this series because it was science fictional, don't stop now, y'all could stand to read something different every once in a while. It won't hurt. Really."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"C. S. Lewis wraps up his &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; right back on planet Earth where it is up to a cadre of ordinary folks, mythical beings, and brute beasts to thwart the forces of supreme wickedness. With the assistance of the Director--a man familiar to readers of the previous two books in the trilogy--this strange collection of characters is pitted against a vaguely-familiar, propaganda-driven totalitarian regime ironically called by the acronym NICE.This book is Lewis at his satirical best--an uppercut landed to the jaw of secular, anti-family, &quot;post-christian&quot; society.What is particularly striking about this book is who Lewis fingers as the advance-guard for the evil that sadly dominates on Earth, ever trying to extend its power: a bunch of place-seeking, ethics-free, jive-talking academics who have long left any pretense to reason and science behind. Instead, they are driven by a misguided altruism that manifests itself, ultimately, as complete misanthropy.In this regard, Lewis must be regarded as prescient. Anyone who has spent any time in American academia will immediately sympathize with the plight of the characters in the book who *dare* to stand up to the censorial, elitist, marxist/leninist, anti-religion, pro-death agenda so prevalent among the &quot;progressive&quot; leadership of the university. Lewis had these people's number fifty years ago.In short, this book is a fun read and though couched in humorous terms, is deadly serious at its core."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis's writing these days is widely regarded as of exclusive interest to the God Squad and that is a pity. Certainly this is a work of pretty straightforward religious propaganda, a supernatural thriller written by someone who takes the supernatural stuff with the utmost seriousness but, hey, so is \\"The Exorcist\\" and that needn't disqualify it from entertaining the unconverted.This novel is the last and the only earthbound instalment of Lewis's Space trilogy. It's a theological; thriller in which the forces of darkness are seeking to destroy humanity through the agency of the sinister National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments or NICE.The plot had two distinct threads. One involves Mark Studdock, a young don at the rather All-Souls-like Bracton College in the fictitious English town of Edgestow (which Lewis in a preface insists is not based on Durham). Mark is a weak man with a desperate desire for recognition and inclusion and is all to easily sucked into the unpleasant world of NICE. He fondly imagines they are headhunting him in recognition of his many talents but in fact they are mainly interested in him as a way to get at his wife, Jane, whose visionary dreams they perceive, rightly, as a threat. And Jane is the subject of the second plot line. While Mark is being sucked in to the world of the baddies at their headquarters at Belbury, a former blood transfusion centre, Jane is falling in with the goodies, a disparate band of desperately nice people at the manor at St Anne's, under the leadership of the charismatic Director, the Ransom of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra\\".The St Anne's parts of the story are the less impressive. Ransom has been turned by his experiences on Mars and Venus into an outrageously charismatic, ageless and near-superhuman religious leader who is really a lot less interesting than the very human Ransom of the earlier stories and who spends most of his time delivering rather dull and condescending anti-feminist lectures to Jane. (We are constantly told she would ordinarily have found such lectures insufferable but he is just so charismatic, you see...) Recently fashionable stuff about the wisdom of being a \\"surrendered wife\\" really just recapitulates Ransom's line here though Lewis surely writes far better than more recent advocates of such doubtful ideas and perhaps succeeds making them as attractive and compelling as it is humanly possible to make them.The Belbury-Mark story is a lot more fun and comprises a splendid and acute essay in political satire. The picture it paints of a grimly rotten beaurocratic institution guided by what pass for \\"progressive\\" social ideals is one of the nicest things Lewis ever wrote. (Lewis's intellectual agenda here echoes in a fictional context thoughts he develops in \\"The Abolition of Man\\", one of his most interesting non-fiction essays.) Particularly well done is Belbury's \\"Deputy Director\\" Wither, whose talks a wonderful and hilarious form of verbal anti-matter that is all too recognisable as only a slight exaggeration of the worst sort of British public sector Managementspeak. The news management techniques espoused by the NICE are again satirically telling and in a strikingly contemporary way: New Labour, one fears, would have loved the NICE with their fascination with spin and \\"modernization\\".Perhaps the best and most insightful thing about the book is the characterization of Mark Studdock, an extremely telling, frighteningly plausible portrait of a man drawn into collaboration with evil not by wickedness but by weakness, a desperation to belong, to feel himself accepted in the world of those who wield the power and pull the strings. It's enormously unlikely that Hitler's Germany or Mao's China contained enough simply wicked people to sustain such poisonous regimes. But it is also enormously likely that they contained many many people who were foolish and weak in just the ways Mark Studdock was, people whose collaboporation makes them appropriate objects more for pity than for hatred.The climax is inevitably rather over the top, involving as it does the resurrection of the Arthurian druid Merlin whose ancient powers are crucial to determining the outcome of the conflict. Obviously things get a bit bonkers at this point but Lewis is rare among thriller writers for his scholarship and has the erudition in matters Arthurian to carry it off as well as anyone ever could. A real curiosity then, strange and sometimes a bit nuts but also very well-written, satirically telling, often psychologically and politically insightful and very readable."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is the third and final book in C.S. Lewis's amazing Space Trilogy. This book was written as a sequel to the immensely popular Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra but Lewis also wrote it so that the story can stand on its own. So if you haven't read the first, you can start here.That Hideous Strength, unlike the first 2 books in this series, where Ransom leaves earth and fights evil in space and on other planets, the battle in this book takes place on earth.Ransom must lead a group of faithful believers against National Institute for Coordinated Experiments or N.I.C.E., an organization that believes that Science can solve all of humanity's problems. He must battle the people in this organization, super aliens trying to invade and control earth and use its population against other planets and against God.On top of all of that, Merlin has arisen from his long sleep and has arisen in England's time of greatest need. But the question is, who will find him first - N.I.C.E. or Ransom and his team? The fate of the world, and possibly the universe, rests on this question.Lewis called this story an adult's fairy-tale. It is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy, and a book that will keep your attention as you raptly turn the pages to find out where Lewis will lead you."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Many fans of Lewis' work rate this least of the Space Trilogy books; it lacks \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\"'s wonder and \\"Perelandra\\"'s lyricism. However, for a look at where a situationally-moral, rationalist, humanist society is bound to wind up, it is priceless.The main characters are a young couple who got married out of love and are finding it hard going in \\"the real world\\". The wife, Jane, has an unusual ability to 'dream true' and when her dreams start applying to her own life, she finds it unsettling. Her husband, Mark, a young don (or professor) is no help; he's too wound up in college politics (and some very loathesome friends) and the possibility of a job with a new scientific foundation to pay much attention to her.The story really begins moving when the foundation, called Belbury, begins moving in on everyday life. But, as always with Lewis, there is a moral opposite ready to stand against Belbury; in it, we find an old friend and several new ones.This book is astonishingly accurate about where society is now -- as with some of Lewis' other observations (Screwtape's toast to the college comes to mind), it's hard to remember that Lewis wrote them nearly 50 years ago -- they're that close to current events and modern society."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"C.S. Lewis would not have named this series the Space Trilogy. He used the term Deep Heaven for \\"the packed reality that men call empty space.\\" Everyone else doesn't have a problem with the title so much as the fact that the boxed set of the three books is continually out of print.Of the three books, I think the second, Perelandra, alternately called Voyage to Venus, is the best. Yet the effect of reading the trilogy together and in order is better than that book alone. The first book, Out of the Silent Planet, is gripping so far as it goes. A friend of mine said the second book, Perelandra, was the best book she'd ever read. But I'd never considered the third book, That Hideous Strength on its own merits until I read an essay by philosophy prof Richard Purtill entitled \\"That Hideous Strength: A Double Tale.\\" Before that I viewed the last book as starting rather slow, even though it picks up half way through and pulls the three books through to a dazzling ending.The trilogy is written at a higher reading level than the Narnian Chronicles (the latter were meant for kids), although it's arguably easier to read than The Lord of the Rings. Note: Purtill's essay is scheduled to be included in the revised edition of Lord of the Elves and Eldils: Philosophy and Fantasy in Lewis and Tolkien due out sometime in 2006, along with his most popular essay, \\"Did C.S. Lewis Lose His Faith?\\" which argues against the view implied in the film Shadowlands that he did.The Narnian film may be introducing readers to the books, which, whatever one thinks of the film, is a good thing. But readers closing the Chronicles will be glad to find their way into Lewis' Deep Heaven and the rest of his fiction."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"In \\"That Hideous Strength\\", C.S. Lewis brings his SciFi trilogy back to Earth and takes it in a different direction. The first book, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", and the second, \\"Perelandra\\" use space travel and encounters with inhabitants of Mars and Venus respectively as vehicles for Lewis' spiritual allegory. \\"That Hideous Strength\\" leaves space travel behind and feels more like a horror story in which the forces of evil conspire against goodness on Earth. Of the three books, this one is the least fun, but it is the one with the most memorable depiction of the means by which the dark side manipulates human perceptions to destroy impulses toward goodness, hope, and love.I first read this book in the 1970's. Frequently over the years since, while looking at paintings in museums, Lewis' words in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" have come back to me as an alternate angle for assessment of the art in front of me."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I have read this book several times and each time I pick it up find it hard to put it down. C.S. Lewis' satirical insights and observations of human nature are not only the stuff of genius but just as relevant now as they were sixty years ago.The story is engaging from the very beginning, even though it starts \\"innocently\\" enough with the course of a young married couple who put their own selfish ambitions ahead of each other. They are drawn into spiritual worlds quite opposite from one another and the story just continues to build in scale and tension as it heads for its climax. C.S. Lewis was a marvel in particular of his understanding of how evil minds operate (see \\"The Screwtape Letters\\"), their political machinations, and how they can suck others into a web of self-destruction by appealing first and foremost to the ego.I am not surprised to read some of the reasons for some of the negative reviews posted here as they reflect common disappointments with this, the third book in the so-called \\"Space Trilogy.\\" For one, this third book is different in tone and setting and use of characters than the previous two, perhaps undermining expectations for readers of the first two novels. Don't let that affect your judgment of the book because it is a brilliant conclusion to the series, and one of the reasons I think so is because of the differences I mentioned. A recurring theme in C.S. Lewis' writings is how people put God in a box with preconceived notions of religiosity and that theme is constantly visited in \\"That Hideous Strength\\". So it is only appropriate if this book does not fit in with readers' preconceived notions of plot and setting!Further, if one does not approve of Lewis' depiction of the roles of husband and wife, then one must also take issue with the Bible itself, for it is from that source that Lewis draws his point of view on the subject.Wonderful, entertaining and wise, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is full of the kind of clever insights and different ways of looking at things that make C.S. Lewis' writings so endearing. It is my favorite book in the series."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Hidden in this excellent science-fiction novel is a startling look at our own society.

This, however, sets the stage for the fantastic. Never before had Greek mythology or the Arthurian legends held any appeal for me.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"\\"That Hideous Strength\\" is the 3rd and final book in C.S. Lewis' space trilogy. Although \\"That Hideous Strength\\" takes place entirely on Earth, supernatural elements from the first two books make an appearance in this one.Anytime a book (such as this one) makes me underline passages on nearly every page and anytime a book makes me stop to think about ideas or care about the characters or re-read passages for the sheer delight they bring, I know I've just read a classic.While difficult and dense at times, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is a classic that should provoke an enlightening joy in its readers!Lewis called his book \\"A fairy tale for grown ups,\\" which is actually a pretty good summary of the whole thing. What Lewis attempts (and mostly achieves) is to represent the invisible spiritual realities through the ordinary, humdrum things of the world. As in fairy tales, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" starts out with the ordinary but ends up in the most extraordinary way.I won't ruin the plot for those who haven't read it, but Lewis primarily deals with the life of a married couple, Mark and Jane Studdock. It's important that the novel begins with marriage, refers to marriage throughout, and ends with marriage. While marriage, especially one like the Studdock's, may seem humdrum, it is, in reality, a profound spiritual picture of both the union between Christ and the Church and of the union of love that is to exist among men.When I recently taught \\"That Hideous Strength\\" to a high school class in Apologetics at the classical Anglican school where I teach, I had them read the book through the lens of \\"influence,\\" \\"peer pressure,\\" and \\"motivations.\\" As you read the book, pay attention to why Mark and Jane acts the way they do, who influences them, and what their motivations are. Lewis has given us a profound imaginative look at how our lives are really governed. This book ended up being the perfect companion to my Apologetics class in which I tried to get my students to see the necessity of every Christian giving an account of the hope that is within them. We've also spent a lot of time this year talking about peer pressure and how it can lead Christians closer to or further away from God.Another way of reading \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is to look at it through the lens of the different worldviews that are presented. Among these are the unthinking atheism of Mark, the selfish practical atheism and individualism of Jane, the modernistic dream of human reason, a more postmodern mix of reason and the occult, and Christianity. It's fascinating to see the war of the worldviews at work in \\"That Hideous Strength\\"! Lewis clearly understood the spiritual state of England in 1946, and his analysis of that condition continues to have relevance for the Western world in the 21st century. Lewis' fairy tale succeeds in alerting his readers to the very real presence of the supernatural in our ordinary lives.One of the things that make the book such a joy to read is Lewis' insight into human nature. While the \\"I\\" passages of the book are unnecessarily obtrusive, Lewis nevertheless gives the reader a lot of keen insight into the nature of man, the nature of marriage, and the psychology that lies behind our thoughts and actions.Another sumptuous part of the novel is Lewis' language. As with so many of his other works, he has many quotable lines from either the characters or the narrators. At other times, a lyrical beauty sings through the passages, such as those where he describes the effects that earthly characters feel when in the presence of the eldil or angels.Even the plot itself, filled with most fantastic twists and turns and bizarre occurrences, will not only delight but also shock the reader into wanting to read until the consummation of events in the final chapter.Finally, I find Lewis' injection of not only Merlin but also Arthurian mythology to be not only out of place but also a positive distraction from the Christian meaning and symbolism of the rest of the novel. It's almost as if Lewis, being the classical and medieval scholar he was, couldn't help himself. It makes for fascinating reading, but it's not entirely favorable in its effect.In spite of a few odd things I didn't care for, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" remains a wonder and delight that I highly recommend to serious readers, especially those who are Christian."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"C. S. Lewis - THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTHTHS is the third installment in his Space Trilogy. For those who have read the previous two novels (though this is self-contained enough to read as a stand-alone work), they will find themselves introduced to a whole new series of characters, some devilish, some not.The first time I've heard of the trilogy, it was from a pastor's wife. I was only then reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS (this was back in 1994), and I decided I would try it. Being a fan of Narnia (although I do not like Lion nearly as much as the others), I figured this would be good also.THAT HIDEOUS STRENGHT, which is longer than the other two books combined, is a book like no other I've read. Everytime I read it I get something new, and, even though I don't much care for the Arthurian element in the story, this is probably my favorite of all of Lewis's fiction, even though he has better (TILL WE HAVE FACES). The novel is reach in characters and ideas (sometimes too much), and I've never read anything else that gives me the same feeling or experience that I get when I read this novel. This is among my top three that I most often return too of Lewis's fiction. Anyway, on to the review.Lewis, in finishing up this Space Trilogy, presents us with the most complex novel in the series. Lewis reaches for and touches on so many different themes and social concerns throughout the course of the novel, it is impressive on the range of his thought. This book can be the most difficult of the three (although its still highly readable), because so much is going on, and it has been harshly criticized for the amount of material Lewis tried (unsuccessfully, some would argue) to cover in voicing his own social concerns.Another interesting element of the novel is its relationship to Middle-earth. Lewis makes it quite clear in the novel when he brings in element's of Tolkien's mythology that he is setting his universe in the same imagined space that Tolkien's occurs in. Lewis specifically mentions Middle-earth several times in the novel, and brings in Numenor (a misspelling of Numenor). A careful reading shows THS may be the very first case of fanfiction ever for Tolkien, a full eight years before LOTR was published (though Lewis knew the at that time unfinished work quite well when he was writing THS).Before we get started you should now more about the novel's genre, as the Space Trilogy is commonly classified as SF. As far as science fiction goes, there are some elements of SF present in THS, but Lewis calls it a fairy tale for a reason - this isn't really science fiction, not the kind you'd find Asimov or Heinline or Clarke. This more mythic than anything, much like PERELANDRA (read my review for my thoughts on that novel), and not really SF-based at all.The novel is about the corruption of men and women, and how two sides, one good, one evil, are trying to capture Britain. The novel focuses primarily on two journeys taken by a husband and wife.The main characters are Mark and Jane Studdock, a modern couple who are lost to God and to each other. Jane begins having dreams that are visions of events that are really happening, and ultimately goes to meet with Elwin Ransom about the issue. Meanwhile Mark, a fellow at a college, gets a new employment opportunity with the N. I. C. E. (National Institute for Coordinator Experiments), and so starts his journey into their hellish world. The NICE is ultimately a satanic organization, and appears very much an Orwellian creation. They are trying to take over the government, have their own police force, and control the presses. The N. I. C. E. would be something Orwell would write if he were Christian. Ultimately we find out they are trying have taken the head of a dead criminal, imbibed it with life, and have given themselves over to satanic forces. The Head is demonically possessed. It is through this demonic possession that Satan gives orders to the heads of the NICE. This strength that the NICE as is what the title refers to. The title is drawn from a medival poem about Babel, which also fits in quite nicely as at the novel's climax God confuses men's speech.The opposing forces, lead by Ransom, is the perfect counter picture to the NICE. There is a love for all things that grow and give life. They are a small group of people waiting for directions from Ransom's superiors (God and angels) to begin combat with the NICE. There are several charming and endearing characters on Ransom's side, including Dr. Dimble (a old don who is married but has no children), and MacPhee, a non-Christian whose function is to be the Skeptic.The main action of the novel follows Jane and Mark moving about in their new circles. Ultimately we find out both have been trying to get to Jane, which is why the NICE wants Mark in the first place. She is a dreamer, and so she may be able to find Merlin, who has been swept out of time for the last fifteen hundred years. Both sides assume Merlin will be on their side. When Ransom's group finally finds Merlin first, turns out Merlin is Christian.Once Merlin arrives, the waiting that Ransom's group has been doing for most of the novel is at long last completed. The time for action has come. Ultimately Merlin himself descends upon the NICE, and in one of the most bloody and gruesome scenes in modern literature Merlin eradicates NICE. Animals that were being experimented on by the Institute also escape and join in the carnage.At the end of the novel, Mark and Jane are reunited, and the gods descend upon St. Anne's (the house Ransom's group are at) and carry Ransom away. The ending is very much a celebration of sacred Christian sexuality, and the novel closes as Mark and Jane are together in a bridal chamber they have been preparing. Lewis's intention for the two characters is they obviously make love, and in all likelihood get pregnant that night.The third book, THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH, is longer that the first two combined. In Sayer's biography (I think it's Sayer - if not its in the Green-Hooper biography) a statement is made that THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is a Charles Williams novel written by C. S. Lewis, and having reading some Williams I now see why they say that. Tolkien felt William's influence spoiled it, with too much Arthurian mythology incorporated into it. I'm personally not a big fan of King Arthur stories, but this does give me a broader appreciation for them. Many readers may wonder why both sides have such an intense desire to obtain Merlin. Lewis assumes too much knowledge of the reader here. According to legend Merlin is an incubus, a child without a father.THS may very well be the best of the trilogy, but there are several weaknesses in it.1. For one, much of the novel is spent in realistic settings. Though we are naturally horrified by the NICE, we don't want them so brutally killed as they are at the end of this book. Its main weakness is it jumps from modern to mythical too soon. It is a novel of ideas, and then at the climax the story becomes mythical, with a violent ending.2. Another topic that concerns critics is Lewis's use of violence in THS. Lewis was invoking Dante throughout, but the real problem, as Downing says in PLANETS IN PERIL, that the transition between the modern satirical novel and that of mythology occurs too quickly here. Another fault THS has is the flat villains who can only be bad, and on the good side some of the characters have the same fault.3. Lewis assumes to much of the readers on the matter of Merlin. Unless your familiar with Merlin, you will not know why both sides are so keen to obtain him. Merlin was an incubus, and had no father. That being the case, both sides thing Merlin is something similar to an eldil, or angel, and for both sides he would be a powerful addition to their forces. Ransom is also concerned if the other side captures him they will never find Merlin, and if Merlin is not Christian, Merlin doesn't know how to contend with him, but knows he must4. In the OSP and PERELANDRA, Ransom is an engaging, though flawed, human, a person the average reader can really relate too. In THS though, he is much more distant. He's never as accessibly human in THS as he was in the other installments. Ransom never seems fully realised as a character as he did in the previous two novels. Ransom becomes much more idealised, whereas in the two previous books Ransom was just like the average sincere Christian man, with struggles and faults. Now, he is the leader and seems to be beyond reproach.After citing these faults, please do not come to the conclusion I do not like THS; far from that actually. This is my personal favorite of the three, despite the perceived faults.This is highly recommended. It's notable this is one of Lewis's best selling works - despite the previously cited criticisms, this is Lewis at the top of his game. And what a game it is!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"When I first read That Hideous Strength, I was too young to understand many of the themes presented, and in trying to enjoy it as simply a story, I finished it feeling confused. When I returned to it a couple years later, I found it incredibly in-depth and rich with wonderful themes, tying in earlier references from Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra as it built up to one grand conclusion.This is NOT a light read, but if you have the patience to read slowly and savor each nuance, it is well worth it. It requires the same reading style that true fans of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy develop in order to absorb the masterful work properly.I would not recommend this book to anyone younger than late teenage years or older, as many youth are not prepared to deal with the themes (that Lewis presents) in a matter-of-fact way, and are more likely to react strongly to dated attitudes towards women (sadly, many readers do remain that way even as they chronologically age). More mature readers are able to look past those as typical of the times in which Lewis lived, and learn from his full story, which is an excellent lesson for us all."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is my 2nd favorite fiction ever, right after Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. &quot;Hideous&quot; is brilliant because it combines a pragmatic look at evil people and diabolical conspiracies with a wit and humor that keeps me laughing on almost every page.And in classic Lewis style, interwoven everywhere are religious allegories and symbolism. This book is a treat, like a creamsicle on a summer afternoon.I was confused at the beginning since the story seems to suddenly break from the 1st two in the trilogy, both in storyline, and in the fact that there seems to be no science fiction in Hideous. But everything becomes clear later on, and the trilogy is truly continued.This may become known as the most undiscovered book of the 20th century, but it's a classic and a literary jewel."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This was a wonderful classic that I discovered! It can be read by adults and older kids (teens). C.S. Lewis is a master!"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis brings his space trilogy back to the planet Earth for this final installment. Since Ransom is back on earth, the tone of the book loses the \\"fantastic\\" nature of the previous two novels. However, Lewis's main theme is still the same: good in its battle against evil. Here evil initially takes more recognizable forms before growing into more extreme forms (I don't want to give anything away). He warns against many forms of evil that were then just beginning to appear but have now reached fruition. Though Lewis obviously has a passionate agenda (what great writer doesn't?), he doesn't lose the narrative. It is again an original novel and a horrifying vision of what evil is capable of and how good must find the courage to oppose evil."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I raved about the first 2 books of this trilogy. I can't about the last.Lewis makes a very significant change in his voice and approach here in the final book of his \\"Space Trilogy.\\" Knowing some of the history of its writing, this is in large part due to his closer association with and the influence of the fellow author and member of \\"The Inklings,\\" George MacDonald.MacDonald's influence upon Lewis is evidenced by this book being much darker and much less connected to the theme of the first 2 books. It's almost like watching Lewis trying to do a literary exercise.Still excellent writing and worth the read, but when I read the work I found the feeling to be much more heavy and dark. Even the change in character focus contributes toward the feeling of discontinuity.That having been said, Lewis very much hits the mark with the ethical and philosophical conundrums that have multiplied and confounded our modern era. It is almost prophetic how the biological ethical issues of today are foreseen and portrayed in a book written in 1945.Yes some of it can be explained by the context of the times in which it was written (WWII) and the darker influence of the melancholic MacDonald, but some of it comes from the nature of the material and logical progression as Lewis begins to deal not with fantasy worlds, but our own world and all of its far too evident foibles.Ironic too is the focus upon the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments (NICE). Echoes of Orwell abound.Do not come to this work expecting more of Ransom and company. This work feels disconnected from the others. \\"Bent,\\" if you will. Once you get over that and begin to read and digest the very meaningful portrayals of our future world through Lewis' eyes, you will have a fresh appreciation of his unique voice and writing skills.A very satisfying and worthwhile read. Not quite a rave review, but certainly an endorsement."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The third book was a disappointment. I was expecting something completely different. The first part of the book was introducing people who weren't in the first two books and I had a hard time following who was who and how they fit in with the folks in the other two books. I wasn't able to figure out who this odd character was with the bleeding foot or if he was a main character or not until he was called by another name somewhere in the middle of the book. But I am sure the folks that like mysteries, would figure this out rather quickly. Anyway, this was not my style of book."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Lewis, like his friend and fellow philologist Tolkien, dealt in the creation of realistic myth. This well paced novel culminates his Space Trilogy, commencing with Out of the Silent Planet and continuing with Perelandra, based on the theme of natural and beneficial order versus the illusion of unchecked, destructive \\"human progress.\\"While one may take objection to many of Lewis's ideas on religion - I myself do - the unseen world of the eldils, or angels - both good and bad - that he constructs is so grandiose and fascinating that I for one forgive him all offences.The story opens quietly in a small English town, where a modern young woman - modern for 1945 that is - endures the frustrations of marriage to an underpaid fellow of a minor university. From this innocent beginning, the pair become entrapped by the machinery of a satanic group bent on world domination.Step by step they are enticed into a satanic plan for world domination, yet, while the plot snares them with all the devilish menace that a reader could wish for, its grasp on their lives is achieved by everyday, believable manipulations: the threatened loss of employment, the flattery of recognition, the temptation of money, power and fame. Eventually the Satanists overreach themselves, and the novel culminates in an imaginative battle of good and evil, with both spiritual and brute physical forces on either side.The writer George Orwell argues that the inevitable triumph of good over evil weakens the novel, but I don't agree. To me, its charm lies not in its ending but in the skill with which the story is told. It says much for this story, that though science has overtaken it during passage of half a century and more, its lives as though written today.I particularly enjoy Lewis's construction of opposed hierarchies, and the subtlety with which both good and bad characters are drawn. But how remarkable it is that we are often drawn more to the bad characters! My favourite amongst these is Wither, an ancient villain, whose massive but crumbling intellect hides behind a faade of amiable vagueness as he schemes his way towards ultimate power.Ending on this note, is it not strange and intriguing that a strong Christian apologist like professor Lewis should need to spice his calm beliefs with garnishes of magic, naturism and warlike demigods?"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"That Hideous Strength. That power of evil that desires to bring everything into submission to it. That draws men in to it, until they will have nothing else.In this fantastic close to C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, we continue to follow the activities of Ransom, as he and his friends fight a spiritual battle against the forces of evil. This time, the battle is on Earth, were a new organization, the National Institute of Coordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E), consults with demons through a terrible creature, and snakes its tentacles of influence into every aspect of England --- politics, religion, history, education, justice, and science --- all in the name of a better world. It also follows the struggles of a recently married couple, Mark and Jane Studdock, as Mark goes into the employ of N.I.C.E., and Jane joins the resistance.This climactic book follows in the tradition of its predecessors(Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra), as it describes everyday occasions and phenomenal events with perfect imagery and cunning wit. You will be left wishing for more, and yet at the same time find yourself grateful that C.S. Lewis chose to give us a concise, refined, and matchless series in the Space Trilogy.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Perhaps not the BEST of C. S. Lewis' works, but a good one nonetheless. I was introduced to the 'space trilogy' as a teenager by my father, a minister. He thought I would enjoy the SciFi aspect and maybe glean some ethical education in the meantime. He was correct. This was not the most fun of the trilogy to read, but a good ending to the trilogy. If you are looking for classic SciFi with good moral values, the 'space trilogy' is definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The masterful culmination of the Space Trilogy, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" will certainly raise the ire of feminists and moral relativists alike. They should read it anyway.Other reviewers have complained that \\"That Hideous Strength\\" doesn't seem to fit with the first two books of the trilogy. It's true that the plot of the third book is more complex, with far more characters, than the first two. Ransom, the hero of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra,\\" does play a smaller role in this book. But the trilogy isn't about Ransom. It's about good vs. evil, humility vs. pride, obedience, rebellion, and a whole host of other light-dark juxtapositions. For this reason, readers who enjoyed the first two books from a purely science fiction standpoint, may be disappointed that they don't get to see more of Ransom.The real reason to read \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is for the seed of Christian philosophy embedded in it. The apparently \\"anti-womyn\\" theme so distasteful to zealous feminists is not degrading or insulting to women at all. Though one of the female protagonists, Jane, is instructed to \\"go [to her husband] in obedience, and you will find love,\\" there is nothing misogynistic or sexist about the plot. The theme of obedience (both the good kind and the bad kind) runs strong through this book, and is applied to both male and female characters. One of the more interesting ideas to chew on is the difference between the good obedience, and the bad obedience. Members of Ransom's household obey him, and he in turn obeys Maleldil. The exercise of free will is made clear in these relationships, which are good. But the obedience of Professor Frost and Deputy Director Wither of the New-World-Order-esque N.I.C.E. to dark spirits, and the obedience of other N.I.C.E. employees to them, is clearly obedience gone bad.This book is the stuff of many high school and college English theme papers. But that's not to say it can't be enjoyed for simply being a good fantasy tale. It's that, too."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"For the first half, at least, it is an absorbing look at the lure of power and the ever-unfolding &quot;Inner Ring&quot; (see that essay in the Weight of Glory compilation). Wither in particular is a chilling entity, one of the great characterizations. The novel lost me later on when it explained too much about Belbury, and then simultaneously confused me with the (far) less interesting goings on at St. Anne's. Here is a novel crying out to be excised and adapted into a great film, but alas, who is out there to film it? Speaking generally, Hollywood is unqualified to do anything but make a mess of it."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I adore C.S. Lewis so much... so it pains me to say that I really, really disliked this book. The first time I attempted reading it, I got 90-something pages in, and then stopped. On my second attempt, I made it all the way through the 382 pages in about three weeks' time (that is a LONG time for me). For one, it was just boring. All of the fantastic imagination and vivid imagery from the first two books was non-existent in That Hideous Strength. It was like watching black-and-white TV. Secondly, I cared nothing for any of the characters. Not even Ransom. They were all dull and very wordy without saying much of anything at all. It was also quite a bit darker than the other two books, and many of the antagonists met gruesome ends. The allegory/theology/philosophy was also very difficult to follow. Of course I got the picture of the battle of good and evil, but as to the specifics, I don't have a clue."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"Taken by itself - which can be done without much issue - this is a good book. However, when positioned as the third installment of the Space Trilogy, it is a square peg being placed in a round hole. There are a number of things about this book that break the harmony with Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra.1. Dr. Ransom is not the central figure of the story. There are vague references to him earlier in the book, but it is at almost the halfway point that we see Ransom interact with the rest of the characters. Some may find this similar to the way The Two Towers is written, but the big difference between the two is that all but one of the characters in The Hideous Strength are brand new. Even Devine is going by a different name. At least in The Two Towers, you were reading about familiar characters for the first half.2. The number of characters in this story is significantly large in comparison to the other two books in the trilogy. You meet as many characters in Bracton alone as you see in the entire length of Perelandra. That doesn't even take into consideration the characters at Logres and the N.I.C.E. This seems to take away from the cohesiveness of the Trilogy and almost detaches it from the other two stories.3. The role of the Oyarsa is quite different. Given that the story is set on Earth, this is somewhat expected. However, never having them speak just doesn't seem fair after their involvement in the other two stories. Lewis should have let the Oyarsa from Mercury and Saturn impart wisdom as Mars and Venus did.Again, this *is* a good book if you take it by itself. There are even some things related about the differences between men and women that are quite funny but true. Look for MacPhee's comparison of how the two sexes use nouns. Married people will get a chuckle. However, given that this is supposed to conclude a trilogy, it really fails in that regard. If you are expecting something that performs like Return of the King, you will be quite disappointed."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"I am a huge fan of most of C.S.

I was disappointed there was no closure to the story. Lewis makes mincemeat of our feeble minds. His insights are amazing and his concept of the world beyond is exquisite. The English dialect can be slightly aggravating.The novel is centered around a university now owned and run by a group of intellectuals set out to change the world by the creation of a \\"new man\\". They created this new world order front to rid the world of undesirables, evoke a revolution upon the earth, and enforce a police state.

I really enjoyed That Hideous Strength, but it's almost impossible to explain how well it was written. It will sound a bit farfetched from my descriptions, but somehow it keeps all its varying aspects perfectly blended into the story.Overall it is an engaging fantasy mingling with sci-fi. It tells the story of a young couple who are caught between good and evil. On the side of good is the old-fashioned England, the spirits of the deep heavens, and characters like Mr. Bultitude and Ivy Maggs that charm and delight. McPhee is hilarious while Ramson himself is wise and yet human. On the side of evil there is the movement towards 'social progress' with characters like Frost and Withers that fascinate with their perverse logic. Lord Feverstone is a familiar smiling bastard while The Fairy is repulsive and pitiful.Caught between these are Jane and Mark, the pragmatic newly married couple whose failure in love provides interesting fodder in and of itself. It covers the moral aspects of forward progress really well, the old-fashioned English village with all its quirks is pitted against the facist social purity of labratory and government merged. Then add an appearance by Merlyn and old magic, giving it an interesting Arthurian slant I've never seen done before.I admit that a few of the essay-style conversations about morality were wordy, but I loved this book.

I only wish they were available for Kindle! (or iBooks :)"},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"The final book in the \\"Space Trilogy\\" is by far the longest, and has had the greatest lasting effect on society. That said, it was probably my least favorite of the three novels.That Hideous Strength, which takes its name from a 16th century poem about the Tower of Babel (this comes into play in the story's final moments), can be evaluated in two ways: its influence, and the story itself.There is no doubt that this has been an influential book. Along with The Abolition of Man, a non-fiction book written by Lewis in 1943 (two years prior to That Hideous Strength), this book addresses a reductionist, science-based understanding of humanity and the decreasing acceptance of an objective moral standard. Lewis felt very strongly about the issues he'd presented in the essays compiled in Abolition, but felt that literature was a more effective way of disseminating his own views.The antagonists in the story are a secret society with influence throughout British society, from politics to education to media to religion. They even have their own private army/police force. This group (called the National Institute of Co-ordinated Experiments, or \\"N.I.C.E.\\") believes that mankind must take charge of its own evolution, and that through scientific means, can determine what it means to actually be human. Through subversive means (primarily through control of the media) the N.I.C.E. aims to bend England, and eventually the rest of the planet, to its own worldview.This presents a dystopian view of the future, which has been seen by many readers as a distinct possibility in reality. There are people and organizations with those motives (though perhaps not the exact method of seeing them through). They have largely gained control of the media and educational institutions. The result has been a loss of \\"faith\\" in objective moral standards in society-at-large. For these reasons, That Hideous Strength has been seen as somewhat \\"prophetic\\", much in the same way as other novels written by some of Lewis' contemporaries, such as Orwell's 1984 and Rand's Atlas Shrugged.While I agree with the Christian worldview which tinted Lewis' novels far more than I agree with the worldviews of atheists such as Orwell and Rand, I thought that the supernatural elements of That Hideous Strength actually detracted from the story. The story is obviously a fantasy (the book is subtitled \\"A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grownups\\"), but Lewis' depiction of angelic beings and mythical creatures seemed an awkward addition to an otherwise very realistic depiction of a (then) near-future England.I certainly believe that spiritual warfare plays a more significant role in day-to-day events than most people realize, but I found the combination of mystery/intrigue with medieval and mythological characters a bit confusing at times. Personally, I think that Lewis could have communicated his point better had he chosen to focus more on either the fantastic or the realistic elements, rather than juxtaposing them to the extent that he did. In this regard, I am in agreement with George Orwell himself, who reviewed That Hideous Strength in 1945. You can find that review online.However, I also agree with Orwell that, on the whole, this is a tremendous book, and worthy of recommendation."},{"Title":"That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-ups","review":"This is the end of the trilogy, for the first time entirely on earth. It is a fun story of earthy corruption, with lots of Christian details, and some surprise figures like Merlin. But ultimately, it is a good story that does not do much really new. So if you are a fan of Lewis, which I am, it is a pleasure to reach the end. What really distinguishes this is the elegant writing. Lewis was a master of prose and theme. But I did enjoy the first two much much more as path-breaking if amateur scifi.Recommended for fans. They will not be disappointed.

It charts the migration of horses in America and dispels a lot of the Old West myths that we've been fed in children's books and Hollywood movies. The references to actual Spanish, German, Dutch, French and English documents that reveal how, when and where horses were brought to America is amazing. Kudos for Dr. Bennett undertaking this onerous task to bring actual facts to light and to increase the knowledge of horse lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship","review":"Happily, I bought my copy of this pretentious and poorly done book as a (cheap) library discard. Most libraries discard only dated books. This one is copyrighted 1998, so it is hardly \\"old\\", so one can only assume it was either of little interest or deemed not worth keeping on the shelves. I'd be kicking myself still if I'd paid the cover price of $49.95. (You can buy my copy from me as soon as I list it on eBay, if you wish!) Why the bad review, you ask? Oh, several reasons...beginning with the lengthy quotations in Spanish inserted into the Introduction. Not all of us are fluent in Spanish, nor do we care to be. Note to the author: translate the quotations you use rather than trying to impress us with your erudition! (Maybe I should write this review in Russian in retaliation.) The writing is belabored. I quote: \\"Scenario: The Encounter. A mare miraculously lifts herself, gasping, after a fall that should have spent her.\\" (Spent? Is she a coin?). \\"The hunter who spies her is exhausted himself from the stalk and the rush to drive the frenzied herd over the cliff. He turns away, perhaps because he does not want to face nearly ten times his weight in rolling red eyes and flashing teeth.\\" Even Jean Auel at her worst is better than this. Moving on...please understand that one CANNOT make assumptions on horse conformation or gaits based on ancient artwork! Remember, until photography revealed that galloping horses did not extend all four legs at once, depictions of this gait were incorrect, to say the least. To look at a wall painting from Pompeii and state that the \\"fiery chestnut goes forward at a fast amble\\" is pure hogwash, regardless of your credentials! The same thing goes for assigning meanings to prehistoric art. Not every artist of old (or even today) is capable of accuracy. They draw and sculpt to the best of what is most often very limited abilities. There is no way a rational person would be able to prove that Figure 2.2 on page 16 depicts mankind's first methods of trapping and controlling mares. Give us a break! I can't resist pointing out that there is a major error in the \\"reconstruction\\" of a Numidian cavalryman on page 75. Overall, the drawings in the book show a lot of effort, but their usefulness and quality fall short of what should be expected for a relatively expensive tome. Perhaps I am too critical, but I do have high standards as regards books that are added to my collection. This one fails to make the grade."},{"Title":"Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship","review":"It is quite possible that this book has a lot to teach me beneath the stream of consciousness style but it sure is a lot of hard work trying to dig out those old-fashioned subjects, verbs and objects from beneath the flower-power new age sentencing that is perhaps a misguided attempt to bring color to her subject but more likely just linguistic self-indulgence and a lack of willpower to rein in the runaway sentences and lassoo the flyaway metaphors that keep on buzzing out of Pandora's beehive."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Script Book, Season 2, Vol. 3","review":"&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Script Book, Season Two, Volume 3&quot; begins the Angelus story arc that dominated that spectaular sophomore season (episodes 13-17). Having a copy of the scripts in hands really puts the final touches on your enjoyment of these episodes and not just because you can find differences between what is in the final shooting script and what got aired on television, but also because you get to see the stage directions that Joss Whedon and the other writers have put in as well:&quot;Surprise,&quot; written by Marti Noxon, begins with Buffy having nightmares about Angel getting dusted and ends with her celebrating her birthday in a way that gives her vampire with a soul boyfriend a moment of true happiness that has horrible consequences. We discover these in &quot;Innocence,&quot; written by Whedon, where Angeleus takes over the attempt to raise the Judge from Spike and Dru. &quot;Phases,&quot; written by Rob DesHotel and Dean Batali, takes time out from the Angelus threat for Oz to discover that he has been transformed into a werewolf after being bit by his nephew. Then there is the comic relief of Marti Noxon's &quot;Bewitched, Bothered &amp; Bewildered,&quot; in which Cordelia breaks up with Xander--on Valentine's Day no less--and he responds by getting Amy the witch to work a love spell, with results pretty much the complete opposite of what he intended.That distraction only heightens the pathos of &quot;Passion,&quot; written by Ty King, in which Angelus kills Jenny Calendar and finally succeeds in convincing Buffy that the vampire she loves has to die. The conclusion of the Angelus story arc and Season 2 of &quot;BtVS&quot; turns out to be even more painful as the show becomes absolutely operatic."},{"Title":"The Carnival Handbook","review":"I have looked at this book from a law enforcement perspective. Some of the games mentioned are crooked or gambling games. I inspect carnival games and teach this to other cops. If I came upon some of the games mentioned for the different events, someone would go to jail for gambling and fraudulent operations. On the other hand, this does show one how to set up such an event for your fundraiser. I would hope that those who follow this advice ask law enforcement which games should be played and which they should shy away from."},{"Title":"The Carnival Handbook","review":"I'm the owner of a party rental business, and this book is a god-send for my customers who've been thrown into the position of running their own school or church fund-raiser.

Still, I found this book to be an excellent resource for those who have a singular question regarding syntax rules or for those who are lacking in these skills. You do not have to use the system of codes for referring to the rules, as each subject is listed by the precise rule discussed. There is a section on commas, periods, correct use of verbs,correct word choice, and so much more. It is a complete concise reference book and is more than the average person needs to improve or begin his venture into the wonderful word of proper syntax or writng. Of course, for more advanced or scholarly treatises, a compendium would be needed, and still, this is an excellent jumping off place. I found myself reading the book as though it were a novel I could not put down. I studied Latin in high school and was a student of the old time Catholic grammar schools where grammar was taught from kindergarten through high school using the old system of diagrams. The problem I see today is that the teaching of grammar rules is delayed, and should be taught from day one of mandatory education and continued through college to refine and preserve those skills. I hear and see the destruction of the English language from every level of society. Graduates from the top schools in the country, writers, journalists, commentators, judges, politicians, and the average person defy the laws of grammar and writing from simple basic English to more advanced usage. The reintroduction of our language into the classroom would serve as a foreign language equivalent well worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Composition Handbook","review":"Merriss' and Griswold's Composition Handbook has been around for many years. It is a fine tool to use in composition classes in grades 8 through 12. The book gives rules and shows the student an example of a correct usage and often an incorrect one. The book is ideal for revising papers, which, as most English teachers know, is when much of the learning of correct writing occurs. The book takes a little while for an instructor to learn, because the various grammar rules are referred to by a system of numbers and letters. However, it is very thorough and straightforward. Students are not likely to get confused if they just follow the system. And it works!For more advanced students (and adults)I would recommend Pearlman's and Pearlman's &quot;Guide to Rapid Revision.&quot;"},{"Title":"Family Feeling","review":"This is a fairly standard romance set in the \\"romantic\\" coal fields of Northern Wales. The 3 main characters are linked either by blood common passion, and this should make for a more interesting story, but alas, it is entirely predictible.What is of interest is that in my copy, Dot's father has a mistress called Edie, and thus she is called for at least two thirds of the book, when she is suddenly referred to as Blanche. I had to re-read a few pages to ensure that she was indeed one and the same character. Poor editing perhaps? Either way, it doesn't make the book any more interesting.It is certainly an entertaining enough read for lovers of the genre, but if you're looking for a far more spectacular book on the life and times of the hardy and brave men who worked the mines, and the women who loved them, try \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" by Richard Llewellyn."},{"Title":"The Value of Science: Essential Writings of Henri Poincare (Modern Library Science)","review":"Some historical figures are known to all cultured persons. LeoTolstoy, Johannes Brahms, Vincent Van Gogh -- these are names ofwhich most of us would be embarrassed to be ignorant. On theother hand, few of us would think to add the name of Jules HenriPoincare to this list; and yet, if we did, it would tower overall the rest. For Poincare was a mathematician of the veryhighest rank, an astonishingly fertile creative genius whoseprescient insight and technical mastery utterly transformed theart to which he devoted his life. Among his predecessors in thethree-thousand-year history of mathematics, only Archimedes,Newton, Euler, and Gauss can be said to have equalled orexceeded him. By any standard, Poincare was one of the trulygreat.If for no other reason than this, THE VALUE OF SCIENCE is wellworth reading. It is, after all, quite rare to find a book thatcollects the thoughts of one of the very few genuinely profoundintellects in human history. But what makes THE VALUE OFSCIENCE truly wonderful is that it is not merely worth reading:it is, in fact, a joy to read. For in addition to his uncannymathematical gifts, Poincare had the knack of expressinghimself beautifully in writing. Even in translation, his prosehas an admirable lucidity and grace, and his aphoristic styleoften makes him highly quotable. When he speaks of mathematicalcreation, as he does in a celebrated essay of that name, heoffers general readers a fascinating glimpse into the depthsof his own extraordinary mind at the peak of its imaginativefrenzy; his (scrupulously non-technical) account of one of hisgreatest mathematical discoveries supplies an unforgettableintellectual thrill, a sort of electric shock for the soul. Foranyone interested in the psychology of creation, this is simplyirresistible stuff.A final brief caveat: although Poincare was clearly the greatestmathematician of his time, he was not the greatest physicist. Acurious wrong-headedness kept him from beating Albert Einsteinto the creation of special relativity, and general relativityeventually proved Poincare wrong in some of his opinions on therelation between physics and geometry. So when Poincare speaksof physics, bear in mind that some of his positions no longerseem really tenable.But this is no reason not to read every word of THE VALUE OFSCIENCE. It's a marvelous book, and its author was a marvelousman. Get to know them both. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Value of Science: Essential Writings of Henri Poincare (Modern Library Science)","review":"In a first reading of \\"THE VALUE OF SCIENCE\\", it may look like that Poincar&eacute; works' main contribution was to expose the science in XIX. But looking further the surface, you can realize his great influence in the work of important scientists from the last century (i.e. Einstein, Heisenberg and Bohr, for instance). In \\"THE VALUE OF SCIENCE\\" and \\"SCIENCE AND HYPOTHESIS\\" there are lots of insights about Relativity, Uncertainty Principle, Correspondence Principle, Mathematics Incompleteness, etc. If in one hand we have that Poincar&eacute; approached lots of genius questions and his answers are no longer seen as right, on the other hand, as himself have said, some mathematicians let themselves be guided by intuition, making some quick achievements, even insecure ones, as if they are daring knights in the front line.Poincar&eacute; is not just the greatest science philosopher of all times ever and an outstanding genius as a mathematician and a mathematical physicist, he was also elected to the Acad&eacute;mie Francaise in 1909, what is a proof that reading \\"THE VALUE OF SCIENCE\\" is a delighted and funny duty."},{"Title":"The Value of Science: Essential Writings of Henri Poincare (Modern Library Science)","review":"How many books on science and math have you read and said: \\"I just couldn't put it down.

Here we can find something of what Poincar&eacute; wrote for the general (albeit educated) public.

But no matter which of his books you connect with, it will become an addiction.After a few chapters you will find a sentence which you have seen before, and it is because Poincare is often quoted, but rarely cited. While these writings are over 100 years old, the questions he asks of himself and the reader are just as relevent today. In Science and Method he makes the argument that science for the sake of science has more value than science for the sake of business. And that even research which disproves a hypothesis has value, because the process of the scientific method will in itself yield a benefit they may not be apparent at the time.And the really profound part is that discovery simply for the sake of commerce has very little benefit on society as a whole, since it is not shared with other researchers.I am doing a poor job of paraphrasing, but you get the point.His writing style is an easy read even today.Well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Value of Science: Essential Writings of Henri Poincare (Modern Library Science)","review":"This volume is a handy collection of three of the most important books he wrote for general consumption.

She also does a great job explaining the characters she takes on in her quest to get a meal without the servers, chefs, etc knowing that it's her (she's a restaurant critic for the NY Times). This is an interesting look at something I had no idea about."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This is the third installment that Ruth Reichl shares about her life. This book follows her as she becomes the NY Times restaurant critic.While flying to NY to start the job she realizes that she's going to be recognized and must come up with a plan to eat out and not be treated as the NY Times restaurant critic. So she comes up with the fabulous idea of transforming herself into different people. She enlists help from her mother's friend and \\"becomes\\" her characters. She finds out that when she dresses up as these characters -- that she has within her to be that person as well. She even becomes jealous of some of her characters (Brenda) and despises others (Emily). It's such a great learning experience for her that I wish more people could do it as well.This is fun to read and if you're not hungry starting out -- you'll definitely be by page 20. I love that instead of using pictures, she uses recipes to further illustrate her love and passion for food. It's as if you're at dinner with your best friend who's sharing every bite of food with you.I read her past two books, Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples and thoroughly enjoyed them as well. I am eagerly awaiting her next book about her experiences as editor-in-chief of Gourmet. I'm going to have a dinner group -- where everyone has to read at least one of her books and bring one of her recipes. I highly recommend Ruth Reichl as an author. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Aside from the endless foie gras and wine lists, the author described what happened to her with each disguise. We could see how they influenced her. Each personna seemed to have it's own set of traits, as we humans do have many good ones; some bad. This author seemed to learn and evolve- or go back, from her many uncomfortable disguises to a wonderful personality she had to begin with.My pity is for the Betty's of the world; shoved into corners and rudely treated even though they have the one-time, exhorbitant monies to pay for the spectacular meal of their lives.The author showed me this, and showed me deep concern for the Homeless. While we feast on the World's Bounty, the author addressed a growing concern!!!There's always our Mother in the background, isn't there? Whether ghost or alive, she is always there forcing dialogue or memory in some way, whether we like it or not. Few of us can escape it. Authors especially. I didn't appreciate the author's telling of her mother's shortcomings. Disloyal. We didn't need to know her mother made people sick with her food. Let that be buried with her and go on, picking out instead, her attributes. For as she goes, the descendant will also.I especially enjoyed a peek into the author's life, her friends and the wonderful food that I might only read about. It was so very nice to be treated to a glimpse of her little boy and his own take on life as well as her husband's. I especially loved Carol and felt grief over her demise.Each character the author took on, gave her greater understanding about herself, as I gleaned from the pages. Not all of it good, but all of it enlightening.I paid attention when her husband stated his concerns as Marion did as well. The author admitted this with brutal honesty, describing the critique well, and went into a soul-searching. A good person to begin with, she saw what was happening to her and fixed it; Hurray!The author is quite generous, exhibited a good sense of fair play and a conscience!Enjoyable book. A woman evolving. Great food. Nice recipes. Sharing of grief, friendships, and honesty. She took us along the way.The author shared with us, her innermost ideas, feelings and personal growth. I recommend this book to anyone whether or not we have the means to dine so well as the author."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"As a person who loved Ms. Reichl's previous two books, I even pre-orederd this new one just to find out that it was far below my expectations. I really expected much more from such a talented person who knows the industry inside out and writes prose wonderfully. This book turned out to be a tedious story about changing wigs, fake names, clothes plus some old restaurant reviews. Hence, to delete the not so good impact of this last book on my memories, I went back to reread 'Comfort me with apples' so that I remember Reichl's prose as a much more delightful creation. Nevertheless, I will still read whatever she will write in the future and will look forward to her next piece."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you're into food and New York you will like this book. Ruth Reichl is funny in this memoir about her times as the New York Times restaurant critic. One of the rules of all serious restaurant critics is to go anonymous, so Ruth describes in her book not only the desguises she wore but the personalities she created for the different characters she became: Brenda, Emily, and even her own mother. Ruth transformed herself not only physically but mentally, sometimes confusing her own self. At the end of the book she discovers she needs to move on, and go back to the kitchen instead of the dining room. Great read, I personally loved this book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I love Ruth's work. Seeing a glimpse into what a restaurant reviewer goes through adds a new dimension to the dining experience. I've experienced some of the the same treatment at restaurants that she describes in this book- lousy treatment by myself as an unknown, being kowtowed to when I go in with somebody \\"important\\".One of the things I enjoyed most was the amount of effort that went into creating her other personas. Anybody can just slap on a wig- it takes real work to become another person altogether.Give this book a read- you'll think twice about what and where you eat!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"About halfway through the book, I started getting bored. Reichl comes up with a persona, creates a disguise, eats at (mostly) fancy restaurants, and then shares her review. The book has no real forward momentum, it's mostly a collection of similar vignettes.I enjoyed her previous two books a lot more, and the tales of food mixed with her personal life and loves was a lot more entertaining. I'm glad she has a good husband and a beloved son, but their presence doesn't make for exciting copy.I am also glad Reichl is using her considerable talents more than she did during her years as a NY Times restaurant critic. It's quite an overrated profession, and gathered into book form did nothing but reinforce how pretentious and excessive these restaurants can be"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"When I heard that this book is the work of a former restaurant critic for the NY Times who found that \\"important\\" restaurant patrons get treated a lot better than ordinary people, I wondered:* Is there anyone over age ten who doesn't know that?* How could you write a whole book about this, and keep it interesting?Ah, but I was in for a pleasant surprise. Though the snobbery of fine restaurants in New York City is as unpleasant as it is commonplace, ordinary folks like me have a champion, and her name is Reichl. I need not have worried about the theme wearing thin, because this book is actually a collection of short stories, all entertaining.Mrs. Reichl is a keen observer and good story teller. She knows that we don't go to fine restaurants just to enjoy the food, and she knows that ill manners or bad service can ruin an otherwise happy occasion. As she says:\\"I did not come here simply to eat. I came for the glamour. I'm willing to pay for the privilege of feeling rich and important for a few small hours. Is that too much to ask? I have come here looking for a dream and it has turned into a nightmare. I feel frumpy and powerless. I may be nobody, but I don't like paying to be humiliated.\\"Restaurant owners and employees will eagerly roll out the red carpet for a NYT restaurant critic, just as they did the time the King of Spain was kept waiting in the bar while she and her party were seated immediately. They recognized her, of course, and knew that a good review in the Times was worth more business than any King could deliver.A lot of people would be happy to wallow in such a privileged role, feeding the ego along with the appetite (and all on an expense account) but not Mrs. Reichl. To find out how regular customers get treated, she contrives a variety of elaborate disguises. And sure enough, if you're just an ordinary man (a la Henry Higgins) you may well wind up on the receiving end of some surprisingly coarse, even insulting, behavior in place of hospitality. But one of the delights of this book is the way Mrs. Reichl brings the villains to justice-and if you have ever been similarly mistreated, even vicarious vengeance is sweet.To say the book is good is not to say it's perfect, however.* Though replete with examples of how bureaucratic, mean-spirited, and self-important NYT managers can be, and though published within two years of the Jayson Blair scandal, Mrs. Reichl clings to her memory of it as \\"the world's greatest newspaper\\". I think she gives them better than they deserve.* She gets carried away with her disguises; making up biographies for the characters, undergoing a personality change to go with them, and on one occasion even let herself get picked up in a bar. It's too much like Bridey Murphy for me.* Her recipes, though quite good, come with instructions bordering on the baroque. For example, hash browns call for \\"waxy\\" potatoes (she means \\"boilers, not bakers\\"), and her chicken must be \\"farm-raised\\". Now, isn't any place that raises chickens a farm by definition? (does she mean free-range?). At any rate, I'd like to be there if she ever walks into Wegman's to ask the greengrocer for \\"waxy potatoes\\", or wants the butcher to tell her whether the chicken was \\"raised on a farm\\".* She tells us to \\"cut the potatoes into 1\\" squares.\\" Does she mean cubes? Impossible. Hash-browns are sliced, but you'd never know it from these instructions.* She describes a visit to a Jamaican neighborhood where the cooking equipment is \\"jerry-rigged\\". That is a malapropism. \\"Jerry-built\\" means shoddily built from inferior materials, and \\"jury-rigged\\" describes a repair contrived from materials at hand to get a ship get back to port. But there is no such thing as \\"jerry- rigged\\". It is like saying \\"fire distinguisher\\" when you mean \\"fire extinguisher\\", and I am surprised her editor never caught it.The New York City restaurant scene would make a proving ground for Thorstein Veblen's theory of Conspicuous Consumption. Take Mr. Shapiro, the food warrior, for example. To be part of this extravagance day-in, day-out for ten years would be enough to corrupt a saint. And yet, Mrs. Reichl seems to have kept her head through it all. Just look at her choice of recipes. She may order petit fois gras a Le Cirque, but in the book she tells us how to make dishes like hash browns, and baked chicken. And even when she chooses something more exotic (like New York cheesecake) she gives us a version that is as easy to make as it is delicious. My hat's off to her."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book is less autobiographical than Reichl's other two books, 'Tender at the Bone' and 'Comfort me with apples.' Nonetheless, this book is a great read and hilarious. Reichl talks about moving from being the restaraunt critic for the LA Times to the NY Times. It is great to read about how she dresses up and goes undercover to see how regular, non-rich people get treated at restaraunts. Great stories and pleasant to read beacuse Reichl has the gift of sounding like your friend and that she is right there telling you what happened to her today."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Although it was entertaining to read about resturants I will never get to eat at, I found the dialogue,style, and story boring.I don't know what I was expecting, but my book club wanted to do this book & I did not enjoy it. Maybe newspaper articles are better."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I've loved all of Ruth Reichl's books, although this one is not quite as compelling as her previous autobiographies. Nevertheless, for fans of her writing, this should not be missed. What I found fascinating was the behind-the-scenes look into the world of the restaurant critic - who knew that this was really the way it worked? It makes you think hard about critics across the board - how can they be objective if they are pandered to this way? (Unless they go out of their way to disguise their identity, like Reichl did.)Her passion for food and her work is another reason to buy this book - the way she lives her life with vigor and purpose is truly inspirational. I am a fan. (But I will still give it 4 out of 5 stars because I didn't quite love this effort as much as prior ones.)"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Here's Ruth Reichl again, at her plain-spoken, truth-telling best.Best? Well, yes. If you've ever lived in a metro area where a food critic doesn't bother with disguise and, in fact, cultivates those he purports to \\"review\\", you've probably wondered whether his experience differed just a teensy bit from yours. Here's proof: it does, wildly.Enter the many faces of Ruth: literal faces made up with the artistry and precision of a theater artist. Restaurants are a kind of theater, after all, and it is fascinating to observe Reichl's various transformations. How she looks literally seems to effect personality changes, body language, facial expressions, the whole person. If you have ever wondered how \\"ordinary folk\\" fare at, say, Tavern on the Green, here's your chance to find out at much less cost than you would (disappointedly) pay on your own.In the background of creatively written reviews lurks the grinding machine of the New York Times. Her descriptions leave one with the sense of having a map to her office, of knowing the way to the special, rarefied atmosphere of celebrations. There are gentle (and not-so-gentle) evocations of various characters so that an underlying thread of the book reads almost like a novel.Front and central, though, is the journey the author takes from Los Angeles to New York and the Times. It is a journey of discovering that her first love continues to be the kitchen, of eating and serving forth her own food. By the end of the book, she has found a way of returning to the kitchen, in a sense, by moving on to Gourmet Magazine.In most memoirs, the recipes usually strike me as throwaways. They are essential neither to the text nor to my recipe shelf. This book, unusually, has earned a place among my cookbooks. The roast chicken recipe and Reichl's comments make the book well worth its price."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I like Ruch Reichl - but this book meaders too much. When you read her actual restaurant reviews - they are superb... however, too much build up when she's not reviewing. Once or twice with the disguises to get into restaurants was enough - after the fourth time - it was redundant - and I was interested in learning more about her views on the whole food industry (than what wig goes with what outfit/make-up and so on for costuming herself to appear in public -so chefs/maitre-d's do not recognize her). That played well once, twice - but after that - it didn't matter anymore... I got the point. Ruth writes very well - and is very down to earth and really knows her food... but I thought better editing could have tightened up her stories and made for smoother flow. I felt this good book - could have been a great book. Ruth has a nice way about her - she takes on the world of high end food and restaurants - and makes it approachable for the average person - in that way, she is excellent."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I first heard about Ruth Reichl's book after hearing her interviewed on CBC Radio. She was talking about the vast difference in the way restaurants would treat her when they recognised her as the New York Times restaurant critic compared to when she went in disguise - and she was encouraging people to stand up for their rights and insist on being well treated when they went out, something that most people don't do.The book is about food and restaurants - but much more than that. It's about the different aspects of your personality that come out when you're someone else, and how life-alterning those experiences can be. From a nondescript, middle aged woman, to a seductive redhead, to an acerbic shrew, Ruth Reichl describes her transformations, how they exposed different parts of herself that she never knew about, and for better or worse, how they changed her.Reichl isn't afraid to say what she thinks of people. At one moment she can be sublimely sensitive and loving towards someone in a way that reminds me of June Callwood at her best, and the next, describing in detail the dinner companion from hell at the top of the World Trade Center. She is also frank about herself - how idealistically she started out, how the job changed her, and what she thought of herself for it.One of the marks of a really good dish is that you discover something fresh about it every time you try it. In the same way, Ruth Reichl tells the same story in each chapter, but each time she reveals a little more about herself.This is one of just a few books I've read recently that made me feel disappointed to find there weren't any pages left at the end."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book set my finely attuned bull**** meter clanging away. When she sticks to her strengths,that is, writing about food, she is an engaging writer. Sadly, this book strays too much into make-believe land. I didn't believe most of the scenarios.Many had the resounding ring of COMPOSITE about them.I don't know---maybe it is because I just saw the film \\"Shattered Glass\\". Most dubious was an episode in which Ms.Reichl conveniently runs into a chic, ultra-sophisticated Hong Kong native who shows her the ropes at a restaurant in Flushing. Too many characters sound made up. Most annoying was Ms.Reichl's foray into pyscho-babble with the 'multiple personalities' that arose from her disguises. Particularly annoying were Brenda Rose and Emily whatever-her-name was (by that point in the book I was fed up with the Six Faces of Ruth). The experiences described in this book, especially, the ending, which I won't give away, are just too pat and convenient to seem like anything but the plot devises of an amateur novelist. I hope for his sake her son is not as cloyingly sweet and goody-goody as he comes off in this book. I'm the mother of three and if my kids were this too-too I'd want to retch. Eyekk. Please, Ms.Reichl, forget the mysticism and psychology and stick to your writing strengths. Who knew one could salivate over a description of squid ink?"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"It took me over half of the book to warm to Ruth's ways. I felt too many times she built up a scenario and left me hanging, wanting to know more. I was desperate to find out what happened... if there was any comeback from the charity couple, how the guy she duped on a date with her sexiest disguise reacted to finding out he had in fact been dining with the NYT critic, what the Chinese restaurant who had diligently faxed menus back & forth felt when she decided to unceremoniously dump them for some other venue, after so much effort to please her.Its a light read and charming enough, but my appetite was whetted and I craved more gritty details."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If comfort food were a book, it would be Garlic and Sapphires. Ruth Reichl's writing is warm and inviting, instantly pulling you to her. She describes food and friends with a sensuality rivaled only by Pat Conroy's ability to elevate small human encounters into lush emotional landscapes.As much as this book is a journey of restaurants and food, it's equally an exploration of identity. Ruth dons disguise after disguise to avoid being recognized at restaurants, and in so doing explores and creates different aspects of herself. The journey is compelling and fun. You'll feel like her confidante and her companion.I listened to Garlic and Sapphires unabridged on audio, narrated by Bernadette Dunne. Ms. Dunne has a mellifluous, melodic voice and gives a magnificent, joyous performance."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Still a great read, but not as good as Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples. Foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol, but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom, dad and other relatives and friends. The highs are not as high, nor the lows as low in Garlic and Sapphires. Reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader; that said, I hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I seriously doubt any restaurant is going to recognize me anytime soon. Regardless, I'm tempted to throw on a pair of rectangular rimless glasses, a thrift shop t-shirt, some low rise, trendy un-trendy jeans, and pumas and go as some Emo child and head to the next soon to be chic culinary hot spot. I would not only look Emo, I would become an Emo; annoying and disenchanted with everything. That's called sacrafice for art people, as I hate Emo kids (and goths, hippies, and any subculture like that in general). I would go undercover, and hide my true identity from the watchful kitchen staff. All for the sake of an honest, and real, review.Okay, so I doubt I'm known enough (if at all) to need a disguise. I'll also probably go and dress up for fun anyways, but most likely if you read Garlic and Sapphires - The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, then most likely you're digging around for your old wig from that Halloween back in 87' thats somewhere in your closet.Ruth Reichel, the current editor in chief of Gourmet magazine, and previous restaurant critic for the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times chronicles her (mis)adventures as she recently takes on her position at the NYT. The memoir opens up as she's on the plane to the Big Apple, when a restaurant worker on the next to her informs her of the bounty on her head. Ruth learns that every cook, prep chef, restaurant owner, waiter, and hostess is part of an army of personal stalkers. Even the plump plane lady can recite Ruth's personal information. This is how horror movies usually start.Ruth realizes her predicament: How can she retain her anonimity, and still correctly review a restaurant? Why, go in disguise of course! Ruth begins to develop (with a little help from friends for hair and makeup) a series of identities in order to infiltrate her targeted eateries and provide an accurate review. One that the everyday patron can take to heart on their own visit.However, each disaguise begins to take on as aspect of Ruth. She doesn't simply make up a persona to match the disguise, but she becomes that persona and subsequently a hidden personal outlooks of her own Ego. This leads to her confronting her dark side in the bitter and lonley Emily who snaps at the wait staff, adopting her bright and bubbly inner child as the smart and colorful Brenda, and recognizing the sexy-powerful Chloe and her apparently dangerously flirtatious tendencies. Each alter-ego strives for the experience that any everywoman would receive. Regardless who she is, she always provides an captivating experience for the reader.Of course, Ruth also goes into the nitty gritty, showing her devotion to her art. The politics her job plays in the food world, and the sacrafices in her family and social life that she makes due to it lay out the real life drama involved in the glitzy big city food world. The insight into how her personal and work life intertwine, and how her history of food has made her who she is gives pulsing motion to the book, putting life into the pages to be absorbed by the hungry reader.No review can really do this book justice. I picked this up on a whim with the intention of reading it for a week or two. I finished in in one weekend. I laughed out loud, and I sat on the edge of my seat. Any self proclaimed restauranteur should pick this one up right away.Enjoy!(review written for the blog, Vanilla Garlic)"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book was so good and entertaining that it was hard to put down. What was really interesting was seeing the finished review after reading the story behind it."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Annoying, trite, and painfully over-exaggerated.That is all. This short review is about the perfect length the book should be."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book was very entertaining, and the mind pictures that she creates from her descriptions are wonderful. The narrative of meals described while dining was so real that it made my mouth water to think of the tastes she was portraying. A very good book and quite funny. Looking at food and meals out have a different perspective for me now!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's latest book is a feast of wit, fun, good food and joie de vivre. For readers like me, who enjoy good writing about food almost as much as eating itself, Reichl's descriptions will be relished. All her books deserve a place on the shelf next to American icon food writer, M.F.K. Fisher.This book details her series of adventures in disguise, and how her different appearances affected the attitudes of restaurant staff people, and the varying level of service she received. Her accounts are both laugh-out-loud funny and thought-provokingly poignant.A woman of quick, far-ranging intelligence and subtle understanding, Reichl could be a successful writer in any field. Food lovers appreciate that she chose to write in their genre!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I thought the book was funny. It grabbed me from the first chapter and I laughed through the whole thing. This is a great read and I am up for reading any other books from this writer. Another great one is the glass castle and also Whispers of the wicked saitns. Great reads !!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"The subject hooked me in immediately - a famous NY food critic working in disguise, so as to experience the same treatment restaurants give to lesser mortals. Her reviews of these places gave well-deserved rebukes, and reading her newspaper pieces shows why she's a respected critic. Her palate is obviously exquisitely sensitive, and her knowledge of the business must be tremendous.But it's only in the short format of a review that I can read her writing with any enjoyment. In a book, all her defects of style become very tedious (despite her acknowledgments citing all the help she's had from top-flight editors!). She writes in a breathless, overblown manner, with no sense of narrative proportion. She introduces new characters in lavish paragraphs of purple prose, and then they vanish entirely from the book. Incidents of no importance are written up in minute detail, and parts that would have been worth developing are skipped over.Her descriptions of people (including her own disguises) call on every cliche in the romantic novel genre, and her dialogue plods along clumsily, stating the obvious at every turn. After a chapter or two I had to suspend the willing belief one normally brings to an autobiography - really, are we to believe that her late mother's friend nearly fainted on seeing her put on her mother's dress, because the resemblance was so utterly convincing? Or that her own husband failed to recognise her as soon as she put on a wig and some stage make-up? Reichl tells us firmly and at length that it happened, and since her writing is otherwise completely without irony, I gather she intends us to take it as fact.Overall, I finished the book wishing I'd followed my impulse and dumped it after the first chapter. I kept waiting for it to turn into the promised hilarious and charming piece, but I waited in vain. I was left with the impression of a woman self-absorbed, arrogant and shallow, who notices little and cares less about other people except as they massage her ego or give her fuel for showing her contempt. There is no attempt at developing a theme or plot, and no insight into her own or anyone else's character. If extravagant, adjective-riddled descriptions of food appeal to you, there's plenty of that - but even then, my vicarious enjoyment of the meals was spoilt by the feeling that she's only saying this to impress us all with what an infallible and sensitive judge she is. Yes, Ruth, I guess you are. That's why they employed you. But a little more humility and humour would make for a better book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Thank you Ruth Reichl! I have been reading your work for years and I always feel right at home. But this book is special to me because you have liberated me. When I go into restaurants now I will ask for what I want, change the meal, send back the bad food, and be whoever I wish. I laugh now when I recall the many times I have cringed at the bad seating, horrible meal, and indifferent service and meekly accepted it. No more! I have been set free. I realize now - I am paying for this experience. The restaurants need us - people who pay - to keep going. Let's make them earn it. Lead on."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"The book was/is in excellent condition. I loved the character Ruth became as her costume changed. Her son is amazingly mature and cooperated magnificently with her different personalities.

I'm trying my best not to buy any new books unless I need to (for book club). I already own quite a few books that I need to get through. Once my stockpile is lower then I can justify buying some new ones.Garlic and Sapphires is written by a former New York Times restaurant critic, and is a tale of her dining adventures in disguise. Her goal is to have a totally normal dining experience, because when she's recognized the chefs seem to pull out all the stops, and the service all of a sudden becomes amazing. She wants to be able to provide a review on the restaurant that anyone off the street would be able to experience, not rave about a restaurant then have a normal person go in and wonder why in the heck she thought it was so great. In an attempt to dine anonymously Ruth creates a number of disguises, each with their own persona, style and name. She does successfully go unrecognized, but over the years she becomes a little hardened and realizes it's time for a change (she eventually becomes the editor for Gourmet magazine). She began as a cook, and includes a lot of yummy sounding recipes in the book as well - a few I definitely plan to try. Reading about her dining experiences was fun. But there isn't really a plot per se, so it's not exactly a page turner. But overall it's a good read for any food lover (and a nice way to experience fancy New York restaurants that I'll probably never have a chance to try in real life)."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"A+Good service at a great price.

I had no problems at all."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I ordered the sample of this book and after reading the first chapter, decided to go against my rule of not paying more than ten bucks for a Kindle book. It was worth it. Well-written and amusing.I write a restaurant review blog, not that I am anywhere near her caliber, so I found her attempts at not being discovered to be amusing. Think Mrs. Doubtfire. It was interesting to read her observations on how she was treated, depending on the disguise she was wearing, and how she'd get into character. This book is not just a study in food, but also a study of human nature. I also found her descriptions of her dinners to be excellent, and mouth watering."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book was intriguing from the very beginning, when Ruth is recognized by a complete stranger as the incoming restaurant critic of the New York Times. To Ruth's utter shock, she learns that important restaurants in the city have virtually compiled a dossier on her, complete with photographs and background information. In that stomach-dropping moment, Ruth realizes that the job she hasn't even started yet is in jeopardy. Just as suddenly, she decides that she can outfox the foxes. Her mother's old friend is an acting coach who teaches Ruth the ropes in disguising herself so completely that even her personality undergoes change with each new \\"character.\\"Unlike her predecessor, Ruth aimed to review restaurants on how they catered to the average patron, not a powerful critic. As you might guess, there is a big difference. For me, hearing about those differences were the most entertaining portions of this book. Although Ruth's descriptions of delectable dishes were colorful enough that they practically leapt onto my taste buds, many ingredients and techniques are so foreign to my far-from-Manhattan experiences that I couldn't savor them the way a food aficionado would. (But they did underscore what I'm missing from chain restaurants.)Toward the end, as Ruth grows disenchanted with her job, the memoir wanders from the restaurant to the specialty food shop. Here, it adopts an almost \\"I heart New York\\" theme that bored me. Clearly, my enjoyment of her book corresponds to the periods when Ruth most enjoyed her job. Luckily for us readers and listeners, those periods comprise the bulk of this engaging book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I thought it was pretty good....not the finest piece of literature I've ever read, but it was good...and sort of an inside look at the world of restaurants and their proprietors and the class of people who go to the very best and finest restaurants and how they are treated as compared to how a frumpily clad person would get treated. I'd say if you are in-between books and need something 'lighter' to read..or in need of a fast read....this would be perfect. Some good recipes, too!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you liked Ruth Reichl's other books, you will definitely like this one.

It's a must read for fans of food, dysfunctional family dynamics, actors, and the socially curious among us."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I loved everything about this book and I wish Ruth was a personal friend. The concept-- the meals, the disguises, the reviews following the visits and then the personal touch of the recipes included....what a fabulous gift. Ruth seems like a person who truly appreciates her good fortune in life, and she is a very clever and talented lady. It was a privilege to spend time with her."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I'm a pretty die-hard \\"foodie\\" and I love to read books about food and travel (see some of my other reviews). This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I have to say I was skeptical at first because of the lack of \\"adventure\\" I assumed it would have. (How \\"adventurous was a book by the editor at the NY Times likely to be, after all...). And, I was right - if you compare this book to something by Anthony Bourdain or Bill Buford it does lack \\"adventure\\". But what it does have (and what I really enjoyed) was wonderfully-written observations on human nature; how we respond to one another based on our perceptions. There were sections that made me laugh out loud because of the ridiculous scenarios Ms. Reichl found herself in at times, and other sections that were heartwarming and familial. The book is really more of a memoir, and unlike most memoirs, I enjoyed it immensely.Yes, there are wonderful descriptions of food, and of the meals Ms. Reichl was fortunate enough to enjoy during her tenure at the NYT. She reveals a very interesting and new insight into not only the life of a food critic (and the inevitable \\"food politics\\" involved) but also the day-to-day workings of the \\"front of house\\" in many of New York's most famous restaurants.Bottom line, I don't think you have to be a foodie to enjoy this book. Ms. Reichl has a smooth and engaging style, and a perceptive ability to capture many nuances of human interaction that are missed by most other authors in this subject area. A great book for a long train, plane, or boat ride, or a weekend getaway."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you love to read about or cook gourmet food this book is for you!

I must say that I love getting a peek into the glamorous (and not-so-glamorous) world of being a restaurant reviewer. I mean, really! That's every foodie's dream job! I love that Ruth Reichl is so candid and honest in this book about the ups and downs of life as a New York times restaurant critic. I also adore her keen observations of the people around her (such as her mother's old friend and her loveable son).I find it satisfying that she also includes the final article that is published along with her notes and observations for an overall perspective. Ruth Reichl has a very down-to-earth and approachable style of writing.

I was wrong - it is so much more. Reichl is an amazing writer who describes the dishes she eats so well that you swear you can taste them.

A must-read for those who love food, eating out, and a great read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reading this book is almost as good as dining out. If you never have the opportunity of dining in the kind of establiments Reichl describes, then this is the next best thing. Ruth Reichl can paint word pictures with such clarity that even some of the most disgusting sounding dishes make your mouth water. One thing I like is the inclusion of a few recipes so it is a \\"twofer.\\" \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham\\" is a great companion book to \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" and it is quite by accident that I read one right after the other. The last several chapters of Reichl's book were very poignant, given the history of what has happened in NYC after the time period in the book. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and her writing leaves you still hungry for more. She and Dominique Browning should collaborate on a food/garden book. That would be most delicious!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you enjoyed Ruth Reichl's two previous memoirs, Tender at the Bone, about her childhood, and Comfort Me With Apples, about her earlier adventures in the restaurant and food writing business, prepare for a change of pace. Garlic and Sapphires is funnier, louder, and more memorable.If you are new to Ruth Reichl's writing, you can enjoy this one without having read her previous memoirs. Reichl describes how she stumbled into writing restaurant reviews and how she got the premier gig for any reviewer, The New York Times. And then it really gets interesting.She realizes on the flight to New York for her job interview that the entire New York restaurant world will be stalking her, since a review from the NY Times can make or break a restaurant. Knowing that she will need to remain incognito in order to fairly evaluate a restaurant, she comes up with a scheme.Enlisting the help of an acting teacher she knows, she comes up with a disguise and a persona to go with it. It works and she is able to review restaurants undetected for a time. But when she suspects her disguise has been discovered, she has to create another, then another. With every disguise, Reichl comes up with a new character to fit it, complete with backstory. She throws herself into these new roles, becoming the person inside the disguise.One character turns out to be her recently deceased mother, giving her a chance to work out a few unresolved issues, another character is a woman her husband finds disturbingly attractive, and yet another is so unlikeable that she has to discard the disguise before she ends up alienating her friends and family.Reichl writes about each episode without holding anything back. They are hilarious, or poignant, or fascinating, or all three. The only thing that could have made this a better book would have been to discard the out-of-date restaurant reviews at the end of each chapter and replace them with photographs of Reichl in each of her disguises."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I was very disappointed in this audio CD book. First of all, something about this book seems very self-indulgent. For example, CD1 goes on endlessly about how the author doesn't really want this top job, but of course, she interviews and ends up with it. It seems very disingenous. Second, stories from a job of eating out at mostly very fancy restaurants seems pretty irrelevant in 2008, when most people are struggling to pay their monthly bills and save for retirement. Listening for 20 minutes to someone describe perfect buckwheat noodles is rather tiresome. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the publisher has chosen a reader who is very dramatic and overly inflects each and every voice. She mimics a 4 year old child, a portly Yankee editor, old Jewish men, the author, a haughty, constipated sounding friend (Claudia),Italian waiters, etc. I guess some listeners might enjoy this, but it personally drove me bonkers. A matter of personal preference, I guess. Be careful you can handle this type of a narration before you opt for the audiobook."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Brief Description: Ruth Reichl became the restaurant critic for the New York Times in 1993, and this book is an account of her tenure there. Combining her personal account of the job (including the elaborate disguises she created to avoid detection), reprints of some of her reviews, and several of her own recipes for the various dishes and foods discussed in the book, this memoir is a must-have for foodies as well as an interesting read for non-foodies (like myself).My Thoughts: The only reason I picked up this book was because I needed a \\"book with a gem in the title\\" for the What's In A Name Challenge. As a non-foodie (I confess that I skip almost all cooking and food-related blogging posts), I wasn't sure if this book was going to resonate with me. However, the chance to learn about the life of a restaurant critic helped me overcome any doubts. I'm glad I gave it a shot because it was an interesting and relatively painless read (yes ... I skimmed the recipe parts). It was fun to hear about how she came up with her various disguises to eat undetected in some of New York's finest restaurants, and how her \\"radical\\" approach to restaurant reviews often caused controversy. I thought she was down-to-earth and egalitarian in expecting restaurants to earn their stars by treating celebrities and \\"unknowns\\" the same, and it was a kick to hear about her two very different experiences at Le Cirque (once eating as herself and once eating disguised as an old woman). I loved that she wrote about her experiences and then shared the resulting reviews that she wrote; it made the book to come alive and helped me to understand her as a critic. And darn ... she even made a non-foodie like me want to try some of these dishes! I think the appeal of this book extends beyond the foodie crowd, and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a memoir with a different spin."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you are interested in food and food critics, this is a awesome book for you. Ruth Reichl is a great author that should get some honor. Her book is filled with hilarious moments and the plot is just incredible.

I have always thought what a great job being a food critic was, as echoed by Ruth and her other food critic friend when they squealed, \\"Can you believe they pay us to do this?\\" And Ruth reveals that glamorous aspect early on in the book - the special treatments these food critics get at restaurants are fit for royalty.But Ruth wants to experience the restaurants like a commoner. So she disguises herself and creates a personality for each one. For me, a commoner who does not go to fashionable restaurants, it was an eye opener to see the difference in service if you do not look the part.Unfortunately, the costumes come off and Ruth is no longer a commoner. When she visits a sushi restaurant, she is shocked when a man dips his rice into the soy sauce instead of the fish. There are other foodie rules broken by commoners that Ruth criticizes, which shows that she is actually royalty at heart.Including the original reviews at the end of the chapter was very redundant. Although her descriptions of food were vivid, they became tedious and wordy as the book went on. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt, her reflections a bit short.Nevertheless, I liked that Ruth did try to stand up for fairness when it comes to treating different people, not only in restaurants, but in general. She also wanted to expose people to foods other than French, American, or Italian, and dared to review lesser known ethnic restaurants, which were not considered chic and created controversies.And in the end, Ruth showed me that all seemingly great jobs have a downside. Her son told her despite all the fancy restaurants, he prefers to eat at home with her. After that comment, I realized that I would not trade my life for what Ruth did. Despite all the glitz and glamor, it really is the simple things in life, like eating a homemade meal with your family, that gives us true happiness, and that is the greatest equalizer for royalty and commoners.3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"a completely enjoyable read, from the standpoint of a real restaurant reviewer.

I always liked Ruth and believed her to be a very down to earth person. This book in no way changed my opinion of her. Garlic and Sapphires has a good balance of food and non-food writing. I am a foodie and sometimes am disappointed when there isn't enough about the food. She accounts her experiences dealing with editors, and I found that interesting as well."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I relished this book. It's funny and inspiring. I loved the main character, preparing for her performance, including her many creative disguises. My mouth watered with descriptions of the food. I wanted to rush out to restaurants, to not only have a fabulous meal but to really pay attention to the ambiance of the restaurant, the presentation and taste of the food. This book wanted me to expand my experience from ordering a glass of wine and an entr&eacute;e to also include an appetizer, salad, and definitely dessert.

Times to the new position she held for 6 years in New York (an unwanted one at that.... and how she tried to blow the interview!). Ruth Reichl learns quickly that in New York the restaurants have been learning about her months before she has arrived into her new job. Rumor has it they even have her picture posted in the restaurants so everyone can be aware when she enters. A flight to New York gives Ruth time to come up with a plan....With the help of a family friend, clothing, make up and wigs, Ruth is morphed into several alter egos:Molly Hollis: A larger older woman, bland in her clothing choicesMiriam: The creation of her own motherChloe: A blond bomb shell who dresses to the nines, with red nails and lipstick to matchBrenda: The earth motherBy utilizing these different disguises, Ruth is able to dine in the restaurant she wishes to review without fear of being recognized or receiving special treatment.... in fact, with each disguise, she learns how the restaurants really treat their everyday customers... in some cases poorly, and in other cases - remarkably well. Ruth's reviews lead her to be the most influential restaurant critic in the country, but it was hard-earned.I loved this book. I picked it up from my library yesterday and this morning after I took care of a few home projects I settled into my cozy chair with a blanket and let the life of a restaurant critic both amaze and delight me. I enjoyed how Ruth came up with her many disguises, her funny restaurant happenings, and the opinions of her husband and five-year old son. I really enjoyed reading the story of the restaurant and the follow-up with the actual New York Times Review. Every so often Ruth wold drop in a recipe as well which has inspired me to do a little food creating myself - which for me is a rare occurrence!I never knew I would enjoy a book like this but I am so glad I read it. Ruth's writing is fun, down to earth, and filled with facts I never knew about food and cooking. (note to self: wasabi has a smoother and milder taste than shaved fresh as opposed to the powdered version).Truly a delight that I would recommend to any food lovers"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"There's way too much that I love about this book. I mean, it's written by Ruth Reichl who lets you into her life like she's your best friend and wants to share all her secrets with you. And in this case, it's secrets that are hard to come by. Secrets that any food lover is going to want.I admit I've always dreamed of having a job as a restaurant critic, so Garlic and Sapphires was like a peek into the life I dream of. It's indulgent but real. You might have heard not-so-fabulous things about Ruth Reichl's other books (they weren't my favorite), but this book is awesome. Unless you hate food and eating at restaurants, you will get something out of Garlic and Sapphires.I'll never read a restaurant review the same way again. And I'll never go out to dinner the same way again. And that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book is my favorite by Ruth Reichl. She knows food, she loves food, she loves excellent food, and she likes a jelly donut with coffee from the corner stand every morning. She's a real person writing about restaurants.Ruth knew when she left LA for the coveted New York Times food critic assignment that she would get great food and great service is she appeared as herself, so she dresses in a variety of disguises and gets treated like all the rest of the patrons. Sometimes that means the same courteous service and sometimes that means being treated with disdain.Her in depth discussion about the food and wine and the atmosphere is reminiscent of Julia Child's My Life in France, which I loved. Adding to that are Ruth Reichl's great disguises and any foodie will thoroughly enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This was a terrific book and one that I have sent to many friends. It is honest, charming, and realistic about the NYC restaurant scene. The recipes were an added bonus. Everyone should read this, so that they know that it is perfectly acceptable to provide constructive criticism during a meal, to send things back if they are not up to standard, and to not put up with poncy behavoiur from wait staff. Congratulations Ruth!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's Garlic and Sapphires, an account of her years as restaurant critic of the New York Times, is simultaneously hilarious, refresing and poignant, altogether a five-star read in the light memoir category.The hilarity comes from Reichl's penchant for donning elaborate disguises, the better to assure anonymity in assessing New York's most prominent eateries. These incognita excursions allow Reichl to skewer the pretensions and omissions of such well-known restaurants as Le Cirque and Tavern on the Green.Garlic and Sapphires sets a refreshing tone due to Reichl's insistence on recognizing excellent dining in all of its venues, from humble ethnic restaurants to New York's most elegant establishments. Reichl's penchant for ferreting out little-known gems earns her the opprobrium of Bryan Miller, her predecessor as the Times's restaurant critic, and his supporters, all of whom charge Reichl with \\"letting down standards\\". But the many New Yorkers who experience life without expense account or trust fund appreciate her excursions to the wrong side of the tracks to identify dining delights.Most important, Garlic and Sapphires provides a poignant look at what it is like to be too old, too unfashionable, or too poor to fully take part in the glories of the Big Apple. Reichl's disguises frequently place her in one or more these overlooked groups, and she provides a sensitive picture of what it is like to be marginalized-- not only by headwaiters at four-star dining establishments, but by society. One hopes that Reichl's tenure as Times restaurant critic made top restaurants more likely to treat all of their patrons with dignity and respect.Garlic and Sapphires led me to develop the following advice for restaurant patrons:--As Reichl notes, restaurant preferences are subjective. Go to the places you enjoy, rather than the places fashion dictates.--Restaurants are there to serve you. If you are unhappy about food or service, speak up-- preferably to a manager, if your waiter or waitress hasn't dealt with the problem. Above all, don't be intimidated. If you need instruction on what fork to use or what wine to order, you should be able to ask without embarrassment.--You are especially entitled to fine service and cooking in a top restaurant-- don't let the establishment off the hook. If you have arrived on time for your reservation (or called ahead to notify the restaurant if you are delayed) and behaved courteously, any lapses in food or service reflect a deficiency in the restaurant, not a deficiency in you.--At least in the U.S., tips are discretionary. If you're not happy, reduce the tip accordingly. Feel free to advise your friends of the restaurant's shortcomings. And fortunately, you're not a critic who must return to give the establishment a fair chance. If you're not happy, you need never darken its doorstep again.One final piece of advice-- if you enjoy books about the food world, read Garlic and Sapphires."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This is my first Ruth Reichl book, so I really didn't know what to expect, but was intrigued by the title. I just bought this today and am almost done. It feels like the best kind of book, a novel that just grabs hold and pulls you right into another world. I'm right there, as she dons her disguises, dresses up as her mother, right down to the attitude, as she sends dishes back, or gives herself up to the sheer pleasure of the food without over-analyzing it. What comes across more than anything, is the pure passion for the food and her job,and the sincerity and respect for the reader as she sets out to share her experience and to rate each restaurant.She also has a way with description. I can almost taste these dishes, and am now starving...If you like food, and the restaurant world, you will have an absolute ball with this book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"It's one thing to hold the coveted job of restaurant critic for the New York Times but it's an entirely different matter when that person can deliver such a wonderfully breezy book about her experiences. Ruth Reichl has done just that in a style that is as warm, informative and delicious as the best restaurants she has reviewed.In \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" the author invites you into her world so intimately that you feel you are sharing each and every meal with her. It would probably have been enough if Ruth had simply given us a compilation of her entire collected reviews because she writes so well in that vein, but the joy of this particular offering includes a cast of characters who are not from central casting. While she manages to keep herself in the limelight, as she should, she surrounds herself with willing (and sometimes unwilling) cohorts in her attempts to review restaurants through her many disguises and personalities. Her usually understanding husband, Michael, her precocious son Nicky, her friend and sometimes mentor Carol, and her close buddy Claudia all add to her support as the author becomes Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily. A male critic could never have gotten away with what Ruth pulls off! It is a surprise to both the author and the reader that her dinner guests often become angry with her because she plays the roles of her assumed identities with such panache that they almost beg her to return to her own self.In one of the most alluring chapters, Ruth relates how she meets a total stranger, Dan Green, who ends up dining with her at Lespinasse. Keeping her secret, she spends an evening with him wondering what he will think of the review when he reads it. In another hilarious chapter she endures an evening with the \\"food warrior\\" at Windows of the World. Who wouldn't have wanted to be at the next table for that encounter?Through it all, Ruth Reichl keeps an eye on herself. She is her own best and worst critic, often worrying about thelegitimacy of her characters. In the end she simply reverts back to Ruth. As the book nears its close, Ruth speaks of her friend Carol's final illness and her own (ultimate) decision to leave the Times, a poignant reflection by the author. At this moment, knowing the book is about to be finished, I am reminded of that other moment when you've just finished an extraordinary meal and reluctantly acknowledge it's time to go. I highly recommend \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\"."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"After reading Tender at the Bone, I was looking forward to more of Ruth Reichl. Garlic and Sapphires was not only a disappointment, it was as if a completely different person had written it. It is ironic that in a book about disguises, Reichl herself was unrecognizable. Far from the funny, sensitive, and sincere person she was in her first book, Reichl had transformed herself into a self-absorbed snob loaded with enough hypocrisy to sink a ship.This book covers Reichl's stint as the New York Times chief restaurant critic. Although she accepts the position, she has reservations about the elitist implications of the job, and vows to write for the masses--those million readers who can't afford to spend $100 for a meal at a four-star French restaurant. Part of her mission is to expose the poor treatment many of these restaurants heap on the \\"common man.\\" But in order to accomplish this lofty goal, Reichl must eat in disguise. For if she is recognized as New York's premier restaurant critic, she'll be treated like royalty. (Although this obviously has no bearing on the quality of the food, it has a great deal of bearing on the quality of the experience. Personally, I eat for the food.)The idea is cute, and for the first few chapters it was fun. But Reichl shows her true colors right from the start when she heaps disdain on a bearded ignoramus (wearing Birkenstocks...unforgivable!) for having the audacity to dip his sushi rice-side down, thereby \\"ruining\\" the \\"clear transparent flavor,\\" the \\"taut crispness,\\" and the clam that was \\"almost baroque in its sensuality.\\" (I have yet to meet a sensual or almost baroque clam, but I'll take Reichl's word for it.) Reichl then reminisces about her trip to Japan, in which she is first exposed to the proper way to eat Japanese food. (I'm pretty sure the guy in Birkenstocks could not afford to go to Japan for eating lessons.) In her other encounters with diners at top-notch restaurants Reichl indulges in so much blatant one-up-manship that you simply can't sympathize with her concern for the \\"simple folk\\" no matter how much she tries to dress like them. The verbal food fights with the poor guy she picks up in a bar as the vampish Chloe (what's up with THAT??), and with the self-avowed \\"food warrior\\" were downright churlish. After proclaiming that there is no right way to eat food, Reichl clearly demonstrates that it's her way or the highway. Even Reichl's portrayals of other diners, who are merely innocent bystanders, are dreadfully stereotyped, sometimes to the point of cruelty. (She assumes that a \\"loud, brassy blonde,\\" who is disturbing her expensive meal, is a prostitute. Apparently, sitting next to the \\"masses\\" isn't nearly as much fun as pretending to write for them.)Even Reichl's disguises lacked credibility. Reichl's claims that she had an instant personality transformation with each new disguise are simply unbelievable. She BECOMES the 'little people,' taking on their imagined attributes, their voices, their very lives. She comes up with histories for each of the women she invents, and, with just a wig and some makeup, is so amazingly convincing that she can even fool her husband! Either Reichl is schizophrenic, or she takes method acting entirely too seriously. She certainly takes herself too seriously.If the book had been well written I could have forgiven the snobbery, but, with the exception of one chapter, \\"The Missionary of the Delicious,\\" in which Reichl was somehow able to get a grip on herself, purple prose abounded. (As her editor I would have crossed out half of her adjectives.) The inclusion of reprints of her published reviews was redundant, and the recipes were mediocre. (There was no clue in these recipes that Reichl was an expert in the kitchen. But, hey, she was writing for the \\"huddled masses yearning to eat free.\\" What do we know? We can't even dip sushi right.)If Reichl hadn't been so intent on wallowing in her ego, this book might have had possibilities. She loves food, and she has dined in some truly fabulous restaurants. The fact that most of us can't afford them is irrelevant. She had a duty to go to these marvelous places, enjoy herself to the max, and then take the rest of us with her."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"\`Garlic and Sapphires' is the third volume of memoirs by Ruth Reichl. After \`Tender at the Bone' which deals with her childhood and teens and \`Comfort Me with Apples' which deals with her early journalistic career in San Francisco, this latest volume deals with her five years as the lead restaurant critic for the New York Times.This volume proves that Ms. Reichl is truly the best culinary memoirist today, and easily the best since M.F.K. Fisher. And, as one who has read more than a few of Ms. Fisher's memoirs, I would easily choose Ms. Reichl's humor and great stories of the modern scene over Ms. Fisher's slightly musty, albeit exquisitely crafted tales of cities and towns in France.The primary point of this volume is to tell the stories behind Ms. Reichl's various disguises and personas she took on in order to dine at Daniel's and Lespanisse and Le Cirque without being identified as the restaurant critic for the Times. The book starts off with the amazing story of Reichl's flight from Los Angles to New York seated, by coincidence, along side a waitress of a major Manhattan restaurant. It turns out that posted in all restaurant kitchens in New York City was already a photograph of Ruth Reichl with a reward to any staff member who identifies Ms. Reichl in their restaurant.In spite of all the other things on which Ruth could dwell, she stays remarkably on message. There is only the slightest of references to the great New York Times culinary writer, Craig Claiborne, who was still alive while Reichl was at the Times. And, there was only a slightly more specific reference to R. W. Appel and Amanda Hesser. The only two writing talents cited to any extent are Marion Burros, a friendly colleague who mostly worked out of the Washington bureau and adversary Bryan Miller who left the critic's post and objected to Reichl's overturning a lot of his restaurant opinions. What Miller forgot was that the power of the restaurant critic's column was not based on the writer, but on the newspaper which published the column.The most important character in this story after Reichl may be \`THE NEW YORK TIMES', commonly thought to be the best and most powerful newspaper in the world. This fact makes it almost unthinkable that Reichl would question whether or not she really wanted to work for the Times when she was literally offered the job on a silver platter. There may have been some foundation to her doubts when she saw the Times offices for the first time. In contrast to the light, airy, Los Angles Times offices, the New York offices were crowded and filled with lots of old desks and unmatched chairs. After a full day's interviews plus total willingness from her husband to relocate to New York, Reichl took the job and immediately changed the tone of the paper's reviews.Reichl's personal philosophy was that reviews were nothing more than informed opinion and taste. This may seem utterly subjective, but actually, it is not far from what you would see in a scholarly work on the nature of aesthetic judgment. One is much better off trusting the opinion of a literary critic who has read 10,000 novels, both good and bad, than of your dentist who may have read 10, all from the same author. The thing that endeared her to her Times editors and publishers was the idea that her columns were written to sell newspapers, not to promote restaurants.For someone who does not read reviews of major Manhattan restaurants, I was a bit surprised at the incredible difference between the quality of food and service given to a pair of \`beautiful people' versus the quality of food and service given to a drab looking old woman. And, if the diner is known to be the critic from the Times, food and service quality goes off the charts. This was the reason for the many disguises. And, it is obvious that more than one was needed, as it was all too easy for an astute restaurateur to connect a person with the byline on a review which can change their gross by tens of thousands of dollars a week. The truly remarkable thing about many of the disguises is how the personality embodied by the wig and clothes became part of Reichl's persona in dealing with people who were not in on the ruse. By far the funniest was the incident when Reichl took on her mother's persona, using her mother's clothes and jewelry. The story is doubly amusing if you have read \`Tender at the Bone' where Reichl describes her primary chore was to keep her mother from poisoning any guests by serving spoiled food.It should be no surprise that Reichl's job had a serious downside. In addition to all the nasty mail from offended restaurateurs and their advocates and the political backbiting at the newspaper, there were the really unpleasant situations where Reichl offered \`a dinner with the New York Times restaurant critic' as a prize to be auctioned off for charity. Ruth recounts one especially distasteful episode where the situation went so far as to turn her well-trained chameleon personality into someone who was distasteful to her husband. This job is no picnic. From this encounter comes the name of the book from a line in T. S. Eliot's \`Four Quartets', \`garlic and pearls in the mud' which echoed the fact that the evening had nothing to do with Reichl's love of cooks, food, or writing.The book includes the Times reviews Reichl wrote as a result of the meals described in the book. These are fun and interesting, but are really just sidebars to the real action in the main text. My only regret is that Reichl did not find it useful to include photographs of her disguises.Very highly recommended reading for foodies and non-foodies alike."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"In contrast to the cover's stated premise, the heart of Ruth Reichl's newest book, \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\", turns out to be not so much about her covert efforts to produce a fair restaurant review. And that's a good thing...Instead, what she's produced is somewhat of a narrative on the transformations that occurred in her life while she the was chief restaurant critic of The New York Times. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of very funny stories and insightful looks into the life of a restaurant critic, but after reading over a few of them, I'm glad that she didn't devote the book to just this theme.To me, it got tiring after a while to read about her efforts to obtain the perfect wig or coat or look to enable her to step into another life beyond her own. Interspersed between the logistical procedures to obtain these covert reviews are lovingly told desciptions of the diverse foods of New York, served by ultra-uppity 3 star French joints to the painstakingly precise sushi bar.Also very worthy of mention are Reichl's recollections of time spent at the NY Times, as to the people she met, hated, feared, and loved. The latter primarily focused on a woman named (at least in the book) Carol, to whom Ruth pays particular attention, and conveys sincere emotion as regards their friendship.In surprising depth, Reichl conveys how, through her secret identities, she was able to learn about herself and her motivations / intentions when reviewing restaurants. Was it just about the food itself or about the \\"lifestyle\\" that comes with loving food?As such, ultimately, the thrust of the book is very much about food -- how it can in itself be excellent, mediocre, wonderous, or deflating and how the treatment of the waitstaff or the quality of one's companions can dictate the tenor of the dining experience.An oftentimes hilarious, and surprisingly sincere book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Other reviewers have given you the basic premise of Ruth Reichel's memoir about her years as a New York Times restaurant reviewer. I certainly agree with the opinions that this is a very funny, readable and personal story. Many of us -- at least many of us food enthusiasts -- wonder what it would be like to dine out nearly every evening, to constantly judge the merits of a restaurant (how do you keep notes?), to stay anonymous. Heck, I've always wondered how one gets a credit card with a Not-You name on it, a question that Reichl answers in the first few chapters.Those questions alone -- and Reichl's great prose -- make the book entertaining right there. In fact, I snuck out of work early and read the book straight through in a single day. (Shh, don't tell anyone.)However, Garlic and Sapphires exceeds simple enjoyment. Reichl is occasionally philosophical about what she is doing, by donning wigs and dressing up as other people -- ostensibly in her efforts to be anonymous. She became an actor, really, not Ruth-in-a-wig. Without beating you (or herself) over the head with it, Reichl examines how much of our self-image is wrapped up in our physical presentation.For example, at one point, Shirley -- the woman who sells the wigs -- comments about her customers, most of whom are women with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. \\"Shirley was beaming. 'I wish,' she said fervently, 'that you were here to talk to all my customers. These poor women come in wth no hair on their heads, and they have such a great opportunity to remake themselves. It's their chance to try on new personalities. But what do they want? To look as much like their old selves as possible.'\\" Reichl's friend Carol counters with the opposing view. In only a few paragraphs, you've seen all sides of an \\"identity\\" issue -- in the middle of an anecdote about choosing a carrot red wig.And the food. Did I mention the food? I learned more about fois gras than I ever knew.This book manages to be funny, thoughtful, and educational all at once, and you can read it over a weekend. Thoroughly enjoyable: I recommend it."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Author Ruth Reichl has written a very funny and poignant book on her life as a restaurant critic in New York. The book starts at the restaurant \\"Le Cirque\\" then proceeds on to her adventures at restaurants such as Honmura An, Lespinasse, Sparks (for meat and potatoes), to her experiences in Flushing, New York in which she is scouting out for Chineese food and ends up at the KB Garden Restaurant.In the book Ruth Reichl disguises herself with wigs and various clothing for the roles she plays when reviewing the restaurants. We meet \\"Chloe\\", \\"Miriam\\",\\"Brenda\\" and last but not least (my favorite) \\"Betty\\" in which she puts on a gray wig and goes to Tavern on the Green\\" in Central Park New York.To my greatest surprise, when reading the book, is to find out that Sea Bass is actually known as Patagonian Toothfish!!As Ruth Reichl says in her book \\"the fish didn't sell very well under it's own name. So they changed it.\\"Brava Ruth Reichl for a great read. I enjoyed every minute of this book - I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reichl's book, like her famous double review of Le Cirque, raises the probing question of whether the \\"best\\" restaurants truly have earned their titles by treating all of their customers as four stars restaurant should, or whether, instead, the four star treatment is reserved for \\"special\\" patrons. With that question she delves into issues related to food, class, and economics from her unique and powerful perspective as the NY Times restaurant reviewer. The reader cheers her reviews of Le Cirque, Tavern on the Green and The Box Tree, in which she took powerful restaurants to task for their failure to treat ALL patrons (rather than just the most well-known or privileged) with the respect and graciousness for which they have paid. My husband and I now have the luxury of being able to eat at such restaurants from time-to-time (though certainly not regularly), and we usually happily get what we paid for. But we *have* had occasional negative experiences like Reichl describes, and have seen others have them as well. As Reichl recognizes, many people \\"save up\\" to eat at these establishments, or visit them for very \\"special occasions,\\" only to be treated poorly. Restaurants who do not give the \\"four star treatment\\" to *every* guest (rather than the select few) are NOT, by definition, \\"four star\\" and do not deserve to be treated as though they are.Taking this point one step further, Reichl also uses her reviews to make New Yorkers understand that truly good cuisine need not be expensive, and need not be French. Her positive reviews of ethnic cuisine are educational and delightful. In short, Reichl might be seen as the democratizer of the NY Times restaurant reviews.However, at various points in the narrative Reichl seems to suffer from snobbery of her own (which she largely fails to recognize). Her behavior at dinner with the man who paid for a meal with her at a charity auction-- showing up his food knowledge, expressing extreme frustration that he wanted to eat at a nice restaurant-- and her nasty comments about the young couple next to her at another restaurant, for example, exhibited a sense of superiority that seems to run beneath the surface of her narrative. She acknowledges her poor behavior on these occasions through the words of her friends or her husband, but it would have been nice to see a bit more recognition of her limitations in her own words or discussion about her growth from these experiences.In addition, the deep \\"transformations\\" that Reichl claims overtook her when she was in disguise seem contrived. While I understand the need for the disguises, I (again) do not understand her need to \\"become\\" these characters and while \\"in character\\" treat others poorly, such as by leaving a cab driver no tip or making rude comments about others.While I found the book enjoyable, Reichl generally likeable, and the restaurant reviews fascinating, Reichl offended me by including her negative views on, and review of, Windows on the World. Writing in 2005, Reichl unquestionably knows that Windows on the World perished in the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, together with approximately 80 members of its dedicated staff who were on duty that morning, including its executive pastry chef and countless workers who undoubtedly took pride in their work at what was a pillar of New York. They are the images we see in news coverage waving towels out the windows of the top floor, begging for rescue. We have seen some of their family members speak on television about the delight some of them took from working at such a renowned establishment. Her inclusion of Windows seemed totally unnecessary except to tell her story about dinner with the \\"obnoxious\\" charity guest she could not stand. Did she really need to kick these people, or the memories of these people, while they were down? How hard would it have been to edit out?The book is very entertaining, and I applaud Reichl for democratizing the Times' restaurant reviews. I just wish she had been a little more thoughtful about what details she chose to include, and how she chose to frame them."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"No one will argue with Ruth Reichl's ability to discuss food as well or better than any foodie of our generation, and her New York Times reviews were generally very interesting, sometimes maddening but seldom boring. Her newest book of remembrance, this one focusing on her days and nights as the most powerful restaurant critic in America (more due to her position at the Times than to her own persona, as she often points out), certainly has its moments, and her recounting of the responses of her young son and her late colleague, Carol Shaw, to her many disguises and opinions is often affecting and entertaining. But this, her third book of foodie memoirs, does not hold the way her two earlier ones did; she seems a bit too full of herself too much of the time, and her constant stories of restaurant visits are often followed by the complete Times review, where everything she has just told us is repeated nearly verbatim. I also didn't need the blow-by-blow of each new disguise; it seemed padding to make the book long enough. This turns a rather slim volume (also featuring some fine recipes) into a much longer journey than it needs to be. And too often the recountings of events just don't ring true. While this was the case with her earlier books as well, it seems a bit too self-indulgent this time around. Perhaps the third time is not the charm?"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This is a fascinating look into what it takes to write a quality restaurant review. Visiting restaurants 3, 4, and 5 times, the disguises, the passion - who knew so much effort went into writing a single review. Most interesting was her depiction of how individuals are treated at high power restaurants... star treatment for those who matter, pot luck for the average person off the street. The book is incredibly entertaining, well written, and hooks you from the start on Reichl's plane ride from LA to New York. It also exposes you to a life of a critic outside of the restaurant. While eating at the best restaurants for a living many seem glamourous on the surface, Reichl provides perspective by exposing the reader to the sacrafices her family must make to accomodate her job, and to the various characters she must deal with from time to time. Her depiction of the \\"food warrior\\" was particularly funny. I was not able to put it down and finished it in one day. Great book!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I read her two previous books and found them to be a tad dull. What I was really looking for is what is in this book: her experiences reviewing restaurants for the New York Times. I didn't find the parts about her trying on different personas to disguise her identity to be objectionable at all. It didn't seem to me that it took up all that much space in the book, and it was interesting.The only criticism that I can make of the book is that I would have liked it to have been longer, with more stories. Having been to some of the restaurants, and having read her reviews for years, I really enjoyed the stories behind the reviews. I was glad to have a couple of the recipes, but could have done without them. The part about her coworker's illness seemed a little out of place in the book, as it didn't seem to be a terribly serious book otherwise, but perhaps it is just that I dislike running into sad stories when I am seeking to be entertained."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"For fans of Ms. Reichl's first two books (as well as fans of M.F.K. Fisher, A.J. Liebling, etc.) this book may well be worth reading. Yet, one longs already for the \\"revised\\" version where the names and descriptive characteristics are not changed and we are able to experience not only her lovely writing style but also more of the 'real' story. The book is charming throughout; it is just that the apology at the end (rather than at the beginning) for 'exaggerating the details' leaves a bitter aftertaste."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reichl has done it again. I was happy to find her latest memoir just as wonderful as her other two. I just love Reichl's writing. She is funny, down to earth, a mom. She seems like a regular person - not a snooty gourmet who talks above your head. I love the stories of her escapades in disguise and how she came up with the characters and how she completely inhabited them. But as much, if not more, I enjoyed her descriptions of her meals and how they affected her. Her love and understanding of good food is absolutely fascinating to me. I can't wait to read her next one about being editor of Gourmet Magazine."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book was great! I really liked the fact that the author would go out to restaurants in full disguise. What an interesting experiment to see how people are treated based on their status, how they're dressed, how they speak, etc. The descriptions of the food and tastes were so clear that I felt like I was actually eating and tasting the food! I also liked the fact that the author included recipes in the book.Read this! You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you've already read and enjoyed her first two books, then this is going to be again a pleasure for you. The book covers the period of her tenure as food critic at the New York Times. She recounts the trips (with her in disguise) to various restaurants with friends immediately followed by the actual NYT article that she wrote of those experiences. Interspersed in the book are various recipes similar to dishes that she had tried in those restaurants. What strikes me immediately from page one is her wonderful prose. She is continuously surprised and delighted by new culinary experiences and her prose beautifully captures the almost indescribable sensations of tasting new and wonderful dishes. I love the pineapple juice part. Like her first two books, this is not only on food but on life and on people. It's not a grand critic giving judgements from on high - it's the pleasure in dining (and eating) and culinary ingenuity shared by Reichl and her fellow diners. Now what I really want is a compedium of her food articles."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"As much as I enjoy cooking and restaurant reviewing, I'm not big into reading about food. However, a friend passed on this book and it grabbed me from the beginning. I enjoyed Reichl's experiences getting into character and seeing how the world (and high end restaurants) reacted to her in her different physical personas. Indeed, someone could write a great book just about this topic. I also very much enjoyed reading her reviews. I hadn't before and I loved how she weaved story and food report at the same time, in a way I hadn't thought was possible. I rushed through the book and enjoyed it thoroughly.I was indeed about to write a review of the book on my own site when I googled it, in search of a picture of the cover. One of the first links I found wsa the book's review in the NYT. It was a mostly favorable review but it pointed out an Afterword I hadn't noticed, one in which she admits she has tampered with the facts, exaggerating, conflating meals and events. Apparently she has also made up people. That I find dishonest and, not knowing what was true and what was not, I'm left with a bitter taste in the mouth. I'm not eager to visit her other books."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Oh to go undercover with Ruth to various restaurants in New York City in the 90s wearing wigs and costumes, what a perfect delight! It is quite obvious how profound an impact she had on the food revolution, daring to give legitimacy to Asian noodle restaurants when no one else would dare. This book is so entertaining to read, I loved every second of shadowing her on her food adventures. I will be attempting to make her recipe for Sort-of Thai Noodles very soon. For a foodie, this book is fantastic escapism to one of the food capitals of the world. To see the life of the most powerful woman in that industry in action? Pure bliss."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth describes getting her new job at the New York Times, the odd characters she works with and picking restaurants. I do like the fact that she would go to a restaurant at least three times before rating it, usually once as herself and other times in disguise. I did not enjoy the descriptions of the disguises, they seemed to go on and on. I more enjoed the descriptions of the staff at the restaurants and how she was treated. I liked the way she picked the places, one time she followed someone into a sushi place. I enjoyed her relationship with \\"Carol\\" but kept wondering where he little boy was during all the times she was eating and spending time with Carol.Overall, not bad. Definately not one you couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you love food, you will love Garlic and Sapphires. Ruth Reichl, newly hired by the New York Times as restaurant critic and already well-known as the Los Angeles Times critic, determines that she needs to disguise herself to get non-critic meals and service. Masquerading as various characters, she learns quite a bit about society at large, as well as herself. Further, Reichl describes her meals so vividly, describing flavors, aroma, texture, and oh my, the reader can feel like they are eating with her. Fairly quick read too. Highly entertaining and enlightening."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I so enjoyed this book! As a foodie and cooking instructor, I enjoyed Ruth Reichl's detailed descriptions of the meals she experienced, and I loved the behind-the-scenes politics of a big city newspaper in a town that takes its newsapaper, restaurants and restaurant reviews VERY seriously."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth writes with such passion about her love of food that I get a sense of what it must be like to be loved by her and how joyous it would be to be in her circle of life. She is sensuous, loving, knowing... Add to that powerful sensation her honest desire to educate and entertain her readers, she becomes a tour de force. Ruth is gifted with the wisdom of knowing the common denominator that binds us all together - food, food, fabulous food, and has a unique ability to take us to a higher level of enjoyment through her lush and sumptuous voice. I want to dance in my kitchen and tease my guests with the promise of a delicious crispy roast chicken and a lovely piece of creamy cheesecake."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"T.S.Eliot, \\"Four Quartets\\", \\"Garlic and sapphires in the mud\\".'You love to eat, you love to write, you love the generosity of the cooks, and what happens around a table when a great meal is served.' This is the Ruth Reichl we know and love as the editor of \\"Gourmet\\" magazine. She has written two books about her life as woman and chef. This third book is about her life as the Restaurant Critic for The New York Times. This is a great book, humorous, down- right laughing out loud funny, serious, and sensitive. And a story about Ruth and her life and family in the city she was born in and loves, New York City.Ruth was the restaurant critic at the Los Angeles Times and was very happy. Or, she thought she was. She had reviewed every great restaurant and received the laurels she deserved for her expertise. Unexpectedly, she received a phone call asking her if she would be interested in talking with the editor at the New York Times about a job. She agreed to come and talk, and the next thing she knew she was being interviewed by everyone and anyone that had any holding at the NYT. She was off putting, not sure she wanted the job, and, of course, they wanted her and, of course, she wanted the job.New York is a strange city. The chefs and owners of the grand restaurants placed her picture in their kitchens so that if she came to them, she would be recognized. So, Ruth had to take matters into her own hands. She started to wear disguises while eating at the restaurant she was reviewing, and she fooled them, fooled them all. She became Emily, her mother, a witchy bitch and a gorgeous blonde. She would visit a restaurant at least 3-5 times before writing a review. Her reviews were masterpieces. She can make or break a restaurant. She discovered that if the restaurants knew she was there, she was treated like a queen, while the everyday couple next to her, recieved a different meal than she did. After all, Ruth was there to review for the masses not the well known New Yorker. Ruth was able to complete her job with her disguises and such funny experiences she had. Her trips to the wig shop and the second hand clothing shops are hilarious. Her son, wanted to know about every disguise, and her readers were enthralled with her reviews. Ruth visited every neighborhood in New York, She met the great and the man next door. She was happy to just be around the thing she loves the most, next to her family, food. Ruth developed strange alliances and wonderful friends. This is more like a chat with your best friend, thant a novel. Ruth gives us her amazing recipes. I must try them all. There does not appear to be one better than the other.After five years, Ruth became tired of the critic's life and was looking for something new. What, she was not sure. However, a phone call came at the right time. One of the best books I have read in a long time- Admirably and heartily recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's \\"Garlic and Sapphires,\\" takes readers behind the scenes of the five star restaurant scene in New York, where she was the food critic for the New York Times. This was an entertaining read, with lots of great detailed description of the sometimes far out food she samples at some of Manhattan's top (snooty) restaurants. A quick read and you come out hungry for more!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Book was a delicious read............I lived through all of those restaurants in the 90's.............knew them all..............it was a very quick read.........2 days..........even trying some of the recipes."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you live in NYC or just enjoy eating in its restaurants, you'll enjoy this book.... so much so that I bought a second copy to give to my niece who knows NYC restaurants well."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth's writing style totally captivates me, her zest for life energizes me, and her ability to assess herself so honestly is refreshing. I found myself drooling over her descriptions of food, and laughing outloud at her disguise escapades. This is one awesome read if you love food or love to read about people eating food!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"For a book without much of a plot, intrigue, or even character development, it was OK.There are hints that she feels guilty about spending so much time away from her son but that goes nowhere.The food descriptions are luscious but get old after a few hundred pages.I even tried one of the recipes - the roast chicken. It was as dull as the book.Ms. Reichl must have gotten as bored writing it as I did reading it because it ends with the thud of a meal with no dessert."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This was a wonderful book about food and the way Ruth Reichl got to the top of the food critic pyramid due to her honesty, straightforwardness and passion for her job. I was thrilled to read all restaurant reviews, her own recipes and the episodes of her several transformations into different characters. A must read, definately."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl creatively describes her life as a restaurant critic for the New York times.I loved hearing about these restaurants, and her exploits to review them There are alsogood recipes. If you like to cook and try new restaurants, this is a great book to read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Am I the only reader who felt that Ms. Reichl's fascination with disguises bordered on creepiness? Perhaps I'm naive, but is theatrical make-up, a wig and a new wardrobe absolutely required in order to mask the identity of a newspaper food critic? Did it sound perhaps like Ms. Reichl had perhaps a bit too much time on her hands? Was it absolutely necessary that she create long and detailed lies to tell complete strangers (the manicurist and unsuspecting dining companion Dan Green)simply to write a compelling restaurant review? I think not. It seems she simply enjoyed playing dress up and putting one over on everyone.All in all, I couldn't get past the author's odd behavior to appreciate her talent as a food critic. While I did enjoy Tender At The Bone, this is certainly a book I would skip. As another reviewer here mentioned, many parts of it felt contrived, exaggerated and perhaps, with Ms. Reichl's penchant for creating an elaborate ruse, simply untrue."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I like the book til about 3/4 of the book. It was cute in the beginning, but it was getting tiresome. There were parts of the book that was funny. But, if you don't go to expensive restaurants, and know about gourmet foods and restaurants. It becomes tedious. I had a hard time relating since I don't go to pricy reataurants. But, it did give you a different outlook on the restaurant business. How they treat you. I go to my local restaurant, or coffe shop any day. They know my name, and it is personal. But, in these xpensive restaurants you have the status if you are somebody, and they will seat at the best table in the house. Getting back to the book, The best part were the disguises, how her family felt when she had all the disguises, now that was funny. The treatments of the customers if you were famous. They would get the best table in the house. And when she was found out to be the food critic of TNYT. Then they gave her the best table, the best wines, made sure she had a full glass of wine. I never even thought of going to a restaurant and being a social event."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I was so disappointed in this latest book. Loved \\"Tender to the bone\\", loved \\"Comfort Me with Apples\\", love your magazine, HATED \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\".I just kept thinking that it was going to get better and more interesting and it just didn't. And the recipes just happened out of the blue and were not very interesting.Don't bother buying. Wait until it hits your local library."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I cannot understand how a publisher can justify charging more for the Kindle version than paperback. It leads me to believe that as e-readers dominate the market place publishers are opting to gouge us with higher prices. It makes no sense when you consider they do not need to print or transport the books. So why the higher rate? Pure greed that ultimately hurts the authors because readers like myself refuse to buy the book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Book was listed as being in good condition; I would have said fair since it has quite a bit of water damage."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I read this book for our book club and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was meant to be somewhat lighter than some things we'd been reading lately and it was that; but it was also enlightening about ourselves and how we treat others. The recipes are wonderful! I've highlighted the recipe index so I can turn right to them!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I loved this engaging memoir by the New York Times food critic. I particularly enjoy Reichl's egalitarian view of fine dining (everyone should have the same great experience, famous or not). As a lover of good food and fine dining, I found this to be a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I am not a foodie. However, Reichl's writing is so vivid I found myself thinking about the dishes she describes. Her style is easy to follow without dumbing the language down. The novel is one part funny anecdotes, one part food, and one part introspection. A great read!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reichl is one of my favorite authors and I think I've read everyone of her books. Perhaps that is why I especially enjoyed this book. It was so much fun! I feel like I know Ruth from reading all of her auto-biographies. This book definitely gives you a different view of the competitive world of restaurants. I think I've enjoyed fine dining even more since reading her latest book. When's the next book??!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"If you are a food fanatic you will love this humorous yet informative book. Written with great insight and imagination it is a splendid true story. It is worthy of a Michelin star or two!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"A truly enjoyable read. Ruth Reichl is more than an epicurean, she is a poet. Her memoir takes you through an intensively personal account of what it means to become the foremost food critic in America.People who love food will salivate reading her descriptions of many varied types of cuisine she enjoys in its best form,People who don't dine out at fine dining restaurants very often could learn a few things, namely:DON'T DINE AT A TOURIST TRAP"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I found Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise by former New York Times Restaurant Critic, Ruth Reichel as enjoyable as a warm plate of risotto paired with a glass of red wine!In Garlic and Sapphires, Reichel recounts the six years she spent contriving clever disguises to hide her identity as she gallivanted around New York City's restaurants and bistros writing reviews for the Times. Reichel's memoir focuses on three aspects of her life at that time: her personal life as a wife and mother, her restaurant patronizing as a critic, and her life as an employee of the venerable and mighty New York Times. Reichel's descriptions of her son are touching and heartwarming, her recounting of the extremes she went to in order to create and truly become her aliases are entertaining and amusing, and her telling of the behind-the-scenes goings-on at the Times are fascinating and fulfill the gossipy voyeur in all of us.Reichel is a talented writer and her truly joyous love of food, cooking, and eating are evident on each page of the book. The book is peppered with Ruth's favorite recipes and this adds a certain feel-good warmth to the tome.My only criticism of the book is that I had to be willing to suspend my good reason in order to believe that Ruth truly became the characters she created to the extent she described. According to Ruth, she was so immersed in these characters that she found herself unable to use her own judgment and mannerisms while inhabiting that character's persona. For example, is she was dressed as \\"Miriam\\" she was brash and rude and \\"Ruth\\" had no control over the rude things that came out of \\"Miriam's\\" mouth. This was slightly hard to believe - but maybe I just don't have the same amount of acting chops!The title Garlic and Sapphires is only briefly alluded to and comes from a poem written by T.S. Eliot.Overall, Garlic and Sapphires is a delicious romp of a memoir that I truly relished devouring - excuse the puns!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reichl is a witty, smart writer who certainly knows her way around food. She has this uncanny ability to make food and the ritual of eating accessible to her reader, no matter how removed the reader may be from the actual setting. I recoiled in horror thinking about shrimp writhing as they died in the 'Dancing Shrimp' centerpiece in a chinese banquet, but nevertheless enjoyed reading her account of the events that unfolded on the evening in question.The characters that she works with are as colorful as the make-believe characters she invents, ostensibly to avoid being recognized as the restaurant critic of the New York Times. As she dons her various disguises, she adopts a whole new personality. The premise that adopting a new personality influences the experience of eating is as entertaining as it is revelatory. All in all, a refreshing, well-written book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reichl is brutally honest about herself, which makes for moving stories. At one point she dresses up as her crazy mother and enjoys the freedom of being an obnoxious old lady. I read this last book in the series first and it prompted me to order and happily read all the others."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I loved this book and if you enjoy good food, New York restaurants, and great storytelling, this book is for you. Read it cover to cover on a plane trip & laughed and salivated all the way through!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"My wife and I are happily going through the early chapters of this book, which arrived in somewhat less than sterling condition, proving the old adage that you get what you pay for."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I really disagree with the \\"most helpful critical review.\\" I absolutely loved this book! I am not much of a restaurant goer--I don't like cold dining rooms, I don't like to wait for my food--I like to be in my own kitchen, in control. I never went to Chez Panisse when it first opened and began to get rave reviews because it was in Berkeley and I lived an hour and a half south--that was just too far to go to dinner. And so often restaurant food is just not worth what one has to pay for it--I leave a restaurant thinking \\"I could have done that better,\\" and I spend the rest of the evening disappointed. This book, then, was a way to enjoy restaurants without having to visit them, to savor the good experiences and not have to suffer the bad. Reichl writes deliciously, her disguises were wickedly amusing, and her work became a road to self discovery. We all need to learn how to do that. I couldn't recommend a book more to anyone who is interested in good food."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This was the book my book club picked for last month. I would never have picked this book myself to read. It was very interesting and gave me a different perspective on dinning out and the restaurant industry. Ruth Reichle is one smart and interesting lady."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I was long overdue to read this book and enjoyed every last drop of it. Ruth Reichl writes about food in such a descriptive way that you can practically taste it. It's a book about more than just food reviews. Reichl gives you a glimpse into her mind and palette as she experiences food disappointments and pleasures from around the city.Her stories also paint a vivid picture of what it was like working for the NYT - an amazing, but competitive, news organization. There were many laugh-out-loud moments when she talks about her various food critic disguises. There were some surprisingly emotional side story lines as well, like the one about the department's secretary Carol.The balance of laughter, sadness and self-reflection made this book a treasured addition to my bookshelf. It's a must-read for the food lover."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I LOVE RR in general and have read all of her books, but this one was a big disappointment. A huge part of the book is old food reviews and the rest is the stories of the disguises she wore to restaurants and how she came up with them. This wouldn't have been a bad book if there had been less of the (now very old) restaurant reviews and more of the story telling surrounding them. This just felt like filler between publishing a greatest hits of old articles."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"The reviews got a little long at times. It was interesting to read of the disguises she picked and the recipes were interesting. Just a little too wordy which made it tiring to read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and seeing a different perspective of what food critics are like.

I love food. I love to cook it, eat it, read about it and watch it on TV. So this book was right up my alley. I loved her descriptions of her visits to the restaurants, and how the final review becomes the final word. Her descriptions of the food was mouth watering. And the disguises were insightful.If you really enjoy all aspects of food, you'll love this book.

She is able to combine her personal life experience, her desire for professional culinary satisfaction, yearning for husband and family and never ending quest for the perfect meal and wine pairings.

This book describes in hilarious detail the many disguises she assumed to turn the world of food critiquing into a reality show of epic proportions! Laugh out loud good. One should really start with her first book, \\"Tender to the Bone\\", to get the full effect of this writer's charm."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This was the first book written by Ruth Reichl that I had read although I was familiar with her through Gourmet Magazine. Her style is lighthearted and humorous which moves the story along well. At first glance it seems like a foodie book about her crazy tenure as a Food Critic for the times. The book wraps up with a deeper, introspective look at life and finding what really matters.

This book doesn't knock your socks off but it does provide an interesting look at the role of a restaurant critic for such a powerful publication. It doesn't provide any great insights, very little surprised me. I would have preferred to see more of the reviews and hear a little more on the wonderful food encountered. I'm not so sure about the role of the recipes scattered through the book. Most of them have little connection with their placing in the story."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I prefer to read on my Kindle but I can't see the justification for a higher price for the digital edition for this 6 year old book than for hardback or softcover. It's ridiculous and I won't support the publisher in ripping off Kindle users this way."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl is passionate about both food and humankind. She puts herself in the shoes of different common folk, through clever disguises, to see how snooty service staff in highly rated restaurants react to these group of customers.Only if both food and service meet her standards in her various disguises, then she would feel that she had a celestial dining experience & the restaurant would deserve its highest rating in her New York Times reviews.She has raised the bar for fine dining and totally humanized it. Way to go, girl!!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Some of us are fascinated with behind-the-scenes looks. We want our DVDs packed with \\"making of\\" featurettes. We want to go backstage with the band. We want our favorite foods \\"unwrapped\\" (as in the Food TV series). Ruth Reichl's book is the perfect memoir those of us who (1) have the \\"behind the scenes\\" fascination and (2) love food.If you've ever wanted to know how food critics prepare for, think about, and write their reviews, this is the book for you. In it, Ms. Reichl traces her journey from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times, shares how her husband had to talk her into the job, how the previous food critic Bryan Miller organized a smear campaign against her, how she disguised herself time and again to avoid being recognized by sharp-eyed restaurant staff.Like any good tour of New York City, we get to see an awful lot along the way. We see the petty editorial politics at the New York Times. We see the sometimes funny and often surprisingly bitter reactions readers have to reviews. We see the once fringe ethnic cuisines (e.g., Korean) go mainstream. We see all the New York Times writers cower in fear of Al Siegal, the notorious editor whose job it was to publicly ridicule writing not up to the notoriously high standards of the paper.Ms. Reichl weaves a rich tapestry of characters through her memoir, from her boy Nick to the wig seller who helps her perfect her disguises; from fellow food celebrities such as Ken Hom to Claudia Banks, the acting coach who helps her flesh out each of the identities she assumes. But it's Living section administrative Carol Shaw who steals the show as the most richly rendered, three dimensional character. You can't be help liking her.Ms. Reichl writes honestly and poignantly. She's as critical of herself as she is of the worst restaurants in New York City. In one memorable scene, her husband excuses himself early. Thinking that he left to get away from an obnoxious dinner guest, Ms. Reichl is startled to discover it was actually to get away from her:----\\"I couldn't say and watch what you were doing. I hate it when you pretend to be that person.\\"\\"What person?\\" she asks.\\"The Restaurant Critic of the New York Times. The Princess of New York. Ms.-I-know-I-am-right-about-food-and-don't-argue-with-me. Take your pick.\\"\\"What I that bad?\\" I whispered. My cheeks burned and I could feel the sweat prickling against my skin.\\"Worse,\\" he said. \\"You were the person you used to make fun of.\\"----All in all, this is a great, memorable read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Rarely do books make me laugh out loud in public when reading them, but this one did multiple times. Ruth Reichl does an excellent job of telling of her hilarious undercover adventures as a food critic for the NY Times. You don't have to have a lot of knowledge and experience of fine foods and restaurants to appreciate her viewpoints as she poses as an old woman, seductress, uptight woman, a complainer, and more. Reading about her characters' experiences is as enjoyable as being at the restaurants with her. As a New Yorker, I can say she hits the nail on the head as far as the culture and attitudes of different sorts of people who live, work and of course, eat in the city. A very enjoyable, quick read - and you'll never see restaurants the same way again."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"The third memoir Reichl has written continues with the common theme that not everything is as it seems at a glance. Here she tells of her years at the New York Times as their restaurant critic.(a position which many might envy) She spent so much time hiding behind many disguises and attempting to convince many that there wasn't more than meets the eye; everyone from the servers of the restaurants she was eating in to herself who faced a considerable onslaught of criticism from readers when she became their restaurant reviewer. The sweetest moments of the book have to do with Reichl and her son Nick who was quite small when she got the job and her own recollection significant moments with food and restaurants from her childhood. She had returned to where she had grown up and she was being re-introduced to old memories and even to her Mother who had past away. Another thing I really liked in the book was a few recipes that she had mentioned in passing from her other books were finally published in this one. This volume contains recipes and some of her restaurant reviews as well so it adds another element to the writing. You are given some subtext when she tells what was going on at the time and so there are many layers to the writing and hidden emotions.Reichl has yet to disappoint me with her memoirs but this book has a much happier tone in comparison to the last one. It isn't until the end that there is considerable sadness but it ends with hope and possibility."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"\\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" is the first book of Reichl's I've read. I knew going in that it is generally considered to be the weakest of her three books, but I was intrigued by the true story of an incognito food critic. I was somewhat disappointed, though I'm finding it hard to pinpoint exactly why. I think the main disappointment for me was Reichl's writing style. When writing about food, she does an excellent job conveying with words the experience she's having as she tastes a wide range of dishes. But when writing about other things--and most of this book was about these \\"other things\\"--her writing is simplistic, almost as though she'd written a children's novel. Additionally the stories in the book, through presumably biographical, seemed to be coated in an egg wash of retrospect and Hollywoodization--the people seem too much like stock characters from a romantic comedy. The wig store owner is a particularly egregious example of Reichl's overdescription. Reichl's descriptions of her assumed personalities are similarly weak--I don't fault her for relying on stereotypes for creating these personalities (for that's what I would do if I were in her shoes), but what I do fault her for is her willingness (weakness?) to be completely swept away by inhabiting the role. You're a food critic, Ruth, not an Oscar award-winning method actor, so please don't try to convince us that you couldn't find a happy medium between yourself and Emily or Brenda.Despite Reichl's writing and rom-com stylings, I did enjoy the book because Reichl comes off as a person I'd like to know, and she allows the reader a good degree of intimacy with her thoughts and feelings.As an aside, does every \\"good\\" restaurant in NYC serve foie gras with fruit and some variation of creme brulee??? I mean, come on, you four-star chefs--there's an endless variety of food out there! I wish Reichl, with her appreciation of ethnic cuisine, had smacked some sense into some of these hoity-toity restaurants while she was at the NY Times!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I was in Long Island visiting my mother-in-law, and ran out of things to read. This book was on her deck. I picked it up and was hooked by the second page. Being completely food illiterate, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy it. I read it in two days. I am now reading \\"Comfort Me With Apples: More Adventures at the Table\\" and can't put it down.Ruth writes with such honesty that you want to become her friend. Her figurative language is extraordinary, and makes me want to become a food warrior. I doubt this will happen, but I am living vicariously through her words.I love the recipes that are peppered throughout her books. Several, like lemon pasta, and the goat cheese on toast, are easy, elegant, and can allow a neophyte like myself seem like a great cook.Even if you aren't into food, Ruth's story is entertaining, and wrapped in prose that is remarkable."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I loved this book. It just shows that these so-called fancy restaurants are mostly overrated. I found it fabulous that the food critic had the guts to go out and review the mom and pop places out there that often go unnoticed. The author also had a good writing style that kept my interest throughout the book. Plus, we are still using some of the recipes she included in the book."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This is a warm, witty, and fun memoir from a real, warm female. She is so self-revealing that it can be shocking. I was delighted to find out Ruth Reichl has written two other books about her life that preceed this one in time. I've read one--Tender at the Bone--wonderful--and now I feel compelled to read the next one, and then Garlic and Sapphire all over again! I love all the loving talk about food, and the light but meaningful touch on relationships."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I laughed out loud tons of times during this hilarious look into the undercover world of restaurant critics. Reichl shares the disguises and personas she employed as a critic, to see what the average person experiences when they go to a restaurant. It was outrageous and thrilling to watch her take on rude service and sub-par food (served to her when she is dressed in dowdy clothes) and then go back to the same restaurant as the star critic, getting bigger and better portions of food and getting seated ahead of waiting foreign royalty.I rooted for her different personas and was indignant at the treatment she got as a regular person at some of the snobbier restaurants. I loved the story about how at one restaurant, they recognized her and whisked away her half eaten raspberry tart and replaced it with a raspberry tart with, get this, bigger berries! Can you imagine someone in the back of the restaurant picking out VIP raspberries for the VIP tarts?I loved the food descriptions and the sometimes unglamorous look into the life of a critic. The food isn't everyday fare, but I don't read Ruth Reichl to hear about the types of meals I can afford - I could write about those myself!Her exposure of snobbery, and the care she takes to try and show the restaurants who care for us normal folks like we are all VIP's, was touching and made for satisfying reading.The abridgement on this audiobook did not feel truncated or like I missed out on anything important. She narrates the book herself, and while her husky, measured voice took some getting used to, I loved that she was able to give just the right inflection to each persona and to carefully emphasize her feelings and actions. The audiobook has some recipe cards included and has an interview with the author at the end.One of the rare audiobooks I am keeping in my permanent collection for years of relistening."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"A devout NYC metro-area foodie, I have read all of Reichl's books and love her writing style, which I find honest, touching, informative and insightful. Garlic and Sapphires was my favorite. To boot, it is a great diet book and it will save you lots of money if you [think you might] like eating in fancy restaurants. By this I mean, she paints such vivid pictures of food, including appearance, textures and tastes, that you actually feel like you're tasting her words, sans the calories. And if your friends have ever told you you were just being paranoid about being treated differently (i.e. much worse) than the rich and/or famous at most well-known restaurants, you will feel sadly vindicated. My only huge disappointment with Garlic and Sapphires was that it didn't include pictures of Ms. Reichl as Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily. These larger than life characters who helped her slither undetected through the city's culinary palaces screamed out to be seen! But I loved that she allowed new personalities to accompany each disguise and that she shared her insights about what she learned from each one. Forgetting about the food for a moment, what woman wouldn't long for a job like this one that allows/requires you to transform yourself into a slinky blond, a sassy redhead or their own mother (gasp), on an expense account?! Throw in designer and/or vintage clothing and food and it's a career made in heaven. For me, anyway. If none of this appeals to you you may not enjoy Garlic and Saphhires, but I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Absolutely delightful! Talk about a surprise between the covers! This book has changed the way I think about food. I should slow down and taste the food--that there is more to eating than eating!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Having read Reichl's previous book, Tender to the Bone, I was prepared to be amused and entertained By Garlic and Sapphires.

I loved it and want more Ruth Reichl!In the book she only briefly refers to the meaning of its title, saying that it's a line from T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets: Burnt Norton. I found this interpration of that line in the poem on sparknotes.com:\\"Ruins also call to mind fragments, especially of the kind that make up Eliot's earlier poetry. The first line of the second section of \\"Burnt Norton\\"--\\"Garlic and sapphires in the mud\\"--highlights Eliot's new attitude toward the fragmentary nature of modern culture. This famous line juxtaposes a series of random things, but the effect is not the atmosphere of belatedness and melancholy characteristic of The Waste Land. Rather, the collage-like arrangements of this section form a nearly coherent whole, a meaningless song that sounds traditional but isn't. Again fragments and ruins stand in defiance of human aspirations, only this poem does not lament that things once made sense and have now ceased to do so; rather, it declares that coherence never existed at all--that meaning and human experience are necessarily mutually exclusive. \\"The book cover left me feeling deliciously frustrated since her face is obscured.

The missing fifth stars says more about me than the book. Five stars would require taking my breath away.The book appealed to both my passion for food and cooking (complete with descriptions of amazing meals and recipes) and the sociologist in me (Ruth Reichl descriptions of how she was treated in various disguises).

I love my Kindle, but it's immensely frustrating to actually pay two dollars *more* for an eBook that is so poorly edited and put together. Don't buy this as a Kindle edition!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"\\"The slippery noodle slid down my throat leaving a salty wet residue on my lips. I gently licked it off with my tongue and sent a tingle charging down my spine.\\"Did that sentence make you uncomfortable? Because it sure as hell made me uncomfortable the first time I read it; especially given the fact that the author is not describing a sexual encounter with an unfortunately endowed man. No, that grotesquely erotic narrative is actually referencing Reichl's first bite into noodle dish served at a dumpy Korean restaurant in lower Manhattan. Creepy. Here's the thing; I am no prude. I love me the occasional steam in my reading rainbow but when a prix fix turns passionate, the walls of my comfort zone are breached and Sister Mary Sanctimonious takes over. Again...creepy.Now, all that aside, I was really looking forward to reading Garlic and Sapphires and I am really disappointed by how little I enjoyed it. What I thought would be a fun, food filled account of this woman's first year as the food critic for the NYT is in fact a compilation of short stories punctuated with recipes and excerpts of her actual reviews. It was very choppy and ultimately tiresome.Another point of irritation was the repetition. In those chapters that included a story + the review, I felt like I was reading the same thing twice. Reichl would tell the story about her experience at a restaurant and then post the article as it appeared in the paper. The only thing is, it was often the EXACT SAME narrative. That's just sloppy editing and a waste of paper.To be fair I did enjoy reading about the different types of food that's out there. If anything it was a great education and I admire people daring enough to try the more exotic fare (seafood chowder garnished with squid ink? Squid ink?? No. Absolutely not). However, the culinary creativity was just not enough to keep this book afloat and in the end I was happy when the meal was over."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"As a foodie and a wine lover, as well as a person who loves New York, this book was like being in heaven at the same time as being a voyuer. I often go to the \\"starred\\" restaurants and have my own opinion not only on the food but on how I was treated as a normal everyday person. Having a food critic do the same in costume and actually rate the restaurant based on this makes me want to give her a standing ovation. Hopefully, restaurants around the world have learned something from her and her very equitable way of evaluating restaurants. Ruth writes so very well and entertainly, and you are torn from your own reality into her world of costumes and intrigue. I highly recommend her books if you like food, wine and real life New York restaurants. It may change where you decide to spend your hard earned dollars next time you go out to eat."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Gourmet magazine's editor-in-chief Ruth Reichl provides a sometimes funny and often insightful account of her days back in the nineties as the New York Times food critic, certainly one of the most influential culinary posts in the world. She obviously did not take this responsibility lightly judging from the amount of effort she went through to disguise herself in restaurants she had to review in order to avoid preferential treatment. In fact, one of her more intriguing insights is how a fine dining experience can and should be the great economic leveler, and her disguises would often reflect a lower socioeconomic status or an out-of-place temperament, including pretending to be her own mother. No matter whom you are, according to Reichl, you can walk in and place your credit card on the bill tray, and for however long you want to be at a formal restaurant, you can be anyone you want to be. Like a paid fantasy come true with no emotional repercussions, one of the big reasons people go out to eat is to have that experience of being glamorous and wealthy. Reichl understands this concept clearly, and she is enthusiastic about helping people appreciate what they're going to experience in the way that any good film, art or dance critics can.Her zeal can be infectious, especially as she breaks with tradition and explores ethnic food in the outer boroughs of New York with creative abandon. Her approach apparently did come at a price as she has made enemies at the Times and among those who had come to expect four-star ratings from the paper. When she describes her courage in facing her adversaries head-on, Reichl can come across as smug and sometimes cloying in her attempts to deflate egos, even though she offsets those comments with discourses on colleagues she truly does love and respect. Moreover, she fluently displays a breadth of knowledge about the overall trends in the American culinary movement of the last quarter century. The author doesn't quite have the been-there-done-that tone of Anthony Boudrain in his books, \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" and \\"A Cook's Tour\\", nor does she have the idiosyncratic wit of Alan Richman in his eclectic food travel tome, \\"Fork It Over\\". But Reichl's book does lend a uniquely personal perspective, is it is as much about politics at the New York Times as it is about food, an almost professional survival manual that would serve both present-day foodies and future food critics equally well."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Get the scoop on what life is like as a foodie writer! What may seem like a dream job certainly has its quirky side! Reichl writes to entertain and inform and you need not live in New York to appreciate her New York moments in the eatery scene. She fairly gives all eateries their due, from hole-in-the-wall ethnic cafes to uptown linen and stemware fine dinner houses. This books makes an excellent gift to readers in the trade or for those who simply enjoy eating out."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"The title of Gourmet magazine editor Ruth Reichl's third food memoir comes from TS Eliot's Four Quartets and is courtesy Ruth's husband, Michael but the reader doesn't understand his reasoning for the quote until near the end of this delightful collection of tales of Reichl's time as food editor of the New York Times.Filled with stories of her life as a critic, reviews of New York restaurants--well known and some not as well known, as well as recipes, this book is absolutely unputdownable. Imagine, if you will, how Ruth discovers, on a trip to NYC that her photo is plastered on bulletin boards in restaurants all over the city and decides that that she's not going to be able to go to restaurants as herself and fairly do a critique. Instead she devises a plan. She will go incognito. Ruth enlists an old friend of her mother's who was an acting coach and with her help she becomes Molly, a middle aged woman from the Midwest; Brenda a vivacious and friendly woman; the sexy Chloe; Betty a plain elderly woman, and even Miriam her own cantankerous mother. As one can well imagine, these women get very different treatment from one another and VERY different treatment from Ruth Reichl, the food critic.My mouth was watering as I read of Ruth's experiences in restaurants that I can only dream of eating at in NYC (although I do admit that I will attempt some good sushi again after reading how it is properly eaten) and I know that many a fine eating experience will be enhanced.I borrowed the three Ruth Reichl books from the library, but will be buying copies of my own for my keeper shelf. I am not sure if I will eventually try any of the recipes, but I sure want to. The only thing that disappointed me was that after reading these three books, one right after another, that there are no more Ruth Reichl books to read. I guess I am going to have to satisfy myself with a subscription to Gourmet magazine and hope she has another book in her future with which to entertain her legions of fans."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"First, the obvious: food is for eating. Food is very, very rarely fun to read about; we may think we enjoy it, but ultimately, it's no fun being teased unless we can have some kind of release at the end (and last I checked most food books don't come with a mini-fridge). For this reason, food literature seems to appeal to a very particular group of masochists, or those who at least have the means and ease of running out to satisfy their cravings when the going gets tantalizing. Somehow, however, Ruth Reichl manages to make not only writing about food, but writing about writing about food both entertaining and gastronomically bearable.In Garlic & Sapphires: The Life and Times of a Food Critic in Disguise, Reichl grudgingly accepts a position as the new NY Times food critic, but the trouble starts before she even moves to New York to start the job. On a plane from LA, she is recognized by a waitress who begs her to reveal where she'll be eating that night, confessing that the information is worth a lot of money in the high-stakes restaurant world of the Big Apple. Not only does the waitress know Ruth by sight, however, but she quickly ticks of a list of personal details like the name and age of her son, and what her husband does for a living.The lack of anonymity may not be a problem for some food critics, who make it their business to dangle coveted four-star ratings before chefs who are all-too eager to create fabulous dream-like meals and offer the most idyllic table service. After all, the Times picks up the bill, and what would be the point of paying big bucks for small fries? Reichl, however, sees herself as something different - during her interview, she openly criticizes the paper's high-brow approach to restaurant ratings, telling the editors that most people reading the reviews will never be able to eat at Le Cirque or Daniel (at least not on a regular basis) but want to be able to imagine that they can. And once they're there, Reichl discovers, they probably never get the same service as the glitterati.It quickly becomes established Ruth Reichl is the Peoples' Food Critic (which occasionally gets her into trouble at the paper and with her readers). So, in order to maintain her anonymity - to have a truly authentic experience as a diner - she begins to don disguises, taking on different identities in her quest to rate the restaurants of New York with open eyes. She gets in character, complete with wigs, make-up, and costumes that render her unrecognizable to her coworkers, the elevator operator, and her husband (but never her pre-school age son, Nicky, which becomes one of the book's many charms). She dons the attitudes of her fantasy eaters along with their clothing, becoming in turn her mother, a red-headed bohemian that her husband develops a crush on, or a frumpy and invisible forgotten old aunt at a table of her friends and colleagues. The differences in how Reichl is treated (often going to the same restaurant in and out of character) is astonishing, and these moments are the punchlines of the memoir.Reichl's work as an editor at Gourmet shows; she seems to anticipate potential criticisms. After I started feeling a bit uncomfortable reading about the casual consumption of fois gras and the lunch menus of the elite, she addresses the morality of being a food critic. One review near the end feels lackluster and a bit dull; the following chapter explores a period of ennui, as she tires of the costumes and the pomp and circumstance of eating out. Occasionally, text in the chapters and the reviews were a little repetitive, and at times the restaurant reviews are a bit anti-climactic (maybe because Reichl's writing skills have since improved, or because of the mandated seventh-grade reading level for newspapers). I sometimes tired, just a little, of the descriptions of foods that I will probably never eat myself.Still, Reichl does such a marvelous job of putting you in the seat of a restaurant critic (or one of her ill-treated characters), that it's easy to play along; her descriptions of food manage to conjure the intangible and utterly personal.Her treatment of the gender, class, and generational issues pervasive in the world of fine food gives Garlic & Sapphires more weight. Each chapter is a different restaurant experience, typically with a new character, and includes the original restaurant review and Reichl's own recipes (an acceptable substitute for a mini-fridge). I've found that my own experience of going to restaurants has changed for the better since reading this book, which is probably the highest praise one can offer someone who spends a lot of their time writing about food. Reichl manages to balance our interest in and out of the restaurants, through the streets of New York, and in the office, delivering a fast-paced and dynamic memoir - it's almost good enough to eat."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Anyone interested in food and dining MUST READ this book. I bought it in the San Francisco airport after a gastronomical honeymoon blowout (1550 Hyde Street, The Slanted Door, Chez Panisse, Bouchon, Cyrus) so I didn't feel TOO envious at Reichl's mouth-watering descriptions of divine meals at New York's finest restaurants.... but I appreciated her attention to the vagaries of atmosphere and service in such places. I never realized how \\"democratic\\" Reichl was, compared to other NYT reviewers -- radical, even -- going to lengths of disguise in order to see how these places with their astronomical prices treat the \\"average\\" person. Frequently, like crap! (Fortunately we didn't experience this anywhere in California.) Also, she put more of a focus on \\"ethnic\\" restaurants than reviewers before her, which was prescient. Honestly, I was lukewarm on Reichl's other two books, and I'm not too crazy about that crazy yellow-fonted Gourmet cookbook she did... but this one is great. It's interesting, well-written, and charming. Oh, and I tried her recipe for the Afghan dish \\"Aushak\\" (dumplings with yogurt and meat sauce) and it was AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl (the \\"ch\\" sounds like a \\"sh\\") is in love with food, and it permeates her writing. I love good food: my wife makes wonderful food and I appreciate it; but in her absence, I add extra cheese slizes to frozen pizza (always lacking in cheese). So I'm not Reichl's natural audience. Yet when she describes the food, her writing is almost magical. She reminds us that food is art, that food is beautiful and sensuous and exciting and fun. She (almost) makes me want to eat a $100 meal.This memoir recounts her time as the chief food critic of the New York Times, from 1993 to 1999. In order to avoid simply describing how the restaurants feed important people, Reichl enlists an acting coach to disguise her. In the course of the book, Ruth becomes Molly (a nouveau-riche Midwesterner), Miriam (her own mother), Chloe (a gorgeous blond), and so on. Each disguise takes on a personality, and what Ruth learns about herself and others through each one is really interesting (although I felt the stories drag once or twice).Occasionally Ruth tempts us with tidbits on the political and social importance of food (how politicians signal affiliation with minorities by eating ethnic foods, for example), and at one point she brings up an issue that made me uncomfortable throughout the book: she writes an article entitled, \\"Why I Disapprove of What I Do: It's indecent to glamorize a $100 meal. Or is it?\\" But it's just a tease: her answer is unsatisfying, and the reader is left to decide whether glamorizing elite food in the face of world hunger is okay or not.Her husband, at one point when she gets caught up in the glamour of her job, reminds her why food is really important (besides the obvious biological role): \\"You love to eat, you love to write, you love the generosity of cooks and what happens around the table when a great meal is served.\\" In an interview with the author at the end of the unabridged audiobook, Reichl adds insightful comments on the social role of eating together and the value of family dinners.In sum, Reichl can describe food like no other, and her experiences are interesting. I felt the book was a little too long, and I was disappointed by the superficial treatment of social issues. That said, the professional critics have been solidly positive: the New York Times called it \\"never less than fascinating,\\" and the Washington Post said it was \\"funny - at times laugh out loud funny - and smart and wise.\\" It's certainly worth taking a bite and seeing if you like the taste."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I stumbled upon Ruth Reichl a few years ago with her first novel \\"Tender to the Bone\\" and loved her. While I wasn't as wild about her second book \\"Comfort me with Apples\\" this lastest of her releases has me a raving fan again. She is funny, and candid and allows a bit of voyerism into a life some of us think we might want. Be prepared for a laugh, and a little educating on the New York Restaurant scene."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's \\"Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise,\\" centered around the author's work as a restaurant critic for The New York Times. Knowing that restaurants would go out of their way to make her eating experience as wonderful as possible, Reichl had to resort to disguising herself when she went to the restaurants that she wanted to review. She hoped to give her readers as accurate of a review as possible.I enjoyed this book immensely as it is highly entertaining to see the author disguised herself and the restaurants had no idea who she was at all. This book provided an insight look into the life of a restaurant critic for one of the more prominent newspapers in the country. It was not as easy as one would think due to the free meals in posh restaurants but Reichl showed that there were politics involved when it came to reviewing restaurants. In addition, I like that Reichl provided some recipes for her readers which didn't seems too difficult to make. I like this book a whole lot better than Amanda Hesser's \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte: A Food Lover's Courtship, with Recipes\\" which was more impersonal and the recipes too impractical. I highly recommend this book as it is fun and witty!"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Who doesn't dream of being someone different every now and then? In Garlic and Sapphires, Ruth Reichl shares her forays into the world of alter egos as she strives for anonymity while preparing restaurant reviews for The New York Times. She uses a diverse array of disguises, and creates stories and personalities for each one. Her alter egos allowed her to get an \\"everyman\\" experience at a restaurant instead of the red-carpet treatment, and she wrote her reviews accordingly. Also refreshing was her introduction of a wider variety of ethnic restaurants into the vaunted Times reviews. Each section packages up a restaurant and a persona along with some personal insights.I thought this book would probably be interesting, but I had no idea I would have such a hard time putting it down. Reichl's writing is humorous and flows well. Her food descriptions are vivid and truly mouth-watering. She really captures not just the food, but also the essence of the dining experience. Meals are not just fuel for the body; they also feed the soul. An entertaining and easy read, Reichl leaves you hungry for seconds."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I had half of this book left when I had to report for jury duty and, though my choice was unintentional, I could not have had a better companion to fill a day of waiting and boredom. When Ruth Reichl decided to become the restaurant critic for the New York Times, she had to give up a sunny, relatively anonymous way of life in California to become one of the most watched-for faces on the culinary circuit. In an effort to do her job well, Reichl not only had to develop a thick skin, but also a number of different characters to play (with full costumes and personalities) when doing her research. These discoveries and transformations not only impact her relationships - especially poignant are those with her young son, Nick - but also her understanding of herself from commune to critic.Having written for perhaps the most venerable newspaper around, I expected the quality of Reichl's writing to be good. Her style is easy and inviting, and instead of pictures we are given sporadic reviews that appeared in the Times and some of her own enticing recipes. Reichl appreciates food in ways that most of us could only imagine, but as readers we are indiscriminately brought into this world. The mere sight of a mushroom on my plate makes me nervous, but I was still able to enjoy these restaurant tales as though I had a broader palate. Perhaps this book is not for the true connoisseur, but for those of us who enjoy good food, good wine, good company, and a good story . . . or if you find yourself stuck on jury duty, this is a fun read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"\\"New York is the centre of the American restaurant world.\\" And a job at the New York Times as its new restaurant critic could potentially make nervous wrecks of anyone, never mind the new upstart from California, home of veggie burgers and tofu salads. But New York throws out the welcome mat. Even before Ruth Reichl arrives, there are \\"wanted\\" posters of her in nearly every restaurant in the city, as well as substantial \\"bounties\\" for spotting her. So much for anonymity! Now how is \\"the most important restaurant critic in the world\\" to get her job done?With the help of wigs, makeup and vintage clothes, Reichl morphs into Molly, Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily, fooling every sharp-eyed waiter and restaurateur in the city. Her personas are hilariously funny even as her reviews are mouth-wateringly delicious. Unlike the previous critic Bryan Miller with his penchant for French, Italian and Continental establishments, Reichl is an equal opportunity critic - dining and reviewing even Asian, Indian and Latino restaurants, leading her readers into hitherto unknown territory of the city's culinary map.I admit to being a fan after reading her earlier novel \\"Comfort Me With Apples\\". And I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" which not only has some of her best restaurant reviews and recipes from her own kitchen but also anecdotes of her life in New York and her time at the paper."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"During the 1990s, Ruth Reichel was the restaurant critic for the New York Times. When she began the job, she realized that a majority of the restaurants she would be reviewing knew what she looked like and were on the lookout for her. Therefore, she created a number of disguises for herself using clothing, wigs, and makeup. I highly recommend this book for an enlightening look at how Ruth's costumes changed the way people treated her as well as the effect on Ruth herself.I found it intriguing how Ruth took on other personalities almost without trying to. When she dressed as her mother she found herself ordering the foods her mother liked, and criticizing and returning foods to the kitchen as her mother would. My favorite character was Brenda. She wore a long and oddly scruffy carrot red wig that made her look rumpled and sleepy as if she had just climbed out of bed. She wore bright colored clothing, large colorful eyeglasses, and lipstick painted on bigger than her own lips. The way people treated her was different and wonderful. They smiled at her and talked to her. They wanted to spend time with her. They wished her well. Ruth states \\"Brenda was my best self, the person I've always wanted to be. She was generous and funny, optimistic and smart. She was kind. I hoped that finding the Brenda inside me would not always require a wig.\\" See the end of this review for Ruth's comments during an interview about wearing disguises.I also loved Ruth's artistic and sensual descriptions of food. Personally, I am not into food and I cook as little as possible. So I was surprised that I was entertained with her eating experiences and her knowledge of food. Some examples follow.P 86 regarding oysters. She said \\"You can't eat these. They've been out of the water too long. See how dry it is? An oyster should have abundant liquid in the shell. See how dull it is? When an oyster first comes out of the water, it is shiny, luminescent. It looks like this moonstone. But the longer an oyster is out of the water, the duller it becomes. This, as you can see, has no shine at all.\\"P 60 regarding a japanese noodle restaurant: \\"It takes a magician to make soba. They are made of buckwheat, which has no gluten. That means that getting them to hold together is an act of will.\\"More than once during this book I thought about truth being stranger than fiction. For example, Mr. Shapiro purchased a dinner with the author through a charity fundraising auction. He bragged to her that he always insisted on being the last person out of the restaurant. Her dinner with him lasted six hours. He was a jerk in other ways as well. My first reaction was disbelief that someone like him even existed. Another item that surprised me was about a man who would not give any money to his wife but allowed her to purchase as much clothing as she liked. Therefore, she frequently purchased two of each article of clothing and would give the second item to a consignment resale shop.There is an interview with the author at the end of the audiobook, which does not appear in my paper version of the book. In that interview, the author discusses several topics, one of which follows. I've done some editing for length and clarity.\\"When I first started wearing disguises, I thought it was about being anonymous and that it was all about the job, but as time went on I began to see that it's very hard to pretend to be someone and not be that person. People react to what you look like and you yourself begin reacting to how people react to you. I found being in disguise was a way of connecting with myself in a way that I hadn't anticipated. It was also a way of seeing how important (pause). You know, we always say don't judge a book by its cover and it's only the surface, but the truth is that it is more than surface deep. I started thinking how important clothes are and the way that when you're a little girl you make these choices about what you're going to look like and how important it is every time you cut your hair. You're making these decisions and thinking about what it is that people are going to think of you. The surface that we present to the world is very conscious, even when we think its not. We're always thinking about who we are in the world. Our clothing choices and our hair choices and our makeup choices are all saying to the world this is how I want you to see me, and the world really does see you as the way that you present yourself.\\"Setting: 1990s New York area.

It was educational and at the same time highly entertaining. There are several themes going on in the same book. First there is the actual review of restaurants and education of food and wine. Second, there is the truth about restaurants, food, and service that is exposed. Finally, there is the journey of the author and what she learns about herself, desires, and needs. All three themes are woven seemlessly to make a highly fun book to read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth's description of the lift of a restaurant critic was both a fascinating read and mouthwatering at the same time. Her descriptions of the disguises and deferring treatments in New York's finest restaurants made for a quick page turner. Her recipes and reviews scattered in each chapter made me both want to eat out more often and try to cook some of those dishes myself."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl has an inspiring taste for food. Reading Garlic and Sapphires is almost as wonderful as just tasting it. She knows how to describe things and it makes it like the reader is actually there. You can feel her fear, anxiety, and excitement. She has a peculiar connection with food. Yet her whole experience is simply delicoius. For example she describes sashimi as soft and luxurious, but (you never know) some book just might say Oh! Just delicoius! and BOOM thats it. But Ruth Reichl just throws you in the book and you experience the foods with her. This book is a must- read for all ages! It is even good for an eleven year old (like me)!

Still worth reading, though."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I decided to buy this book after hearing an interview with Ruth Reichl on CBC. It was the first book I've read by her and definitely the last. Yes, it was interesting to read about the different treatments she received based on perceived social status; however, I found it rather too much when she was \\"becoming\\" a different person, timid or obnoxious, as soon as she put different clothes on and a wig. Also, after a few chapters, I started getting a little annoyed with her constant \\"I found myself saying\\". There are also remarks in the book of how Mrs. Reichl finds New York people rude; ironically I found her character (her real character) rather pompous as she rarely had anything good to say about others but plenty of criticism."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"The book might be fabulous but I will never know as I want to purchase the digital edition. However, the digital edition is more expensive than the soft cover version or the hard cover version. That seems ludicrous and unjustified and I will not be purchasing this book. Also, 13$ for a book which is a few years old? Why?"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I preferred Tender at the Bone and Comfort me with apples. Reichl does describes the meals to make you feel as if you were there eating with her."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"This book left me feeling like I consumed too much, uncomfortable and wondering why I spent so much time doing it. It's a little interesting in the way that it's a little interesting to know what Paris Hilton is saying and doing. In fact it may be exactly the same as reading this book. The author is good at describing food but not that wonderful at making the stories involving. Her fascination with herself bleeds into bizarre as she dons disguises at various times. I found her reviews and the peek at the underbelly of the New York Times fairly intriguing. However, the uncomfortable feeling comes from my understanding of how the privileged in this country have taken conspicuous consumption to obscene levels and we all become participants by glorify them. I don't want to know any more about Paris Hilton or read any more food orgies thank you very much."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Maybe it's not such a good idea to have the author read her own book aloud. Ms. Reichl is a much more talented writer than reader. I found her delivery so nasal and monotone and gasp--Boring! that I didn't even finish the first disk. Now I shall go in search of the book to read myself as it does promise to be interesting. Just not read aloud by the author please."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Reichl is a knowledgable food critic and a talented writer, however I was uncomfortable with her use of alter egos to get restaurant reviews. Her disguises went far beyond seeking anonimity; her true personality quirks were allowed out of their cages, where they normally are housed in polite society. Most of this was harmless, although there were times when she became quite catty. She belittled a person who had purchased her dining companionship for the benefit of charity. Even though the person was a bore, it was her duty to see the evening through without compaint, or she should have never auctioned herself off. I would have expected her to set some ground rules for the evening, rather than letting herself be abused (restaurant choice, length of the committment, etc.),then becoming resentful. It would have been easier for her to write the charity a check and excuse herself. On another occassion she dressed vampishly and led a man on. She was married and deceived a gentleman over the possibility of a deepening relationship, even though she paid for her own dinner. Her husband was uncomfortable with the deception, as was I.This book is a display of Reichl's self-absorbed, brattish behavior. Her reviews were fair and even inspired, however her behavior was not."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I enjoyed Reichl's previous two memoirs, so when I spied this third memoir on the new books shelf at the local university library, I seized it. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its intriguing premise of her as a critic in disguise. She does discuss the first \\"undercover\\" meals of each persona, but she doesn't follow up on them. Apparently, the restaurants discover her alter egos so she creates new ones. But how do they do that? Does she always eat undercover? She doesn't answer many questions. I like her brief discomfort with the homeless man on the bus begging for food; she feels badly and gives him her leftover $100 doggy bag. But then (despite still feeling guilty about being paid to eat extravagant meals when many in NYC are homeless and hungry) she writes a lame column somewhat touching on the issue and then we never hear about it again. Was her guilt in reviewing food that many can't afford to eat part of the reason why she resigned? We don't know because she drops it. And what about the crusade against her by the previous food critic? It bothered her enough to mention it in the book and to use his real name, but after she discovered the nasty letters written about her, she drops it. Wasn't she angry? What happened? Something happened since she worked in the same area as the grumpy ex-food critic. This book just didn't meet the standards of her two previous memoirs, which are funny and well-written. This one had many passages devoted to her recipes and long descriptions of eating food (a salad became a forest, a fish the whole ocean, etc.) which is understandable since she is a critic, but I'd like to know: a) do people other than foodies really enjoy that food? Most of it sounded absolutely horrifyingly disgusting to me and b) do wealthy people go there to enjoy the food or just to enjoy the fact that they are wealthy? I can't imagine that having $100 million suddenly makes you love sauteed goose liver with fish eggs (ick) when what you really like is Kraft Mac N Cheese mixed with Starkist tuna (water-packed)(yum!). And how does she stay thin? It sounds as if she eats about 10,000 calories a day. These are the questions my inquiring mind wanted to know."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected to read more about the inner workings of NY restaurants, not recycled reviews from the New York Times. I thought it would be interesting to read about how she fooled restaurants with her various disguises. I did not expect to read page after page of where she bought the wigs, how she found the clothes, etc. etc. You can only read \\"the tastes exploded in my mouth like hundreds of little fireworks\\" (not a true quote from the book) so many times before you start skipping over the reviews. Save yourself some money and read the actual restaurant reviews from the Times' archives. I wish I had."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Riechl has a way with words when it comes to food.

My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine! But more surprisingly, I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many \\"characters\\". The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC's \\"best\\" restaurants. Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review. A very easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl uses words to describe food the way Van Gogh used paints to describe a starry night.

Prior to her, Mimi Sheraton and Brian Miller, good writers and critics, had held the post. Reichl brought restaurant criticism to a new level. Her reviews took into account not only the food, but also the treatment she received by the waitstaff, and also who the other clientele of the restaurant was. She would often comment on the \\"ooh\\"s\\" and \\"aah's\\" from the table next to her reacting to the food.In order to avoid being recognized (her appearance is distinctive, with a round face, wild dark hair, and strong, hadsome features) she would disguise herself. This book is a behind-the-scenes look at how she arrived at the different personas that she used to hide the real Reichl when she went out to eat. Some actors I've seen should be so thorough. Included at the end of each chapter (each a different dining Reichl) is the reprint of the review she wrote after dinng there as the character.If you enjoy fine dining, or reading about food, and especially if you've never read her writing, you'll love this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"I approached this most recent creation of Ruth Reichl with a degree of skepticism.

I will say that if you enjoy a quick paced book about human nature, human interactions, high society with twists of humor, insight and poignancy, this is the book for you.

It's as good as going to dinner with her"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl's passion about food could have made her the sort of irritating foodie snob that she skewers in \\"Garlic and Saphires\\" or the sort of ethnic restaurant evangelist who forgets that a dingy location in a dodgy part of town can ruin a meal as much as bad service or overcooking. Thankfully she seems to blend the two together on her crusade to be a \\"spy in the house of food.\\" Reichl proves that there is so much of social hierarchy and belonging to a tribe when one dines out that it is possible to have a completely different experience simply because you don't look like every other patron in the restaurant. There were some truly inspired moments in the book such as her meal at the Four Seasons where she dressed up as her late mother and got treated like a celebrity. Her moving conclusion was that life is too short not to treat yourself well, once in a while. Her son's reactions to his food at high-priced steak houses and the maitre D's reactions to her son were classic. As a new parent, I feel apologetic bringing my child out to a restaurant, but as long as they are well-behaved, I wonder why I should have to after reading that. I agree with other reviewers that remarked that this \\"memoir\\" was a tad unbelievable at times. Whole swaths of dialogue come off as faked and her childhood memories seemed to have taken on a bit too much of the shine of nostalgia. Still, the book reads fast, like a peculiarly structured comic novel. The recipes are a nice touch and though I am skeptical about a few of them (the Risotto for example assumes you already know how to make it), I might try the cheese cake just because Reichl is correct in asserting that every cook should have it in their repetoire."},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","review":"Ruth Reichl is an excellent writer and the story is compelling.

Reichl also places much value in her reviews on the way that people are treated, despite their age or looks, in a restaurant. We find that this is hard to come by in New York.

Throughout the book, the author continuously presented a verbose description of her dining experiences at a particular restaurant, and then followed it up with a rewrite of the same scene(s) within her reviews. I enjoyed reading the account of her first dining experience and subsequent restaurant review, but found myself skimming the reviews after the second or third restaurant assignment.I felt the same way about the author's belabored creation of and performances in her disguises.

A waste of trees to print complete non-inspired, non-interesting rubbish.The female lead had the intelligence of an 8 year old, and was too scared to speak when asked, then had to endured the consequences of knowing what really happened, but being too scared to speak to it to her loving husband and straigten it out within the first 5 mins, instead, - we get this extrememly basic contrived soap opera conflict - and boy, WAS IT BORING AND TEDIOUS.When yes, after about 400 pages, she actually does stop licking her lips, biting her nail, and lay the deal straight to hubby, this should really be 13 yrs old teenie fiction.Not adult fiction. it was so embarrassingly trite and childish, I will never read one of her books again, what a scammy author.She must think her readers are so stupid, that we'd take this juvenile rubbish, read it and like it and buy more of her books?Nah, GOING TOO FAR was so bad, I'm ashamed to have stuck with it, on the hope that \\"it may get better towards the end\\". It didn't.Bin this book if you have it, you'll embarrass your mates by sharing it with them, its THAT bad."},{"Title":"The Crying Heart Tattoo: A Novel","review":"Having read all of Martin's other novels, I was surprised by the nature and content of this phenomenally well written book.

It was one of the first paperback issues. I read the book once and it has stuck in my mind all these years. I love the cover with the crying heart. I'm not a 'tattoo' person, but I wanted a tattoo of the heart. This was in 2000 that I finally got my tattoo. I searched for this tattoo or something similar in at least 10 tattoo parlors in Dallas. DID NOT find anything close. I had cut the front cover off of this book so I could show someone what I wanted and finally found someone that free handed it for me. I love my tattoo and have carried that book cover in my billfold from that day on. I also have a lover 20 yrs. younger and this tattoo is for him. Our story is similar, but different. He was 30 and I was 50. But the feelings are the same.I would love to find a paperback book with this cover, but they don't seem to publish it anymore.

His wonderful technique of alternating narrative and storytelling between every other chapter and keeping all of it in harmony is impressive; the details and photographic memory akin to no one. I especially love the honest dialog between Sonny and Felicity as well as their crazy, sexual and forbidden adventures.

Good choice. It's real literature, and now back on the shelf to stay. I disagree with all those who think it's &quot;about&quot; love or relationships -- like all true art, it's not &quot;about&quot; one thing. It has a sort of bleak world view (some might say), but it's honest, real, and reminds us to enjoy the journey, because that's all there is.

As time goes on and I think back to this book I love it more and more.This is the story of Felicity and Sonny.....life-long lovers with a turbulent and sometimes downright heartbreaking relationship. Felicity, 20 years Sonny's senior, is brazen and even loopy at times. She lends a great deal of humor to the story as well as veiled sadness.Sonny, on the other hand is a huge jerk throughout most of the story as he becomes more and more bitter and jaded. Felicity seems to be the only spark left in his life...a spark which he almost puts out.Running parallel to the story of Sonny and Felicity is the tale of Gravelda and Genipur. They are two rather primitive tribal people who are hauntingly similar to their modern-day counterparts. It's a story that Felicity tells to Sonny in chunks over the years as their meetings become fewer and farther between. The story allows Felicity to quietly vent her feelings about her relationship with Sonny.This is a book that, even if you become a little dazed about in the process of reading, will stick to you long after you've read the last page. Far be it from me to withold credit where credit is due....and I must admit, this book is a jewel."},{"Title":"The Crying Heart Tattoo: A Novel","review":"A haunting, beautiful love story, with one of the most heart-wrenching last paragraphs I've ever read in a book. there is a genuine magic in this tale. sonny has much to learn from felicity, but he's stubborn, clueless, and thinks he has all the answers, like many of us when we're young, and the lessons he learns from her take years to absorb. and in any tale of love and regret he really learns them too late. felicity's parable is a delight, but lost on sonny. sometimes we don't realize how good we have it, until it's gone. sentimental, but not overly so. this is a book to be treasured, and read again and again.

I had heard rave reviews and was prepared to read a compelling love story. I was sorely disappointed. The author sets up the female character to appear confident, worldly and strong, yet he has her act weak and pathetic. Her so-called backround was unbelievable when compared to her actions. I never felt an unbreakable bond between the two characters. The writing was obvious in some instances with too many cutsey lines repeated a bit too often. The ending felt tacked on, as if Mr. Martin just ran out of story.

Only the most ignorant of novices could possibly be duped into thinking this is any sort of advanced penetration manual (Even the term \\"Uberhacker\\" is outdated vernacular from 1996).While the intent to disseminate hacking knowledge to the unwashed masses is certainly an admirable one, the cautious reader is better off taking some programming and administration classes and perhaps picking up a copy of Hacking Exposed."},{"Title":"Uberhacker II: More Ways to Break into a Computer","review":"I guess if you are reading books about hacking , .

Meinel, and I did. I am not terribly proud of it, since somehow the rough copy ended up there unrevised. But that's done and I must live with it. Furthermore, I was not paid for that work, and did not request any payment.Uberhacker is not a terribly good book, but it isn't as bad as some make it to be either. It is more of a primer designed for absolute beginners, something to get a kid started and interested, with just enough information to get you into trouble - information that is available on the Internet, in a thousand pieces everywhere - and importantly, a book that does take a great deal of care in keeping you out of trouble, or at least warning you about its potential impact on your life. It is THAT information, one rarely attached with what you can find on the Web, that adds solid value to it.Any 10 year old can find hacking how-to's if interested in the topic, and will probably get them from the same reviewers here that start with \\"Carolyn is well know in the hacking community...\\" and go one calling the author an incompetent fraud (unusually kind words from people used to a much cruder vocabulary).Carolyn P. Meinel isn't a fraud or a bad writer. While her intentions often exceeds her resources, she pulls a competent cataloguing and vulgarization job here, keeping the above in mind. She is careful about what she writes, and how she writes it. Giving youngsters Uberhacker may be the better alternative: It will not land anyone in jail.What Meinel has, however, is a 20 years talented history of making enemies in the black hat hacking community, a vindictive and vengeful group if there was ever one. A quick web search will show you what kind of mud slinging these guys have done elsewhere.

This lady is either incompetent, a crook, or both. This book is poorly written, has no flow, difficult to read, and gives the reader little information worth retaining.

This book assumes no prior knowlege, and explains things in detail, from the ground up. If you want a book that is perfectly organized, get &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot;.

Of course, you could try astalavista and many places to get more information, but no one can say that this isn't a generally good overview and detailed introduction to a fascinating subject.

Women therefore find themselves needlessly impeded in their daily lives.If women want to be taken seriously at work, then how is the wearing of sexy and revealing clothing to work going to help? Most men are scared of a sexual harassment lawsuit, so women need to find a way to tell male co-workers that they will not be offended by compliments on a new suit or hairstyle. Talking too much can be deadly to one's chances for promotion. Before making an oral presentation in front of others, have a critical friend spot-check you. Be organized, don't waste time and stick to the point. Be more goal-oriented in the language that you use.When dealing with office politics, create and maintain allies, and remember that friendship and friendliness are two very different things. If you are the victim of office sabotage, the most important thing to do is confront the saboteur. Otherwise, you are giving them a green light to continue. Do not confuse confidence with inflexibility or stubbornness; you do not have to win every time. Resist the temptation to cover your office wall with college diplomas, plaques and certificates. Have a male friend grade your handshake from \\"too limp\\" to \\"bonecrusher.\\"This is an excellent book. It doesn't ask to women to change who they are, but to realize that there are things women do every day that drive men nuts (not in a good way). Changing those behaviors will help women to prosper in their personal and professional lives.

Charles' Irish-American spouse Kate accompanies her beloved mate. However, her efforts to become a successful Baroness lead to her miscarriage and inability to have children any longer. Concerned about Kate's mental state, Charles takes her on a vacation in the coastal town of Rottingdean, just outside Brighten.When the distraught couple arrives at the vacation hot spot, a coast guard is killed and a second death shortly follows. The Prince Regent orders Charles to investigate the two killings. Very quickly, the married couple concludes that most of the townsfolk are engaged in illicit smuggling with the contraband stored beneath the city. However, the activities go way beyond the local level as they threaten the health of the entire empire.DEATH AT ROTTINGDEAN is a mesmerizing story line that has seemingly endless excitement. Set in late Victorian England, readers glimpse a country still struggling with the impact of the industrial revolution. Science and technology seems to advance at a rate similar to today's information technology revolution. Still, the old class system remains viable and alive. Robin Paige provides fans with an excellent historical mystery that will have genre fans searching for the previous four fabulous novels in this special, one-of-a-kind series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"Loved the story , maybe I am being biased for I am lucky enough to live in Rottingdean.

Great read for the Summer or a seaside holiday."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"I love this series. Not only are the stories well told but I love how the books include real authors from the period in the story lines. This is usually done with fairly minor characters but Rudyard Kipling plays a major role in this book. The books are also very well researched and in this particular book I learned a great deal I had never known before about the smuggling that went on in England. These mysteries are also very family friendly. I would recommend them to anyone."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"I can be a binge reader. I discover a new author I like, and go on a tear to read every book in a series, perhaps every book the author wrote. I'm currently lost in the historical mysteries of Robin Paige (which is a husband-and-wife team... if they're going to be open about that, why have a nom de plume?), set in 1890s England, most of which have a few \\"real\\" people in at least walk-on parts. What's not to like?The first book in the series,Death at Bishop's Keep, set up our characters: American Kate, who writes mysteries under the pseudonym Beryl Bardwell, and Lord Charles Sheridan, who is fascinated by newfangled forensic science (wow, fingerprints!) and a rather serious photographer. It's obvious from the first that they're meant to be together. By this point, in book 5, Charles has inherited the family estate and responsibilities, and the couple is exhausted by London. So they take a holiday in the seaside town of Rottingdean... where NATURALLY there is a dead body, and NATURALLY (with an entirely plausible reason) Charles and Kate must discover whodunnit. Our real-life characters are Rudyard Kipling and his family, including Aunt Georgina Burne-Jones (an independently-minded woman and active socialist, tied to the William Morris school).I liked Death at Rottingdean. I like all these characters. I didn't make the right guesses in regard to the mystery, which is always a good sign, too. Especially, I appreciate the historical detail -- even when it isn't pretty. We get a glimpse at the uncomfortable bits of Victorian life, for instance, when the dead man's widow learns she must leave her home; Aunt Georgie's socialist suggestions seem harsh even though the character is well-meaning. It's a reminder that not all of Victorian life is silk dresses and upper-class holidays.Somehow, this book wasn't quite as page-turning as earlier books in the series. Maybe it's because I'm less familiar with Kipling-the-person than I was with Beatrix Potter (inDeath at Daisy's Folly); it might be my own distractions (how DARE my real life interfere with my reading?!). I liked the book; I didn't swoon over it. That won't stop me from grabbing the next book in the series, though, because I absolutely want to know what derring-do Charles and Kate take on next."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"This is an excellent addition to the Kathryn and Charles series. In this book we find out about another aspect of Victorian England - smuggling and other nefarious schemes. There are actually two storylines in this book, and the authors deal with both of them very well. They certainly keep their readers interested. I like the obvious research that goes into each one of these books, and the totally different view that we are given about life in England just before the turn of the last century. The books are always enteratining and we get a history lesson too."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"I won't bore you with a recap of what was already stated so well by the reviewer Harriet Klausner. I do want to take the time to assure readers that in this delightful late Victorian era series attention to period detail is rivaled only by attention to excellent characterization, believable dialogue, honest settings, and strong plot. Buy the book, you won't regret the money spent."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"I enjoy this series because so much research is invested in them, and it shows. The authors manage to bring a great deal of historic detail to their work, bringing actual events into the story to make it more plausible. Here the author Rudyard Kipling and his family, including his aunt, the social activist wife of a famous painter, are introduced to the reader in the small town of Rottingdam. The actual town's history of smuggling activity is woven into a very plausible plot of murder and intrigue which is resolved by the sleuthing duo Lord and Lady Sheridan with the help of a small boy and the famous author.Although I usually have some difficulty divining the culprit because of the abundance of red herrings that twist through the plots of these works, I was already well on the culprit's trail this time. Knowing--or at least suspecting--the guilty party in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the work, however. As with any well crafted panopoly of characters and colorful settings, the \\"visit\\" is what makes the whole work worth while."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"At the end of the last book of this series, Sir Charles and his wife Kate were happily residing at Kate's ancestral home at Bishop's Keep. In the interval between that book and this one, Sir Charles' brother has died and the couple is now Lord and Lady Sheridan. Being the fifth Baron of Somersworth has placed a great deal of added responsibility on the couple's shoulders not the least of which is Lord Charles' seat in the House of Lords. While in London, the pregnant Kate ventures into the slums to aid in the care of the sick and becomes sick herself. Not only does Kate almost die but she also faces a far different future based on the permanent physical damage caused by the disease. Her feelings about this change in circumstances are bottled up inside as are the feelings of her husband and this background story ends up playing a large role in the plot as a whole.Lord Charles has promised Kate a holiday away from London where they can spend time together like they did before Charles inherited all of these new responsibilities. They head for Rottingdean, a little village on the Channel taking along only Amelia and Lawrence, their two most valued servants. They arrive just after the body of a Coast Guard has washed up on the beach, a death the local constable writes off as a suicide. Soon another Coast Guard is found shot and by a gun the likes of which Charles has never seen. Unfortunately for Charles, he is at a party with the Crown Prince when news of the second death arrives. Remembering the bang up job Charles had done in a previous investigation that saved the Crown a great deal of embarrassment, His Royal Highness put Lord Charles in charge of the case. So much for their quite holiday!Charles and Kate are soon hard at work and slowly they begin to uncover what seems to be a vast conspiracy. A conspiracy that at face value doesn't make any sense at all. They are aided immensely by a local boy named Patrick who knows far more than he is willing to tell at first. He is after all quite fond of some of the people who are very deeply involved in the conspiracy. I have a feeling that we will see more of Patrick in future books.Besides the Prince, the other historical figure who shows up in this book is the famous author Rudyard Kipling, who also aids the investigation a great deal. The appearance of these real people in this series adds a greatly to the stories as does the very realistic atmosphere. The authors are to be commended for their skill in story telling and their willingness to do a lot of research to make everything so believable. These stories are so realistic that while reading a previous book in which the characters must have drank gallons of tea, I started craving tea and had to break out the Earl Gray. In this book they drank lemonade and I ended up sending to the store for some of that. It takes a very talented storyteller to take a reader that deeply into a story. This is just a marvelously fun and suspenseful book that will keep you glued to it's pages from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"Kate and Charles Ardleigh take what they hope will be a relaxing vacation in the small coastal town of Rottingdean. But after two Coast Guards are murdered, the Prince of Wales sends them to investigate. It doesn't take long before they realize that smuggling in involved.

It's not too preachy, lots of atmosphere, and the suspense doesn't let up! Just great."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"I loved it. Fun characters and very interesting story line. By the end of the book you feel you reallyknow these people and miss them. That is when I download another of her books with the samecharacters. Her stories always have an historical plot to them.

This particular episode, however, was not my favorite. Having said that, giving her four stars is like giving someone else ten. I learn so much about rural England from these books...it's not just about the mystery, which is very good, but how people lived. I have not experienced a false note in her writing. I have read Rudyard Kipling but never anything about him (except in college texts) and it was fun having him in the story. She is my go-to 'get-away' author when I need my reading 'nest', a cup of coffee after a long day, and blessed quiet time. How sweet to read about manners and values and consideration of others even within the confines of a murder mystery. Excellent cozy series."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"An excellent book in this series from Robin Paige. The tunnels were interesting history inre: WWII. I have followed these characters from the first book."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"This is the sixth in a series of cozy mysteries written by a husband and wife team under a pseudonym. Set in Victorian England, they are well-written and well-researched. Each book has historical person or event that is intertwined in the storyline, making it of particular interest to those who enjoy their history. The historical notes found at the end of the book delineate the author's reasons for the inclusion of that person or event. Replete with period detail and the social mores evocative of a bygone era, this is a series of historical mysteries that is well worth reading.Lady Kathryn and her husband, Charles, now the Baron of Somersworth, are taking a much needed holiday at Rottingdean, a quaint seaside village that used to be known for its smuggling proclivities. Their days of rest and relaxation are numbered, however, when the body of a coast guard is discovered on the beach. They soon suspect that the old smuggling trade may not have gone quite out of fashion and that the townspeople are not so ignorant of what is really going on. With the aid of their friend, an author named Rudyard Kipling, Kathryn and Charles are intent upon setting to right what has gone terribly wrong in Rottingdean.The main characters are engaging, and with each passing book, the reader becomes more fully engaged with their lives. As with all cozy mysteries, it is not so much the mystery that is of import but the characters that revolve around the mystery. While the mystery is intriguing, it is simply the framework around which the characters evolve. This is definitely a cozy historical mystery series that is a must read for all those who enjoy this genre."},{"Title":"Death at Rottingdean","review":"This is the 5th book in the Victorian/Edwardian mystery series by Robin Paige (aka the husband and wife team of Bill Albert and Susan Wittig Albert). We meet Charles and Katherine on their way for a holiday from London to the small village of Rottingdean near Brighton. They have experienced tragedy as Katherine contracted measles during her pregnancy and has lost the child and her ability to bear children. The trip is so they can spend time together away from Charles' House of Lords duties that he took on after his brother's death. Rottingdean turns out not to be the sleepy village they were expecting and there is much mystery with a presumed drowing of a coastal agent and rumors of smuggling. Charles and Kate are put to work by the Prince of Wales on the case and are assisted by Rudyard Kipling. I enjoyed this one more than the previous book as it spent more time on the relationship of the main characters and had better atmosphere. Both characters believe the other has not accepted that they will not have children and this remains unresolved. Hopefully, the characters can move on from this tragedy and continue their strong relationship."},{"Title":"PC Upgrading and Troubleshooting QuickSteps","review":"I have been using computers for years, and have been getting frustrated for years.

There are a lot of noble ideals expressed here, but I have yet to see how they connect with the reality of the loosely confederated social club currently known as Mensa. This is like the corporate charters of most companies that I've worked for- meaningless boiler plate that nobody ever bothers to read._Like the \\"Delta's\\" in the movie \\"Animal House\\", all Mensa can really claim from my experience is \\"A long history of EXISTENCE to the community....\\"_The introduction by Asimov can be misleading.

The recipes were simple, tasty and foolproof.After many moves I lost the book and recently reordered a used copy. Now I'm finding the recipes get done way too soon even on the low setting. While they don't burn, the texture of the meat is ruined and unpleasant to eat. Perhaps crockpots have changed since those early days when they were introduced into homes.Try reducing the cooking time and using the low setting if you're going to let it go all day.

People's Almanac III, the final piece of the PA trilogy, is another book, along with The Book of Lists series, that is enjoyable and interesting. By the time this book came out it appeared that the authors were starting to rehash some of the material that was featured in the two earlier books of the series. I nevertheless consider this book well worth the money and a good read. Mr. Wallechinsky's interest and research pertaining to history, and the effort he made producing these books, was appreciated by me, and on behalf of those who read all three books, I would like to offer my gratitude. Anyone who has the desire to impress their friends as being an intellectual would be well served by reading these three books, as they serve as a crash course in history while being entertaining as well.

This is one of Hubbard's \\"air adventures\\", which I always enjoy. I can't help but wonder if maybe Hubbard himself didn't particularly enjoy this type of story as well. His descriptions of the aircraft and the aerial battles are always stunningly picturesque and Galaxy's cinema quality music and sound effects only serve to enhance Hubbard's storytellingThis is a great story with all the key elements that Hubbard uses so well. We have an aging pilot who is growing weary of making the same old run from DC to New York and New York to DC, day after day. He longs for a little excitement in his life, but in The Battling Pilot he gets a little more than he bargained for. And then there is the ever-present damsel in distress; this time in the form of an honest to goodness princess who must personally deliver a large sum of money to aid her desperate people. There is plenty of drama and high-flying suspense, along with Hubbard's wonderfully descriptive action scenes to spice up this fast-paced book.Steven Brandt - Audiobook Heaven"},{"Title":"The battling pilot (Classic fiction series)","review":"Filled with terror, excitement, kidnapping, and a case of mistaken identity, this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and guessing what will happen next, the whole way through.You can't help but feel bad for Pete England as he is tired of how routine his life has become, which has turned him into a tired, and moody person. Taking his anger out on everyone that crosses his path, Pete's life as he knows it is soon turned upside down. He quickly finds himself in the middle of a terrifying situation, all the while falling for a princess. Risking his life, as well as the life of his copilot, Pete becomes quite a brave man trying to save the princess and take down the man that is out to get her.The Battling Pilot was filled with suspense and excitement, and kept us guessing what was going to happen right up to the end. My son loved the gun fights, both in air and on the ground, and I loved that there was a love story amongst the action. The acting in this audiobook was also amazing, a well as the sound effects, as they really add to the emotion of this story. By far this was my favorite of the Golden Age Stories, as it has so much more to it than just the main plot, and kept me wanting more all the way to the end.L. Ron Hubbard did an amazing job writing this pulp fiction, and it made my son and me even more excited about the Golden Age Stories.

He is also considered to be at the center of the greatest controversy that concerned the relationship between religion and science, the so-called \\"Galileo Affair.\\"This short introduction aims to give a concise and representative view of Galileo's life, his important scientific discoveries, the popularization of science that he engaged in, and the controversies that all of his scientific activities had engendered. The book is written with an interested non-expert in mind, but it is neither simplistic nor does it skim over any of the most important historical or scientific facts.It is hard for the modern reader to truly appreciate how much about the motion, the world and our place in it we take for granted. Galileo has paved the way for many of the most fundamental concepts that have become cornerstone of the scientific worldview. He helped define and place on a solid experimental and conceptual foundation things like velocity, acceleration, gravity, and many others. This short book describes many of the experiments and observations that Galileo engaged over throughout his lifetime. Of particular importance is his invention of the astronomical telescope and the important discoveries that it enabled him to achieve, such as the mountains on Moon, satellites of Jupiter, and rings of Saturn.Over the centuries there has been a lot of scholarly (and not so scholarly) writing dedicated to the \\"Galileo Affair.\\" There has not been a clear consensus reached on even what really transpired at the actual trial, little less on the motivations of various actors and the impact that the Galileo's sentence has had on either Galileo himself or the relation between science and religion in general. It doesn't help that this incident has been appropriated over the centuries by all sorts of partisan viewpoints, and therefore it becomes almost impossible to take a dispassionate and objective view of the situation. A few things, however, are quite clear. The original opposition to Galileo's pro-Copernican viewpoints and the new astronomical discoveries that seemed to have supported it primarily came from philosophers and astronomers. Furthermore, even when the Catholic Church's authorities started to look into the controversy, the subjugation of science to religion had never been an issue. Anyone familiar with the Catholic Theology or many Catholic scientists and astronomers that either preceded or followed Galileo would admit as much. In fact, Stillman Drake argues in this short book that Galileo acted in the way he did precisely out of concern to put Catholic Theology beyond any present or future conflict with scientific discoveries. This is not a widespread opinion of Galileo's true motivations, and is certainly not something that could be claimed based on the written evidence alone, but Drake presents a very persuasive case. This viewpoint helps make sense of a few facts surrounding Galileo's trial that otherwise remain puzzling, such as Galileo's very cautious and gradual approach to the Copernican ideas and the close lifelong personal relations that he had with various bishops and cardinals. At the very least these are not the characteristics of an anti-religious zealot.Galileo is one of the most important figures in the history of science. He is also someone who has been for almost four centuries at the focus of a lot of controversy and misinformation. This little book goes a long way in clearing some of the misconceptions about Galileo and introducing the reader to the seminal achievements of this great man."},{"Title":"Galileo: A Very Short Introduction","review":"In this slim volume is packed the central thesis of one of the foremost students of Galileo:1) that Galileo was not a victim of the inquisition but rather the Aristotelean method of reasoning particulars of Science from theoretical ideas. Galileo thought that experience, measurability and prediction should be the guide. Grand ideas he left to the Church and philosophers. Perhaps he was a little too naive in assuming that the inquisition would leave him alone. But it was in the defence of Aristotle that the inquisition indicted him. Not mere religious intolerance (which of course there was plenty).The other observation was the in-fighting and jockeying inside the academic community for political and religious favour -- the competition for well-paying university seats was intense and Galileo was a direct victim of academics who ruthlessly pilloried him to gain favour.2) Galileo was no crusader directly challenging the power of the church. He in fact had many freinds as high-archbishops and even a was a personal friend of the Pope. His desire was never to challenge the church and the church only very reluctantly charged him with &quot;teaching&quot; the doctrine of Copernicus and Kepler.This is a great jumping off point for further studies on Galileo. I love this series."},{"Title":"Galileo: A Very Short Introduction","review":"It is not easy to write a better, very short introduction that Stillman Drake has done, here. While being absolutely packed with loads of information, Drake makes it accessible. This book will be intimidating to someone familiar with the watered-down nature of other introductions, but, having read half of Oxford's series, I think that the idea is that these books are intended to be scholarly approaches to introductions of the material. To put it simply, as an academic who is not familiar with many other disciplines, I have found Oxford's series to be quite useful. At any rate, Drake's work, presented in this book, I think, is so accessible that, even for the non-academic, a brief introduction to Galileo, such as the graphic novel variety, would suffice in one's preparation for reading this. That is to say, though a step up on difficulty, Galileo: A Very Short Introduction serves as a fantastic introduction to a subject, especially, in cases where the reader wants to know if the subject is one worth reading more into. As for me, not only will I be reading more into the subject, I have found it rather obvious that Stillman Drake is probably among the top, if not the top, scholar on Galileo.One thing definitely worth noting about this book is its interdisciplinary style. Drake does a wonderful job of conveying the science that is relevant to the history of science discussion, as it pertains to Galileo. Moreover, Drake does well to explain the importance of various philosophical aspects that impacted Galileo's science.Finally, I think the book was just well written. Drake has a definite writing style, and he has a flare, which really brings interest to his subject matter. He writes with clarity, and he writes in such a way that provokes thought. Probably, the best part of his writing is the way in which he words his thoughts, which is brilliant, in that he says so much in such a small book; not a sentence is wasted."},{"Title":"More Other Homes and Garbage: Designs for Self-Sufficient Living, Complete Revised, Expanded, and Updated","review":"While ageless classics exist, I must deduct one star per 25 year for technical manuals.

Now, while still being firmly on the fringe of our cultural norms (how many people actually build their own sewerage treatment ponds and methane digesters?)the technologies explained within are far more available nowadays.The book remains an excellent handbook for the keen DIY homesteader or self reliance practitioner. I love the home-made solar water heating schematics and examples. There could be more detail on dwelling design and construction, but since this topic is well catered for with loads of great books available, I will forgive it.And it has one of the grooviest book titles ever!

Perhaps a few of us were born into bluegrass, but most of us crossed paths with the genre somewhere along life's road. For journalist and photographer Stephanie Ledgin, it was July, 1975 when the young college graduate went to work as assistant editor of Pickin' magazine. She probably didn't know the difference between the Clinch Mountain Boys and the Clinch Mountain Clan. Or the Blue Grass Boys and Blue Sky Boys. But Ledgin did know that the music grabbed and moved her, and she then spent a couple years in Nashville. Besides Pickin', her work has also appeared in such publications as Bluegrass Unlimited, Acoustic Guitar, Sing Out!, and Bluegrass Now. Now, with nearly three decades of journalism experience under her belt, she has the background, facts and insight to educate today's bluegrass \\"newbie.\\" Her timing is good as the late-2000 release of the film \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" has created a resurgence of interest in the genre. She mentions the movie frequently throughout the book.Ledgin gives us an open-minded and objective assessment of bluegrass music, a fabric of our lives which is embedded in popular culture more than we consciously realize. At the same time, she concedes that it's still a \\"nonmainstream music.\\" Her approach is shared in an enthusiastic personal manner. She wants us to know where to listen to bluegrass, what some recommended albums are, and how to learn to play the music. After defining bluegrass and delving into its origins, the author describes how it has evolved over the years. She explains that the family tree of bluegrass is more like a \\"forest of tangled roots and branches.\\" Her paragraph descriptions of many bands and artists are good information, but, to a certain extent, they aren't presented chronologically which makes the logical historical threads a bit hard to follow. Ledgin then explores the various instruments of bluegrass.The repertoire of bluegrass is given a cursory discussion of its themes related to love, death, faith and family. Then, some background info about a few key songwriters is presented. Throughout the book, she also includes short interviews with various individuals associated with bluegrass (Ralph Stanley, Janette Carter, Earl Scruggs, Jim Lauderdale, Sierra Hull, John McEuen, Jeff Hanna, Pete Goble and others). The international bluegrass scene, concerts, festivals, jam sessions, workshops and bluegrass in the schools are discussed. Her \\"completely subjective\\" list of 25 recordings to jump-start your collection (along with a few videos) barely scratches the surface of the bluegrass cannon, but it offers solid selections. She also includes concise contact info (including Internet website addresses) for magazines, syndicated radio shows, record labels, instruction material, and key organizations. I wish she would've noted the on-line listservs Bgrass-l and the Nwbluegrass Yahoogroup. The 25 photos were all taken by Ledgin, and all but one have not been published previously. They span a period from 1982-2003.In an interview transcribed in the book, Ralph Stanley states about the importance of bluegrass in America music, \\"It's more down-to-earth. It tells a story; a lot of the songs do. It just fits all classes of people...Well, this type of music has not only reached the old people and the mountain people, it's gone out now and proved itself to the world.\\" That, in the words of one of bluegrass music's patriarchs, may simply be the best reason for the newcomer and established fan (whether a musician or not) to pick up a copy of this book and discover bluegrass. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now)"},{"Title":"Homegrown Music: Discovering Bluegrass","review":"The book is poorly organized and in general hard to read. More than a journey into the discovery of Bluegrass it is the journal of a Bluegrass insider who can easily list the who's who rather than explain what's what. If you passion is music, this is not your book.The historical part is interesting, but fails to captivate the audience. Similar recanting of the early days on the Web are free and a lot more captivating. Naturally, as the books become more and more dated, a lot of the references provided become outdated and so, it does not even serve as a reference book.I hope not to offend the author, but I would recommend you save you money and perhaps check if your local library can get you a copy."},{"Title":"Homegrown Music: Discovering Bluegrass","review":"This book serves as a good primer for anyone who has been bitten by the O Brother bug and wants to immerse him/herself more deeply into bluegrass music. While Barry Willis' America's Music: Bluegrass has served extremely well as the \\"Bible\\" of bluegrass information, its latest edition is dated 1997, and so much has happened with the music genre since then, especially since 2000.Unless one has access to another bluegrass fan, it can be difficult to learn of other artists, dedicated websites and publications, and specialized musical instrument instruction sources. Ms. Ledgin takes the attitude of \\"Okay, I've seen the movie, bought the soundtrack, I love it, now what?\\" to make it relatively easy for a recent bluegrass fan to further his/her education.The chapters are pretty much set up as expected. The first few discuss the history and background of bluegrass music, with emphasis on the pioneers. These are followed by chapters on prominent musicians and songwriters, the effect the music has on our culture, its international impact, and discussions on festivals, workshops, and the etiquette of parking-lot jamming. Most of these chapters contain a concluding interview with a notable bluegrass performer discussing relevant matters. Interviewees include Ralph Stanley, Janette Carter, Jim Lauderdale, Earl Scruggs, and The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The chapter on prominent musicians is concise but extremely useful. Here each instrument that plays a role in the traditional bluegrass band is discussed, with the three or four most popular players briefly examined, followed by a listing of other influential instrumentalists.The appendices prove to be quite valuable for research on bluegrass. The first, entitled \\"Twenty-Five Recordings to Jump-Start Your Collection,\\" may stir up some debate among aficionados, but surely stands as a good starting point. Most of the choices lean more towards traditional performers (the list does not include any albums from Nickel Creek, a band that has had a large impact on younger audiences), but does include some newer traditionalists such as King Wilkie. Also in this section is listing of useful and popular videos that cover different aspects of bluegrass music.The other useful appendix deals with all of the useful resources to learn more about the music genre that this book has only touched upon. This includes reference books, museums, publications, broadcasts (including Internet and satellite broadcasts), record labels, schools, and record and musical instrument retail outlets. Since this book is only a few months old, the mailing and web addresses are pretty much current.The text is pretty straightforward and easy to read, and generally gives only brief accounts of various subjects, allowing the reader to pursue further reading in other resources. A brief foreword by Ricky Skaggs serves as a nice touch to an overall enjoyable read for the bluegrass novice. While the price may be a bit steep for the individual, this book may prove to be a welcome edition to any organization or library wishing to provide a fantastic primer on bluegrass to its membership or patrons.

I'm an experienced guitar player, a budding mandolin player, and wanted to dig a little deeper into bluegrass. This, unfortunately, was not the book to read. There are no interesting stories here. The photographs are the kind you would see in any family's drawer of pictures not good enough to make it into the scrapbook.I'm going to keep hunting for a good, fun read about bluegrass.

What they show is Neville Chamberlain and his ministers in close detail, what they thought and why they thought it. This book achieves what it sets out to accomplish: it explains in careful detail the origins and practice of British appeasement in the run-up to World War II.The authors make two primary points, one obvious and one more subtle. The obvious point is that Chamberlain's government (and the Conservative Party more generally) was so eager to avoid another war that it simply ignored the abundant evidence that Nazi Germany was pursuing policies that were abhorrent to any constitutional democracy and that were bound to lead to another major European war. And in their ultimately unsuccessful effort to stave off war in Europe, there was virtually no step that Chamberlain's government would not take to attempt to mollify and curry favor with Nazi Germany.The more subtle point is that, as the decade of the 1930s progressed, and particularly after Munich, the Chamberlain government either removed from government or ignored dissenting voices, and it also began to conduct its diplomacy almost in secret, bypassing the House of Commons and public opinion to the fullest extent feasible. And the more the Chamberlain government and its ministers pursued a go-it-alone, hothouse mentality, the more it became isolated from public opinion. No wonder that Chamberlain was unseated in 1940; the surprise is that it didn't happen sooner.This sad story is all laid out it in great depth, literally on an hour-by-hour basis in the case of some of the major crises, such as Munich, and the Danzig negotiations of 1939. Beyond merely providing a chronology of these events, however, the authors provide the social and political context for the various events as they occurred, plus biographical sketches for some of the major actors within the Chamberlain Government.For any student interested in the origins of World War II, this is, quite simply, an invaluable book."},{"Title":"The appeasers,","review":"This book, out of print, but is important to the study of the period of time between WWI and WWII.

It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Castle's dismissal of early works on swordsmanship as \\"The rough untutored fighting of the Middle Ages\\" is unfortunate. I defy anyone to examine Sigmund Ringeck's Fechtbuch (as translated and interpreted by Christian Tobler in Secrets of German Medieval Swordsmanship) or the anonymous Manuscript I.33 from 1300 (translated by Jeff Forgeng in The Medieval Art of Swordsmanship and analysed by myself and Paul Wagner in Medieval Sword and Shield)and conclude that medieval fencing lacked system and sophistication.Also unfortunate is Castle's evident belief that the history of fencing is a process of steady improvement to the perfection of fencing in his day. It was a good thing for Castle and his contemporaries that they never had to face the trained killers of the middle ages and see their \\"rough untutored\\" fighting for themselves.But, quaint 19th century notions of superiority aside, in his description of the fencing masters of the 16th-18th centuries, Castle is unsurpassed. He possessed the rare ability to separate observation from opinion. So, while his opinions may be...interesting, his observations, unsullied by opinion are for the most part accurate. He examined about a hundred different fencing masters and their systems in analyses that are sometimes deep and sometimes quite superficial.Other authors have attempted to write histories of fencing, but none have managed to separate their observations of the old masters from their personal opinions. Hence none are as useful as Castle. As old and as dated as this work is, it still deserves a place on the shelf of anyone interested in the history of swordsmanship.Stephen HandAuthor, Spada, Spada II,Medieval Sword and Shield"},{"Title":"Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)","review":"This is a very readable and enjoyable history of the evolution of the various &quot;schools&quot;(or philosophies)of self defence with the sword, expressed with a detailed look at their main proponents, the salon masters of years ago.Castle's personal sketches of the masters are enlightening and full of anecdotal material. The accompanying illustrations are mostly reproductions of period wookcuts which are invaluable in themselves.However, the poorly reproduced photographic addenda reveal that Castle was as much as a century off in his ability to identify and date sword types. This of course was not the purpose of his work.Even given this small flaw, I wholeheartedly recommend this for the fencer or martial artist of any level who is interested in the roots of the art. We are fortunate that Mr Castle provided us with such a good, solid history."},{"Title":"Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)","review":"Egerton Castle lays out a roadmap of European swords, schools and masters of the sword, and fencing texts from the middle ages to the early 1800s. Despite an original publication date of 1885, this is the best overview of the subjects covered. It is generally laid out in chronological order, with a few detours to follow specific schools of fencing, but flows well and logically. Castle describes the last days of armor and twohanded swords, and as gunpowder made medieval armor obsolete, he progresses through the development of the rapier and smallsword.I found the sections on Spanish and English schools of thought most useful, as these are most removed from modern sport fencing, and least accesible through modern authors (who have been heavily influenced by Asian, Pacific Islander, and other edged weapons arts, and their own theories). For example, Ramon Martinez is absolutely brilliant at explaining the Spanish school of fencing as he interpretes it, but he tends to gloss over shortcomings of Spanish Fencing, or John Clements, whose books make reference to parrying with the flat of the sword rather than the edge, which is without practical or historical basis.Castle's vignettes of personalities and events of fencing history add a charming 'gossipy' air to the work that make it very readable, when it easily could have devolved into an arid scholarly listing of unadorned facts and dates. The discussion of Domenico Angelo in England was a delightful snapshot of life among the upper class of England in that period.In a word, brilliant. \\"Schools and Masters of Fencing\\" does not claim to be a text on the management of l'arme blanche, but an overview of the history of the weapon. But with this disclaimer, Castle procedes to offer insights into the techniques and evolution of techniques that have become modern sport fencing. Although Castle does not dwell on it, this work offers great insight into the interrelationship of armor, muscle powered weapons, and firearms. The book neatly frames out the golden age of edged and pointed weapons from the time when the obsolescence of armor in the face of firearms made way for the most subtle and refined swordsmanship to the point where reliable repeating handguns made the sword a relic of a more refined but less democratic era.Absolutly top shelf; a 'must read' for a serious classical fencer or student of the history of arms.E.

I have to warn that this is not a fencing manual. True, there is a lot here about the evolution and development of fencing and therefore some examples are given, but this book does not teach fencing. Instead, it is a discussion on history of the science of swordsmanship. It focuses exclusively on Western Europe. Why there is not a single word on Eastern Europe and other parts of the world, I do not know.The book is quite interesting because it not only talks about fencing, but the people who studied and practiced it. It discusses the role of fencing masters in the wider society and how swordsmanship slowly changed its role from a tool of warfare and deadly duels to what is today just a sport.Nevertheless, I can't hide the fact the discussion often becomes technical. Time after time we read how Italians developed such and such guard or parry (or did not) and how it was learned and improved upon (or was not) by the French.

Sheri Tepper, probably still best known for her True Game series is one of my favorite fantasists. She has an artful way of combining humor, whimsy and drama into works that take frequent unexpected turns and have endearing casts.'Marianne, the Madame, and the Momentary Gods' is the sequel to 'Marianne, the Magus, and the Manticore,' which I read so long ago that I dare not attempt to remember it. But the heroine is Marianne, a young woman with surprising talents and assets that are coveted by Madame Tabiti Delubovoska, a very nasty witch who has a knack for catapulting her victims into bad places and doing away with anyone who gets in her way. When the Madame kills Marianne's parents and sets out after the young lady, Marianne escapes, and then doubles back on her history to try to set things right.And this brings us to the current volume, in which Marianne reawakens as a child and starts to relive her live, this time with the assistance of the previous Marianne and 5 dog-like Momentary Gods, who just might control reality. The Madame's attempt on Marianne and her parents is foiled this time. However, Marianne, a bit upset at discovering there are two Marianne's in her head, rebels and sets out to live her own life. Unfortunately, this leaves her vulnerable, and the Madame traps her in a world where nothing stays the same and one needs a new map every day. The Momentary Gods and Makr Avehl (her former lover) come to her rescue, but is will be an intense struggle and a very close thing.While the concepts that underlie the story are fairly complex, Tepper manages to avoid and gobbledygook in exercising our imaginations. The story is light and charming, perhaps a bit too much of an appetizer than anything else. Even so, the writer shows a talent for social satire in her depiction of the chaotic city. Tepper also makes sure that the reader understands that finding two minds in one body is no trivial thing. Although the story really should be read after it's predecessor, no harm was really done by my memory failure. Even after ten years this is a pleasing confection."},{"Title":"Marianne, the Madame, and the Momentary Gods","review":"This haunting book by Sheri S. Tepper draws me back year after year.

She starts her life over again and is transported to a new world with strange rules. This time five helpers/dogs/gods go with her with unique abilities of their own. A girl once abused and withdrawn learns how to live, fight, and trust.A person can get lost in the deep symbolism apparent in this complex, short novel.

Joe section has a short, but concise history of each of the various Joe action figure lines. The book averages 3 - 4 black & white pictures per page with some 2,100 plus pictures in all. There is also a 16 page color photo section.Testing the book out I didn't find many things that were not in the guide. One interesting omission was the Lord of the Rings action figures from Toy Biz based upon the recent films. Interesting because the book DID contain the older lines from Toy Vault and Knickerbocker toys. My only real disappointment was that in eight pages of Transformer toys listings there were only five photographs included. Heck you can easily find MIB pictures off the internet of most, if not every Transformer toy. OK, I guess that may be nit-picking just a bit. As will all Krause books the layout is very clean and well laid out. They don't sacrifice readability by making the type so small you can't read it like some other guides do. This is one book I always take along with me when I go out to flea markets or garage sales. Great as usual!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"The thesis of this book parallels that of George Marsden's similar book on American culture, Religion and American Culture, that Fundamentalism shaped and was shaped by the surrounding culture. Marsden builds upon the work of earlier historians of Fundamentalism, namely that of Ernest Sandeen's book The Roots of Fundamentalism: British and American Millenarianism. Sandeen's thesis is that Fundamentalism is the outgrowth of the \\"millenarian\\" movement that developed in late nineteenth-century American, especially through Bible institutes and conferences concerning the interpretation of biblical prophecies. Sandeen's thesis, according to Marsden, has much to commend it in connecting millenarianism and Princeton theology to the movement; however, it does not deal adequately with the militant anti-modernistic slant of the movement. Fundamentalism can briefly be defined as militant anti-modernist Protestantism that took on its own identity as a patchwork coalition of representatives of other movements.Overview of the BookMarsden divides his book into three sections (these sections are different in intent than the above themes. Marsden uses these sections to expand on his themes), Evangelicalism before Fundamentalism, the Shaping of Fundamentalism as a Movement, and the Crucial Years in which it gained popularity and its subsequent exodus of public life. In understanding the rise of Fundamentalism at the end of the nineteenth-century one must understand the backdrop from which it arose-nineteenth-century evangelicalism.ConclusionMarsden concludes the book by re-emphasizing his definition of Fundamentalism as a militant anti-modernist conservative force. For Marsden this should be the starting point for defining the movement. Militant anti-modernism applies to all types of Fundamentalism and any definition that goes beyond this must have qualifiers so that false stereotypes are not applied to the wrong group. As an Evangelical I enjoyed this book as I saw where the mind-set of conservatives and liberals developed. I also learned to what extent my own beliefs were influenced by this movement. I suggest that this book be read alongside another book on the shaping of American Christianity for a full understanding. I would also like to see an analysis of Fundamentalism from a more mainline perspective, although I believe Marsden is objective in this work. My main qualm with this book is in Part Three. In discussing the peak and soon-to-come fall of Fundamentalism, Marsden tried to put too many ideas into too few words. To keep up with him I had to re-analyze several chapters. However, due to the length of the book already, I can understand his attempt to save space. I would recommend this book to people of all political and religious persuasions so that they may have a fair understanding of this branch of early twentieth-century American religion."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"George Marsden's biography of Jonathan Edwards was so well written that I decided to read more of his stuff. This book on fundamentalism is a classic. Many scholars of Christian fundamentalism paint with too broad a brush, often lumping evangelicals into the fundy camp. Marsden avoids this mistake. He also acknowledges what many do not, that the fundamentalism of the post WWI era took on a much harsher and more separatistic tone.Marsden does a nice of discussing some of the towering figures of the movement: D.L Moody, R.A Torrey, Arno Gaebelein, J, Gresham Machen, Jonathan Blanchard and Charles Blanchard (the President of Wheaton College). He shows how early fundamentalists like R.A Torrey and W.H Griffith Thomas thought that evangelical zeal should be coupled with social concern. Marsden also highlights the fundamentalist disdain over the more liberal Social Gospel, which jettisoned evangelism completely.We also get to see the fundamentalists like Billy Sunday and William Jennings Bryan, who were concerned about people coming to know Christ, but not quite as concerned about people coming to know more about the doctrinal content of Christianity. This was a major concern of the evangelical Princeton theologians (BB Warfield, Charles Hodge, and J. Gresham Machen).There is also a newer chapter in this edition that traces the development of fundamentalism from 1980 to the present day. In this chaoter, Marsden also takes himself to task for not discussing how the relaxed mores of the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" alarmed the fundamentalist community, nor did her mention the role of women in the fundamentalist movement of 1871-1925.But these criticisms duly noted, I still like the book very much and commend it to those interested in religious movements.Rev.

The fourth part- Interpretations- deals with scholarly understanding of the movement within American Chistianity called fundamentalism. I found this to be especially helpful, a careful synthesis and interaction with the most important scholarly work in this area. I also found it to be a good demonstration of how a christian can do &quot;history&quot; with scholarly integrity. In this part, he also gives some interesting authors worth looking at later, of which he interacts. The last two pages of the book, the Epilogue, is something of Marsden's philosophy of history, and how it relates to theology and faith. Again, very worthwhile, and something I will share with friends who also have an interest in Christians doing scholarly work in history, He is always fair and evenhanded. In my opinion, the book is soild throughout, and very readable. Yet I learned more from the last fifty pages than the preceeding chapters."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"I read this book for a class on the history of Fundamentalism in America. The book was an excellent resource, and it often provided interesting theories about the development of Christian Fundamentalism in America. I found the history parts to be fascinating, and the interpretation of the history to be not as fascinating. Marsden's opinions about the facts were helpful at times, but confusing at other times. As a conservative Christian, this is a history account from an insider's view. Of the three books that I am reading on the subject, this book is the best of the three."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"Fundamentalism is the movement arising among Christians in the early 20th century who fervently defended the fundamental doctrines of Christianity while opposing modernist liberalism. In his Fundamentalism and American Culture, George M. Marsden investigates the historical context and ideological roots of what came to be American fundamentalist Christianity, recognizing complex influences from nineteenth-century traditions like revivalism, holiness, and patriotism. Marsden says, \\"Fundamentalists were evangelical Christians, close to the traditions of the dominant American revivalist establishment of the nineteenth century, who in the twentieth century militantly opposed both modernism in theology and the cultural changes that modernism endorsed\\" (4). His interpretation of the phenomenon of fundamentalism treads a middle ground between those who reduce it to a purely social reaction to the emerging trend of modernist thought, and someone like Ernest Sandeen who views fundamentalism as essentially theological (201). Some evaluations from observers of the height of the fundamentalist frenzy saw it as hollow and brief; the Christian Century said in 1926, \\"it is henceforth to be a disappearing quanitity in American religious life, while our churches go on to larger issues...\\" (192). Marsden does not relegate fundamentalism to the position of a short-lived radical sect, but sees it as a significant movement with deep roots and continued relevance to today's American evangelicalism. As a result, he devotes about half of his book to in depth account of late 19th and early 20th century currents of Christian thought.Marsden focuses on three major themes. First, he highlights a tension within fundamentalism--the tendency at times to preserve the perceived identity of American culture (viewing America as Israel), and at other times to take on the identity of a separatist minority sect (viewing America as Babylon). Second, he studies the prominent movements of Christian thought in American evangelicalism before the emergence of fundamentalism. He sees deep roots in America's revivalism, pietism, the popularity of holiness, and middle-class Victorian values. Third, Marsden observes a wavering stance among fundamentalists regarding science and the intellect. On one hand, the scientific \\"common sense\\" type of principles of 17th century philosopher Francis Bacon allowed the average person clearly to see the plain facts of God evident in Scripture. On the other hand, this same scientific approach allowed proponents of Darwinian evolution to discard the unrealistic, supernatural, miraculous accounts found in the Bible. Naturalism and evolution were powerful enemies of Christians who wanted to maintain the fundamental supernatural tenets of the faith. Increasingly over the years, anti-evolution became a more unifying passion than even adherence to Christian orthodoxy. Marsden comments, \\"Many people with little or no interest in fundamentalism's doctrinal concerns were drawn into the campaign to keep Darwinism out of America's schools... The more clearly [fundamentalists] realized that there was a mass audience for the message of the social danger of evolution, the more central this social message became\\" (170).After chronologically recounting the origins of fundamentalism, its peak in 1920-1925, as well as the subsequent gradual growth of fundamentalist ideology through denominations and universities, Marsden shares his interpretation of the movement. Fundamentalism was initially a religious assertion against the threat of modernism, but the event of World War I gave fundamentalism crucial characteristics. War-related crisis provided an occasion for paranoia and militant defense of religious views. Marsden compares evangelicals experience of encroaching modernism to the \\"traumatic cultural upheaval\\" of cross-cultural immigration (204).I find quite helpful Marsden's reluctance to paint the fundamentalist movement as either purely theological or purely social. By resisting extremes, Marsden's eyes are open to the great and sometimes even contradictory complex issues informing fundamentalism. He says it is \\"a mistake to reduce religious behavior to its social dimensions\\" and admirably acknoweledges the power of spiritual forces and deep-seated convictions (203). I wish he had made some value judgments, even if tentative and qualified, and used a biblical standard to grant the reader practical ideas for how to move forth with knowledge of historical fundamentalism. What traps and misconceptions did fundamentalists fall into that contemporary evangelical may be vigilant to avoid? For what elements of fundamentalism can we be grateful and which can we even strive to emulate? This desire of mine, though, is just because I'm more interested in ideas than events. I prefer philosophy to history. People who love history may have more fun reading this than I did. Marsden's objectivity seems appropriate to a scholarly book in the genre of history."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"I used this book to get insight in background of R.A. Torrey, and it helped wonderfully. Espescially for me as a European theologian, it helped to get insight in history and society of the States, especially concerning the relation between pre-millenianism and cultural atmosphere and impact on theology, especially on the question of the personhood of the Holy Spirit!For European theology it gives an insight in the background of the more and more popular evangelical and pentecostal churches and their theology, that has its roots there, where this book is al about!Stefan R Timmerman"},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"I heard George Marsden lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary a few months ago and was sufficiently impressed to want to try one of his books. So I picked this one.This is not my field and I wouldn't know a dispensational premillennialist if I tripped over one, but for the most part I was able to follow Marsden's chronology and analysis. The details of the doctrinal factionalism among the major Protestant denominations in the 19th century left me bewildered for a while but eventually I got the hang of it - and I was glad I did.For a semi-secular urban type like me, fundamentalism has always been associated with the south and epitomized (for better or worse) by William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes monkey trial. So I was surprised to learn that its roots lie in learned theological disputes among Presbyterians and Baptists in the north after the Civil War. And unlike the fundamentalism of today, the fundamentalism of 100 years ago largely avoided engagement with the political process.Documenting and explaining this century-long transformation is Marsden's task and he does a terrific job. The writing is clear, the approach is fair, and the occasional flashes of dry wit are welcome.The original book was published in 1980 but the new 2006 edition has an additional chapter that ties the recent rise of the Moral Majority and its companions to the larger history. If you would like shed some preconceptions and understand more about the culture, theology, and politics of fundamentalism, I can't imagine there is a better place to start."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"I have been surprised at how good a historical survey this book is. It covers the terrain with citations from many personalities and sources. I regret that while it is a theological book, it is largely historical and not technically theological."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"Some years ago, I learned in college about the Scopes Monkey Trial. That incident, more than any before (or possibly since), tarred the reputation of conservative Christianity in America. George Marsden helps readers to understand \\"the rest of the story\\".As the author makes clear, American fundamentalism was not originally a southern phenomenon. Nor is evangelical fundamentalism closely related to the \\"fundamentalism\\" found in the Middle East and various parts of Asia. There was nothing mean-spirited or even anti-intellectual about its earliest leaders, who held to a logical, Newtonian approach to science and were frequently well-educated. However, outside events gradually caused many of them to feel under siege and to overreact against cultural changes they couldn't control.I found this work invaluable in understanding the present state of American Christianity. Some of the excesses of 1920s fundamentalism subsided in time. Due to that, a much more respectable evangelicalism is predominant today (though even it is frequently misconstrued as a political movement). In the meantime, denominations which rejected historical, biblical theology have continued to decrease in influence and overall vitality. Given that fact, it's little wonder that Christians who hold to the exclusivity of Christ and other traditional beliefs tend to send the most missionaries abroad.One additional insight I gleaned from reading this concerns why a great cultural divide exists between rural and urban America today. News coverage for the Scopes Trail spurred stereotypes of rural dwellers (especially southerners) as uneducated hillibillies who reject all modern innovations. In turn, it caused those from rural areas to be distrustful of the people and ideas of the big cities (particularly in the Northeast). One hopes this division will lessen in the future, though there are indications that this will not be the case."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"This book is one of those classics that becomes the norm for referencing and interpreting American religious history. It has no equal. Now on to the specifics. Per Marsden, American fundamentalism began as a conservative, yet intellectually rigorous force in 19th century America. It employed the fashionable Scottish Common Sense Realism epistemology and used this to respond both to scientific attacks and to build a biblical hermeneutics (the latter leading necessarily to premillenniarism). Far from being a cultural backwater, Fundamentalism held the upper-hand.The term began to shift at the turn of the century. While giants at Princeton were able to contribute to \\"The Fundamentals,\\" secularism was preparing for a counter-attack on American religion. It came in form of the Scopes Monkey Trial. While today's evolutionists have blown this trial way out of proportion, it did signal the beginning of the end of intellectual fundamentalism. As Marden notes, Fundamentalists saw American culture as hopelessly doomed and thus, \\"retreated to the hills.\\" They would then spend more of their time circling the wagons and conducting prophecy conferences.Today's Evangelicalism arose as a response to both Fundamentalist retreatism and secular dominance. Contra the Fundamentalists, Christ called us to regain culture, so argued the Evangelical. Contra the secularist, we can think better than you. This explains the rationale behind Christianity Today and the New Evangelical movement that Carl Henry started.The importance of the above illustrates several things, so Marsden argues: it explains how much of American religious culture went \\"into the backwoods.\\" It explains many evangelical attempts to be \\"relevant to the unbeliever,\\" and it explains why securalism appears to have the most authority today (in terms of money and tenured professors, not in terms of cogent arguments).In conclusion Marsden argues that Fundamentalism both shaped and was shaped by its surrounding culture."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"In his work, Fundamentalism and American Culture, Marsden described fundamentalism (coined in 1920) as a large American Protestant movement \\"shaped by the longstanding . . . urgent need for positive evangelism, missions, and spirituality.\\" (Marsden, 2006, 119, 252) Marsden pointed out that during the 1800s, Thomas Reid's \\"Common Sense philosophy,\\" with its \\"confidence in rational judgments of ordinary people, shaped the Puritan view of Biblical interpretation, later merging with the American evangelical heritage.\\" During the early twentieth century, higher criticism of Scripture and Darwinism led to theological changes in the churches. For fundamentalists, \\"inerrancy\\" of Scripture implied a \\"scientific quality related to the view of truth as directly apprehended facts.\\" Their strong orientation toward the printed word eschewed the mysterious in both exposition and worship. (Marsden, 57, 60-61, 251) Due to \\"Common Sense\\" philosophy, fundamentalists adopted a somewhat rationalist view of Scripture.As an early fundamentalist leader, B.B. Warfield emphasized that faith must be grounded in right reason. True to the demands of Common Sense, Warfield saw the effects of the Fall on human consciousness as pervasive but quite limited. Warfield carefully balanced his appeals to objective evidence with the subjective witness of the Holy Spirit. (Marsden, 115, 121) At Princeton Seminary, J. Gresham Machen struggled to preserve both his inherited Presbyterian faith and his intellectual integrity in a world in which the leading intellectuals, and even many theologians, ridiculed traditionalist Christianity. \\"The Church,\\" he said, \\"is perishing today through the lack of thinking, not through an excess of it.\\" For Machen, liberals subordinated Christianity to culture while evangelicals seemed to ignore culture in order to maintain a pure Christianity. He believed that since the cultural crisis was rooted in the intellectual crisis, an attempt to bypass culture and intellect, the arts and sciences, would simply make the situation worse. Machen's solution was the consecration of culture. Machen eventually assumed Warfield's mantle as chief intellectual spokesman for conservative Presbyterians. Francis Schaeffer studied briefly under Machen at Westminster Theological Seminary. Schaeffer was an effective popularizer of the Reformed idea that Christianity had powerful implications as a cultural critique. Yet, conservative Reformed scholars were finding it increasingly difficult to remain Renaissance Christian humanists. (Marsden, 137-8, 245)The Reformed traditions encouraged more positive attitudes toward intellect, the organized church, and the ideal of building a Christian civilization. Fundamentalist ambivalence about these subjects can be better understood if seen as reflecting not only immediate experience, but also the conflict between the pietist and the Calvinistic traditions. Within the Calvinist tradition, politics was a significant means of advancing the kingdom. Between 1865 and 1900, the view of social and political order transitioned from a postmillennial to a premillennial (or Pietistic) view of political action as no more than a means to restrain evil. By the 1920s, political conservatism consisted of pietists who would use government merely to restrain evil, of Calvinists preserving Christian civilization, or of Anabaptists opposing all Christian involvement in politics. (Marsden, 7, 86, 92)During the 1920s, fundamentalists were often regarded as anti-scientific and anti-intellectual.\\" Their anti-intellectualism and paranoid style was \\"shaped by a desire to strike back at everything modern - the higher criticism, evolutionism, the social gospel, rational criticism of any kind.\\" As a result, fundamentalists were losing much of their influence and respectability. Given the various views of eschatology, keeping premillennial teachings in the background became necessary for establishing a respectable and self-consciously conservative coalition against modernism. (Marsden, 7, 119, 199)Traditionally, American evangelicalism viewed God's redemptive work as manifested in the spiritual and moral progress of American society. Within fundamentalism, different beliefs concerning eschatology resulted in two very different worldviews. (Marsden, 38, 47-9, 63) Whereas premillennialists were less hopeful concerning progress, postmillennialists were optimistic about the spiritual progress of the culture.Nevertheless, premillennialists and postmillennialists regarded the state of American civilization with a mixture of hopeful loyalty and increasing alarm. Fundamentalists saw the fundamental issues as theological. In order to unite evangelical America, a new combination of revivalist, conservative, and premillennial traditions emerged. By 1925, the theological aspect of fundamentalism merged with its concern for the social and moral welfare of the nation. The battle for the Bible developed into a battle for civilization. Combined with changing mores in the culture, fundamentalists experienced profound ambivalence toward the surrounding culture. Marsden pointed out that fundamentalism of recent decades differs from that of the 1920s due to its \\"deep involvement in mainstream national politics.\\" (Marsden, 153, 161-4, 231-2) Marsden examined the extraordinary growth in political emphasis and power of the more recent movement.As the era of faith in science and progressive consensus ended, the countercultural upheaval of the 1960s intervened. \\"In the 1970s distress over rapidly changing public standards regarding sexuality and the family combined with longstanding anti-communist patriotism to make fundamentalistic evangelicals ripe for political mobilization.\\" Without much reflection on how practical political campaigns fit in with continuing predictions that the Rapture and end-times would commence in a few years, an ideal of cultural transformation reemerged as one of the most conspicuous traits of the movement. The central cultural paradox of fundamentalism was thus even more dramatically pronounced then ever. . . . America was simultaneously Babylon and God's chosen nation. Premillennial doctrine and postmillennial rhetoric mixed, reflecting a longstanding cultural ambivalence in the American evangelical heritage. As implicitly postmillennial political rhetoric was flourishing; premillennial end-time scenarios became more popular than ever.\\" (Marsden, 241-249, 256)Modern historiography assumes that human and natural forces shape the course of history and its basic model is something like a biological concept of development.Prone to a more literal interpretation of Scripture, premillennialists begin with the assumption that ongoing warfare between God and Satan shapes history. On the other hand, postmillennialists saw human history as reflecting an ongoing struggle between cosmic forces of God and Satan, each well represented by various earthly powers, but with the victory of righteousness ensured. These totally opposed views of history lay at the heart of the conflict and misunderstanding between theological liberals and their fundamentalist opponents. (Marsden, 38, 47-9, 63) Considering context of evidence is one guideline for good historical writing. Marsden met this guideline by pointing out that the dispensationalist view seems less eccentric if placed in the context of the whole development of Western historiography.Marsden concludes, \\"[I]dentification of cultural forces, such as those with which this book is concerned, is essentially a constructive enterprise, with the positive purpose of finding the gold among the dross.\\" Since we are limited by our culturally determined experience, Marsden states that we should ask God for grace to recognize our limitations as we \\"carefully identify the cultural forces which affect the current versions of Christianity.\\" (Marsden, 259-260) In his work, Marsden described numerous events within the context of American culture that provided insight concerning the growth and development of fundamentalism during the last century. Marsden's description of fundamentalists as \\"militant\\" seems to describe the fundamentalism of my childhood. In his description of fundamentalists and their political activism during recent decades, Marsden provided relevant evidence, or immediacy, meeting a second guideline for good historical writing.In his discussion of B.B. Warfield, J. Gresham Machen, and Francis Schaeffer, Marsden identified causal connections. As a cognitive historian, Marsden met a third guideline for good historical writing by considering intellectual influence, wrestling with questions in history of ideas.Avoiding assumptions, Marsden met a fourth guideline by providing positive, specific evidence concerning events during the last century. Marsden addressed numerous issues within American culture, including the fundamentalist view of Scripture, the Reformed view of culture, as well as the role of differing eschatologies in political activism.In his work, Fundamentalism and American Culture, Marsden demonstrated a thorough, objective understanding of fundamentalism as a cultural phenomenon. Marsden's work would be a valuable addition to the personal library of anyone who seeks a deeper understanding of fundamentalism."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"As a person that devours academic studies on American Religious history, I have to say that Marsden is an author I have a hard time engaging. This book is thorough and loaded with insight, nothing I would not expect from a scholar like Marsden. My biggest issue was that the reading felt very heavy. The beginning part was very easy to jump into but by the middle I found myself slowing down tremendously. Marsden's style doesn't seem to flow likeFrom Bible Belt to Sunbelt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical ConservatismorJesus and Gin: Evangelicalism, the Roaring Twenties and Today's Culture Wars.Aside from the writing style, the book is very informative on the Fundamentalist movement: how it began and what made it tick. There are cartoons from Fundamentalist tracts all throughout the book, which help bring a third dimension the information you are reading about. Marsden looks at men like Machen and Jennings Bryan as well as Fosdick, just to name a few bigger names. He explores the denominational Fundamentalist angle as well as the independent separatists that left their denominations.All in all, if you want to under American Fundamentalism and the Fundamentalist/Liberal battles of the early 20s-60s you need to start here with this book,"},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"In Fundamentalism and American Culture, George Marsden looks at different situations in America's twentieth-century which helped form the fundamentalist movement. Two definitions of fundamentalism have preceded Marsden's work. One view prominent during the 1920s proposed that fundamentalism represented a \\"dying way of life\\" (4). Another interpretation, developed in the 70s from Ernest Sandeen, presented fundamentalism as a descendant of the nineteenth-century millenarian movement, which took from Princeton theology the concept of biblical inerrancy. Marsden believes Sandeen's thesis is the most tenable, but Marsden seeks to expand upon his work by looking at the broader national movement of fundamentalism (5).Marsden defines fundamentalism as \\"a genuine religious movement or tendency with deep roots and intelligible beliefs\\" (6). He is also quick to note fundamentalism's anti-modernist attitude, with evolution and modernism being the movement's two main foes (3-4). His book consists of three different themes. One, the tendency within fundamentalism to sometimes side with the \\"establishment\\" and at other times with the \\"outsiders.\\" Two, the relation of fundamentalism to the earlier American heritage. Three, the problem between the trust and distrust of the mind.One major strength of the book is that Marsden is so objective that one can hardly tell what he believes. Fundamentalism and American Culture is well-researched and filled with facts, rather than a lot of opinions. It is hard to find any weakness in a book which is so tolerant and respectable in its portrayal of important historical figures. One thing that can perhaps be attributed as a weakness is the book's font and layout. The small print, and the division of the sections may have taken away from the beauty of the book's presentation.In conclusion, Fundamentalism and American Culture posits fundamentalism as being formed by specific cultural experiences. Marsden has presented a strong case for his viewpoint, and has effectively treated the history of fundamentalism with respect and dignity. In the afterword of the book, Marsden describes the task of the Christian historian as follows: \\"While he must keep in mind certain theological criteria, he may refrain from explicit judgments on what is properly Christian while he concentrates on observable forces\\" (260). Marsden has done just that in this marvelous exposition of the history of fundamentalism in twentieth-century America."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"I have probably read at least a hundred books about fundamentalists wanting to understand how they think and why they do what they do, but then one day it occurred to me that I had never studied the history of fundamentalism so I bought the book Fundamentalism and American Culture: The Shaping of Twentieth-Century Evangelicalism 1870-1925 and was thoroughly satisfied. As a result of having read the book in question I now feel that I have a reasonably good grasp of where the fundamentalists have come from, and why they believe the way they do. All of such is especially interesting to me since I was brought up attending services in a fundamentalist Baptist Church for the first seventeen years of my life. And now having read the book I have a much better idea what the minister who \\"preached\\" all those horrific \\"hellfire and brimstone\\" and \\"last day/tribulation\\" sermons must have been taught as he went to Bible School or whatever back in the 1920's. It is no wonder that I had to spend so many years dealing with what appears to have been psychological damage done to \\"a child\\" sitting in the third from the front row pew, the right hand side of the church having to hear about the \\"Flames of Hell\\" nearly every Sunday morning! Paradoxically (or perhaps to offset the damage done?), I went on to get a Ph.D degree in Psychology (much of it humanistic psychology) which is the exact (ideological) opposite of fundamentalist theology! My master's degree thesis (Religiosity and the Fear of Death) and my Ph.D. degree dissertation (Religious Orientation and Meaning in Life) both dealt with religion. I have, of course, spent the balance of my last years all the way into retirement integrating the study of religion with that of psycholgy attempting to figure out who God is and how it is that we should relate to Her. In closing, I will have to say that my life has been extremely exciting, filled with great and wonderful questions, although certainly no answers whatsoever, but with much to look forward to."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism and American Culture","review":"Good reading.

Marsden had it right when he said that the fundamental movement was a movement to defend &quot;doctrine&quot; not Christianity. The fundamental movement began because liberal theologians thought they had to defend Christianity from new advances in science (evolution). Men such as J. Gresham Machen and others knew that the Bible and its teaching (doctrine) has the answers to all of science questions. Because of the &quot;defense&quot; of Christianity against science, theologians began to regect Bible doctrine such as: Deity of Christ; Literal 6 day creation; Inspiration of Scripture; Christ's blood atonement for sinners; and Christ's ressurection.

These scholars do not accept the Lord God as described in the Bible. This type of Theologian albeit University instructor or Pastor of a church was quite prominant in Europe before 1870, but not in the United States until later. This book is a debate among those who accept the bible as true as it is and those who deny the word of God as valid.The date of the book is not arbitrary. Since the author cites the end of the Civil war and Darwins theory of evolution as major cataylist to bringing the debate to the forefront in the United States.

A Champion's Tips on How to Lead and Succeed at Work and in Life","review":"As a Patriots fan, I was depressed when Nick Saban became the Dolphins' new head coach because Saban is as similar a football coach to Bill Belichick as you will ever find until scientists perfect cloning. In his new book, Saban lays out his philosophy very clearly. His philosophy helps individuals take control of their lives, work well with others, etc. It also helps leaders build more team-oriented organizations. Everyone can benefit from this book, not just football fans:\\"focus... on what it takes to get to [become a champion], and not on getting there,\\" \\"[Players] encouraged one another and kept each other in line,\\" \\"no selfishness,\\" \\"we shared a purpose,\\" \\"the opponent should never determine your level of competitive spirit,\\" \\"anyone can be successful with the right attitude,\\" \\"a road map... allows everyone... to know where you are headed,\\" \\"what you need are players who have good ability, but who can reach their potential consistently... every time out,\\" \\"be honest and candid and let the players know their prospects,\\" \\"we have a vision for the organization and, more importantly, for the people,\\" \\"create... a culture of expectations [so] everyone knows what to expect,\\" etc. I could go on for many pages.I know Saban's philosophy works because it helped Saban's LSU Tigers (consistent losers before Saban took over) win a share of the 2003 NCAA championship and also helped Belichick's Patriots win two of the past three Super Bowls. It's the same philosophy. I expected great similarities because Saban coordinated the defense of Belichick's Cleveland Browns in the early '90s when the two became closest of friends. But I was shocked reading Saban's book because almost every principle Saban advocates is presented in my book (\\"Management Secrets of the New England Patriots\\") as what I term a \\"success factor\\" underlying the success of Belichick's Patriots.One of the few things in Saban's book that Belichick might disagree with is Saban's argument that \\"Not only should you not concern yourself with the score, you should also avoid setting the bar or establishing the benchmarks for success\\" (p. 58) because, he claims, it's more productive to \\"Stay focused on the next play to dominate [your opponent]\\" (p. 59). Belichick believes strongly in benchmarks: personal and team, short-term, medium-term, and long-term. And Belichick also wants his players to play to the score. If they have a lead late in the game, he wants them to stay in-bounds to run down the clock, for example. I'm not sure Belichick and Saban disagree as much on this as Saban's book suggests. One of Saban's running themes is the importance of focusing on the minute-by-minute process rather than the long-term goal (national championship, winning the game, etc.). Belichick certainly preaches this too.The principles in this book are valuable and clearly explained. My only disappointment is that the book lacks drama. The opening chapter (\\"Part 1\\") is a tedious list of plays from LSU's championship season. I didn't know the players or care about them, so I nearly fell asleep. This material could have been fun had it been integrated into the rest of the book to illustrate particular principles.Aside from Saban's stellar ideas, the book's highlights are occasional colorful examples, many involving his dad. To illustrate \\"Disappointment is a part of life,\\" he cites his dad saying, \\"Be like the grass--the more manure they throw on you, the stronger you get.\\" My favorite part is actually his father's story (36-39). Like Belichick, Saban received a brilliant education from his father, in both football and life: \\"Invest your time, don't spend it.\\" \\"It's not just about the results. It's about perfect execution.\\" \\"You reap what you sow.\\" Someone could write a great book about the fathers of great football coaches.Three stars for writing. Seven stars for content. Averages to 5 stars!"},{"Title":"How Good Do You Want to Be? A Champion's Tips on How to Lead and Succeed at Work and in Life","review":"Nick Saban's method for success is broken down into three main points in his book, How Good Do You Want to Be?; these are the development of the product, having the competitive spirit, and the importance of leadership. This guide to success was published by Random House, Inc. in New York in 2005.In Saban's first point he emphasizes the development of the \\"product.\\" In most cases the product is the person who wants to be successful, but it also includes sports teams, companies, or projects. To develop the product, a \\"road map\\" is needed. A road map is a guide to life. It should define one's goals and guidelines. This is to make sure that one knows his values. The five key values are discipline, commitment, toughness, effort, and pride. The map should also take into account the \\"three C's.\\" These will foster one's success. The \\"three C's\\" are commitment, conviction, and character. Commitment is defined as unwavering loyalty and dedication. If one is dedicated enough, then he will eventually succeed. Conviction is when one really believes in what he is doing. Conviction is the reason for being committed. The third \\"C,\\" character, is \\"that crucial blend of personality and values\\" (Saban 35). Character is who a person really is. A positive attitude is crucial to how one responds to challenges, success, and failure. To be successful, one has to really \\"develop the product.\\"Saban's second point is the necessity of the competitive spirit. Saban states the importance of not thinking about the score, saying, \\"looking at the score and results can only take away from your competitive spirit\\" (Saban 58). A person only needs to be concerned with what he or she can control. He also highlights the significance of focus. He knows that everyone needs to \\"separate the important stuff, to minimize the distractions to maximize focus\\" (Saban 61). To be good, one must focus on the goal and ignore everything else. Saban stresses how bad complacency is, stating, \\"successes will continue only as long as the commitment to the process of being successful remains in place\\" (Saban 72). In other words, never accept the current position no matter how good it is. Saban also knows that everyone has self-imposed limitations, but he knows that \\"we cannot become victims of ourselves\\" (Saban 73). One cannot let insecurity hold him back. The competitive spirit is necessary for success.Saban's third point is the importance of leadership. To be a good leader, one must do several things daily. One must stand up to adversity. He must lead, but not force, pick his battles, and accept responsibility when something goes wrong. Most importantly a good leader must always insist on excellence. This goes back to complacency. One must never settle on the current condition. Saban also knows that \\"great leaders don't have all the answers, but they find them\\" (Saban 142). Saban recognizes the magnitude of leadership and defines what being a good leader means.In How Good Do You Want to Be? Saban completely achieves his original goal of motivating success and providing a path for it. Saban's book is like a bridge over the troubled waters that are today's problems. It provides a way to success. How Good Do You Want to Be? is the best guide to success I have ever read. This book is really changing the way I am living.In How Good Do You Want to Be? Nick Saban outlines his system for success. He breaks down his method with the three points of developing the product, competitiveness, and leadership. This book is extremely motivational and everyone who wants to be good should read it."},{"Title":"How Good Do You Want to Be?

While most of the components of his philosophy are fundamental (hard work, integrity, communication skills, balance, etc.), there are actually some original ideas that run counter to those pitched in typical success/leadership books. This is where I believe the value lies. Examples include focusing on the process - not the goals, setting a start time but not an end time, and playing to dominate (no matter what the score).Like him or not, Saban has a unique system that works (assuming he stays around long enough to implement it).

But this new collection is far and away the best of the lot. I believe there are two reasons for this. First, the writers of the essays in this volume have the tremendous advantage of being able to look back on all seven seasons of Buffy and speak with some authority on what actually happened. If you read the other collections, there was always constant speculation about what might happen in the future. Now we know what happened. But the second and more important reason this collection is so superb is the fact that it was written almost exclusively by creative writers rather than academics. Although I am an academic myself, too many of the academic essays written on Buffy seem to me transparent attempts to graft unconnected academic interests onto the writers' favorite TV show. The writers here, however, are truly trying to tease out the meaning of the show on its own terms, and not trying to force the themes of the show fit the needs of philosophical, cultural, or feminist theory.Another advantage of this collection is that just about every selection in the volume is excellent. I might want to differ with a couple, like the one that defends Riley as the best boyfriend for Buffy or the one that lavishes extensive praise on Tara (I don't dislike Tara, and loved her singing in &quot;Once More, With Feeling,&quot; but I can't really get excited about her, either; I do, however, really dislike Riley, like a majority of Buffy fans), but even those take up positions that are fun to argue with. Some of the pieces are flat out outstanding, such as an early one that is cast as a essay question on a test in which a demon is asked to explain which is the most powerful force for good in Sunnydale and why (answer: Xander, with an interesting defense). In the other anthologies, there were essays I had to suffer through in order to get to others more to my liking. There isn't a clunker in the bunch here.If I had a complaint--though I really don't--it would be that too many of the essays are fixated on the romance aspects of Buffy. I would estimate that well over half of the essays primarily are focused on one or more of the romances in the series. My own interests have always focused on the ethical aspects (e.g., did Spike's actions in Seasons 5 and 6 give him something like a soul before the shaman gave him one at the end of Season 6?, or on the extraordinary optimism that pervades the series that people can grow and become more than they are, that leopards can indeed change their spots), but clearly anyone who hates romance is not going to enjoy Buffy for very long. My lone complaint is that there isn't a bit more diversity of subject matter. There are just a few too many articles focusing on romance than I would have liked.Still and all, this is a great, great book, and although I have frequently noted in other reviews that anthologies by their very nature are inconsistent and uneven, this one breaks that rule. It starts off great and stays that way all the way through. I can't imagine anyone with any interest in Buffy at all, not loving this collection."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"I really wanted to give this book like 3.5 stars, but I figured I'd round down instead of up since everyone else is praising it. First off, I did find many of the articles interesting, particularly the article about \\"Insiders vs. Outsiders.\\" And the comical, albeit cheesy, faux-college-essay describing why Xander is the M.P.I.F.F.G. (Most Powerful Individual Force for Good) was also enjoyable and thought-provoking.Those points aside, this book seemed to endlessly repeat itself. The first time someone explained why Angel, Riley, and Spike were bad partners for Buffy, it was quasi-interesting. By the third or fourth times, it was a broken record. Each author might add a slightly different take, but it was all basically the same. The book is littered with many other repeated themes that make the book not as fun to read as it could have been. Also, with the exception of the introduction and the Xander Essay, this book can be very dry at times. This is a shame, because the humorous intro and Essay are over within the first 20 pages, and the rest can be dense at times.The thing that really surprised me was how many small errors there were in this book. It really seemed like no one ever proof-read this book before sending it to the printers. One of my major beefs is an author who claimed to be a huge fan referring to Machida (the snake demon from Season 2's \\"Reptile Boy\\") as \\"Mikusa.\\" This is just sloppy work, and a real fan would have taken the two seconds to look up the demon's name online if they weren't sure about it.The bulk of the errors are in the numbering of the episodes, and the fact that episodes may be credited as happening at multiple times. Depending on what you read in the book, the episode \\"School Hard\\" was either episode 2-3(which it was), 2-5, or 2-15. And the \\"Becoming\\" episodes, which were episodes 2-21 and 2-22, happened either in the second season, the third season, or the sixth season. And one of the times \\"Becoming, Part One\\" was in the third season (3-21, it was called), Jenny Calendar was still alive (even though she died in 2-17...or as that author would have said, 3-17). And occasionally, it just seems that the author of a particular piece, and the (possibly invisible) proofreader were just lazy:\\"The second-season finale is titled 'Becoming' (3-21, 3-22)...\\"If you can get this book at a library, I won't try and dissuade you from checking it out, because it does have some interesting ideas and doesn't talk down to you. However, its redundancy and errors keep this from being a book I would even give 4 stars to."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"When it comes to buying books about tv shows I think a lot before I buy. Not many titles get my trust.I took a chance with this book but in the end it was all worth it.Not only do you get many interesting views in and around the show in question but also some rather insightful thoughts on the subject. All from clever writers and the rest is up to the reader to agree or not agree with. But I found it good reading. I actually was served a few views I had not thought of my self. So all in all it was good money spent."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"This collection of 23 essays about BtVS has the advantage of being written after the series finale, allowing a wider scope than similar, earlier books. Although these are (mostly) serious, thoughtful essays, they are written in a more readable, accessible style than &quot;BtVS and Philosphy&quot; by James South, which required a PhD in philosophy to understand.In a book like &quot;Seven Seasons of Buffy,&quot; everyone will have their favorites. One of the best was Zettel's piece, where she argues that the real reason the series went downhill after Season Three was - not because the characters were no longer in high school - but because their role had changed from &quot;outsiders&quot; to &quot;insiders.&quot; In high school part of the appeal was that they had only a hazy notion of the forces against them (e.g., the mayor's plot); it was more difficult to empathize with the characters when they lost that &quot;outsider&quot; role. I also loved Larbalestier's article because, although not cohesive as an essay, she articulates what an utter disaster Season Seven was. This series went downhill fast. (The episode &quot;Empty Places&quot; gets my personal vote for ultimate low point of the series.)Another great essay was Carter's article about alternate realities in BtVS. Ever notice that &quot;The Wish&quot; (in which we are led to believe that the alternate reality was extinguished when Anyanka lost her powers) is inconsistent with &quot;Doppelgangland&quot; (the alternate reality continues to exist parallel to the &quot;real&quot; reality)?One of the weaker essays was Golden's, in which she complains that the presentation of wicca was unauthentic on BtVS. (Hey, anyone want to write an article about how badly Christianity is portrayed on this series?) I was also unimpressed with Harris's complaint about the good-looks bias in casting, and by Watt-Evans' speculation that Buffy and Wesley would be the ideal couple, and by Aloi's over-the-top rhapsodizing about how beautiful Tara was."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"While, in my opinion, this book wasn't as good as it's sister collection, Five Seasons of Angel, it was still very entertaining, insightful, and often humorous. Essays were very well done and most of them had very good points to make. Essay subjects ranged from the censorship of the show to individual character studies, to thinking about elements of Joss Whedon's complex universe. The thing that surprised me the most, though, was that some of my favorite essays had to do with characters who weren't part of the core four (Buffy, Xander, Willow, and Giles). Two of my favorite essays were the ones about Tara and Riley, and they really got me thinking of how good each of those characters are (although not many people will agree with me about Riley). Although I also enjoyed the essay about Xander, one reason being the creative format of the essay, and I think that my favorite overall was the final one, dealing with how season seven and the series finale not only tied up the last year the way it should have ended, but also ended the series the way it should have. With a few exceptions, this was a great read, and any Buffy fan should consider at least borrowing this book."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Discuss Their Favorite Television Show is very nearly a text I could have recommended to anyone; those who think Buffy was Shakespeare, those who think it was, or turned into, crap, and even those who think it was -- gasp -- &quot;just&quot; a television show. But unfortunately, like Buffy itself, this book loses its way and runs out of good ideas by the end. Let's start with the good stuff; the essays that had me thinking I could finally start a Buffy-related book review with words to the effect of &quot;Now that's what I'm talking about!&quot;Sarah Zettel adds brilliant depth and a convincing thesis to a not uncommon criticism of the series: That Buffy lost, at the very least, certain cohesion when the characters graduated from high school. And in what I think is the heart of this collection, Justine Larbalestier charts her evolution over the course of Buffy's seven seasons from Champion of All Things Buffy to Horrified ex-true believer. In so doing, Larbalestier reflects the experiences of millions of Buffy watchers who found themselves seduced by a dramatic series for television, convinced themselves it was something more than it could ever be, and eventually hit the wall.Jacqueline Lichtenberg's essay is devoted to the idea that &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not 'just' a TV show.&quot; but a watershed event for television as literature. I dunno, I think she needs to look at her watch once in a while. In his nearly-brilliant 1992 book Teleliteracy, TV reviewer (and future Buffy fan) David Bianculli devoted an entire chapter to the idea that &quot;Some Television Is Literature -- And Vice Versa,&quot; using as examples series (Taxi, St. Elsewhere, others) that pre-date Buffy by at least 15 years.I am not saying that Buffy, at its best, was not the equal of the shows I've mentioned above at theirs. It was a really good show, when it was a really good show, like a lot of really good shows. It's just not inherently superior to all other shows, as some writers here want us to believe.Still, as a whole, this book is better written than earlier Buffy-related volumes I've reviewed here on Amazon. It is badly marred, however, by the inclusion of a piece by Kevin Andrew Murphy. His essay digresses into vile, dubious and non-representative portraits of fans of actress Amber Benson, who played Tara on Buffy, as stalkers. It's based on wild speculation and deserves contempt for its intent to smear these fans.I myself am a fan of the character Tara, and the group Mr. Murphy attacks in this book is one with which I am well acquainted. So let me make something clear: I am not saying that any fan group, much less one with which I have been associated, is above thoughtful criticism, any more than I believe Buffy is. Unfortunately, thoughtful criticism is not what Murphy does here."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"As the title of the book indicates, this book deals with the show as a whole--the whole seven seasons. So if you haven't seen all seven seasons yet (particularly the seventh season), you may get a little lost because the writers like to reference everything from season 1 to season 7. And yes, I did say writers. 22 different essays for the Buffster and her loyal Scoobies. Some are academic analyses, others fun creative writing such as direct girl advice to Buffy or the best force of good written from a demon's point of view. This latter one was my favorite, titled \\"Is that Your Final Answer...?\\" Quite entertaining.Overall there are some really good essays, a few not great essays, and even a few essays that are outstanding until some point that just doesn't make sense. Yet the overall product is likeable with a large variety of topics. \\"The Meaning of Buffy\\", \\"Matchmaking on the Hellmouth\\" and \\"Slayers of the Last Arc\\" are probably my second favorites after the demon written essay.I recommend this book to any Buffy fan with an understanding that they will enjoy most of the essays and probably dislike a couple as well. The style of each essay is quite different due to the different authors but they compliment each other well.As for the format, the book begins with a foreward from Drew Goddard, one of the co-authors for the show. Then each essay starts with a blurb from Glenn Yeffeth, the editor, to give you an idea what the essay is about if the title confuses you or is too ambiguous. Then the essay presents itself and is followed by a small paragraph about that particular writer.

If you've been to a Buffy posting board or a lj fan community, you've already seen all these arguments hashed and re-hashed to death. No new insights are found in this book. In fact, many essays spend so much time re-telling plot points that arguments of any kind are barely made. There are a couple of interesting essays, but that's not enough to warrant paying full price.

I also expected to read some great trivia and insider information that I hadn't heard, but no such luck. I enjoyed the essays by most of the authors, but many essays were just synopsis of the seven seasons, and I was there watching too, so the over explanations of some scenes was a bit boring. However there were some bright points, for example, Roxanne L. Conrad's Final Exam for Spatial Interdimensional Metaphysics was a great read, Sherrilyn Kenyon's Search for Spike's Balls was thought provoking, and although Scott Westerfield is a bit wordy, he makes some interesting observations. My main regret is that I didn't buy it used and save some of the money I spent."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. There were no great insights into the show or the characters. In some places it was a scene by scene narrative of almost entire episodes. I much prefered the philisophical musings in \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosphy\\" edited by James B. South. At least it got me thinking. I was hoping this book (Seven Seasons) would show me aspects of the characters or plots that I hadn't seen - instead I got to read the very superficial musings of people with very little to share.I actually found the final essay in the book, \\"Slayers of the Last Arc\\" to be the most enjoyable and not just because of it's insight into the show but also as a great \\"how to\\" guide for writers. I also really enjoyed Sarah Zettel's \\"When did the Scoobies become Insiders?\\" and Jennifer Crusie's \\"Dating Death\\".This book is not a total write-off and I did finish it but I would look elsewhere if you're looking for something other than a basic episode guide."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"Jennifer Crusie's article I'd say was the best, Sherrilyn Kenyon's the worst. Crusie's article had depth, humor and really gave you a sense of the show. Sherrilyn Kenyon's was a repulsive misogynistic rant of the like of Phyllis Shafley. The hatred Kenyon has for women that aren't airheaded doormats to men was freakish. Now I know why her books are filled with abusive posturing men and vapid wimpy females, aparently that is the only acceptable type of realtionship to her. Ugh, why the heck did the woman even watch Buffy? Buffy was created to counteract repulsive attitudes like hers. Whedon's idea of \\"girlpower\\" wasn't always on key- frankly, in seasons 1-4 I found Buffy acting too much a doormat to Angel and Riley for my tastes, while other than the darkest point of season 6 when we got \\"psycho\\" Buffy, the Buffy and Spike relationship was a passionate, equalitive, sexy, and in season 7 (my favorite season, particularly the second half) deeply romantic and almost spiritual. A modern Jungian psychologist might even say they were a near perfect Anima/Animus pairing in season 7."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"This series of essays may be of interest to the most serious and cerebral Buffy fans. But Buffy was not a serious and cerebral exercise. It was the best of campy cheeky fun. The writers of these essays did not seem to get it.Granted there were life lessons and moral issues. Indeed, \\"The Body\\" may be argueably the finest 60-minutes ever broadcast on American TV. However the \\"musical\\", \\"Thanksgiving\\", and \\"Xander's wedding\\" were meant to be a hoot.Obviously, I was dissappointed by this book.

This book, however,takes the cake. It is, of coarse, at an adavantage due to the fact that this is the only of the three which was relesed AFTER the series finalie. The two other books constantly speculate what MAY happen in the series' close, this however is able to consider all aspects of the series.This book is also and easy read. . .or well at least easy-ER then the previous two. The intorduction by Buffy writer Drew Goddard is rather interesting. Especialy is ur as big a fan as i am. Goddard wrote an amazing 5 episodes in the shows final season, more even then series creater joss whedon.His episodes included some of the seasons best:\\"selfless\\", \\"conversations with dead people\\" and \\"dirty girls\\".His knowledge of the show is really a plus due to his insite into the series.

Buffy's romances and the significance of various supporting characters are explored. Why Buffy is actually high epic literature is revealed.

I didn't agree with everything the essayists put forth, but appreciated the contrasting opinions that made me consider other outlooks. This book is a celebration of everything that Buffy was, but doesn't hold back when presenting theories and ideas that show fans may rabidly disagree with.What disappointed me: With any anthology of this nature, some essays were drier than other and some essayists seemed less familiar with the subject that they should have been. It wasn't perfect, but it was one of the better books that look deeper into Buffy.Recommended: Buffy fans, obviously, but the more fanatical the better."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"Just goes to show, fantasy & sci-fi writers are human, too, and they fall prey to frenzied fandom as much as you and I. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER has been gone for a few years now, and I still miss it, and I still look around for some sort of substitute to satisfy Buffy withdrawal. There's Joss Whedon's Season Eight as chronicled in comic book form, so that's cool. But SEVEN SEASONS OF BUFFY is another alternative that might tide you over. It's a book anthology of Buffy-centric essays as written by some fairly big names in the sci-fi & fantasy genre. These articles - twenty-two of them, as well as the foreword from Drew Goddard (he co-wrote \\"Conversations With Dead People\\") - vary from insightful to droll to tongue-in-cheek, to sometimes all three. Topics span a wide range but all related to the Slayer's universe. For fans who just enjoy reading articles about the Slayer and her world or for fans who struggle to articulate just what Buffy means to them or why exactly is it that Buffy matters on a pop culture level or on a public consciousness level, well, this book might help.The beauty of this anthology is that differing viewpoints are offered, and it's up to you to agree or disagree. For example, I really liked Seasons 6 & 7 so I wasn't down with how Justine Larbalestier closes her very passionate essay. I'm not a fan of Riley, so while I concede certain points to Michelle Sagara West's piece, it still left me feeling kind of meh. On the other hand, as a proponent of the last two seasons, I totally dig Nancy Holder's \\"Slayers of the Last Arc.\\" So, I'm saying, this book should have something for everyone, but it'll also possibly have stuff that'll cheese you off.A few of the essays are framed creatively, but not as creatively as Roxanne Longstreet Conrad's \\"Is That Your Final Answer ...?\\" which purports to be a lowly hellion's demonic term paper which presents Xander Harris as the Greatest Force for Good in Sunnydale. David Brin's \\"Buffy vs. the Old-Fashioned 'Hero'\\" asserts that the Slayer celebrates the inclusion of the common folk while other popular epics such as LORD OF THE RINGS and STAR WARS tend to cling to elitist ways.There's an inescapable theme of sensuality and sexuality in the show, and so we get Nancy Kilpatrick's saucy delving into Buffy's love life in \\"Sex and the Single Slayer,\\" with Jennifer Crusie's \\"Dating Death\\" covering similar ground. Carla Montgomery's \\"Innocence\\" explores the relationship entanglements Buffy and her friends get into, and the growth and loss of innocence that come with the package of falling in love. Michelle Sagara West's \\"For the Love of Riley\\" makes a case for Riley Finn's being THE ONE for Buffy. Elsewhere, Lawrence Watt-Evans' fun \\"Matchmaking on the Hellmouth\\" arrives at a startling \\"ideal romantic interest\\" for Buffy (which, okay, you do see coming mainly because the writer eliminates every other suspect from the list). Meanwhile, Jean Lorrah's \\"Love Saves the World\\" suggests that Buffy's makeshift \\"family\\" of friends, however dysfunctional, is actually the Slayer's biggest asset in fighting the forces of evil, best evidenced in Xander's saving the world at the end of Season 6 by getting thru to Dark Willow.Sherrilyn Kenyon's \\"The Search for Spike's Balls\\" suggests that Buffy herself is a sort of vampire in that she sucks virility and masculinity from the menfolk in her life. In \\"Lions, Gazelles and Buffy,\\" Chelsea Yarbro discusses her \\"Prey & Predator\\" theory with Buffy, naturally, cast in the role of the predator.Scott Westerfeld pushes his theory of two recurring plot devices - the \\"Alternate World\\" and the \\"Trespass\\" story (basically, the Trespass theme is \\"A stranger comes to town...\\"). Westerfeld labels BUFFY as inherently a \\"Trespass\\" story, except the few instances when the show becomes an \\"Alternate World\\" show. And then there's Scott's sub-theme of the \\"Elasticity of Trespass\\" in which everything reverts to status quo by episode's end (more prevalent in the monster-of-the-week episodes). Scott goes into BUFFY's occasional stabs at subverting the \\"Elasticity of Trespass.\\" I'm describing this really clunkily but it doesn't change the fact that Scott Westerfeld writes an entertaining piece here. Conversely, Margaret L. Carter's \\"A World Without Shrimp\\" breaks down the \\"alternate reality\\" episodes (\\"Superstar,\\" \\"Normal Again,\\" and \\"The Wish\\").Laura Resnick's \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ambivalent\\" explores the show's dark, twisty character arcs - and, honestly, going by sweet, nerdy first season Willow, did anyone guess she'd transform into Dark \\"I just want to end the world\\" Willow? Resnick also asserts that Spike is the show's most ambivalent character. Marguerite Krause's \\"The Meaning of Buffy\\" targets the relationships and connections that the characters form. And then there's Krause's quest for the show's strongest, healthiest relationship (can you guess?).In \\"A Buffy Confession\\" Justine Larbalestier articulates her obsession with BUFFY, her increasing paranoia that upcoming episodes won't live up to standard, and her worst fears being realized with Season 7. Sarah Zettel's \\"When Did the Scoobies Become Insiders?\\" covers the Scoobies' topsy-turvy evolution from misfits to insiders, and how sad that kind of was. She also mentions Jonathan who, more than just about anyone else in the show, typifies the ultimate loser and outsider. It's telling that when Jonathan gets a chance to alter reality to one in which he is the \\"Superstar,\\" he chooses the Scooby gang to validate his inclusion to the in-crowd.Kevin Andrew Murphy's \\"Unseen Horrors & Shadowy Manipulations\\" relates how outside criticism and sponsorship and fan outpouring can sometimes influence the show. Murphy cites the infamous \\"Double Meat Palace\\" fiasco as one example.Peg Aloi's \\"Skin Pale as Apple Blossom\\" is an ode to Amber. Christine Golden's \\"Where's the Religion in Willow's Wicca?\\" first addresses the awesomeness that is Willow Rosenberg and then goes on to debunk her identity as a Wiccan. In \\"A Reflection on Ugliness\\" the sassy Charlene Harris accuses Joss Whedon of bias against ugly people. She expounds.Jacqueline Lichtenberg's \\"Power of Becoming\\" attempts to sell television as an artistic medium that is on its way to becoming Great Literature, and how BtVS figures prominently in this evolution. As a fan of television, who am I to beg to differ? BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was a pretty cool show."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"Seven Seasons of Buffy is a motley collection of essays, written by academics, professional writers and fans alike. This book is definitively not for the casual Buffy viewer. In-depth analysis quotes episode titles by name, and often gives little else for reference. The essays are somewhat choppy in quality. They range from dry scholarly monographs to earnestly geeky sqeefests. As one can easily expect, the smoothest to read and most enjoyable of the lot were written by previously published YA/teen fantasy authors. It's fun to see big names like Charlaine Harris, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Scott Westerfeld, and Justine Larbalestier reveal their nerdy side. Not a lot of new ground is covered... check any Whedon-themed internet message board, and you can find plenty of similar essays online, but this collection seems to pull together a nice selection representative of some of the best Buffy-inspired critical analysis out there.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer, written by, it says, \\"science fiction and fantasy writers.\\" Except that the reason I even knew about this book is that one contributor is Jennifer Crusie, and she's not by any stretch of the imagination a science fiction or fantasy writer. Unless you're one of those terminal cynics who classifies romance as fantasy.The good:The essays that took some aspect of the show and drew conclusions, and made me think, whether I agreed with them or not.Those essays that left the biggest impression were the ones that were well-written, but that I disagreed with. Like the one praising Tara. In principle, I agreed, but in the show, she got on my last nerve--I really dislike sad-sack, pitiful, depressed, martyr characters.The best thing about this anthology is that it provides a lot of food for thought, and springboards for conversation with other Buffy fan(atic)s.The bad:The essays that rambled on, more or less summarizing the series without actually making a point.The essays that made a narrow-minded point or insulted those with opposing viewpoints, like the one praising Riley. I could follow the author's reasoning, but she lost me when she claimed that anyone who didn't agree with her was stuck in high school, and that real, adult, mature love was by definition, dull.The verdict:As in any anthology, there are good essays and bad ones. Fortunately, there were more good ones than bad."},{"Title":"Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors Discuss Their Favorite Television Show (Smart Pop series)","review":"A bunch of other writers talk about the most excellent Buffy.

The travesty is that people always assume there is \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" and \\"they\\" are always the monsters. \\"We can't possibly have it in us to do these horrible things.\\" The sad case is most are accomplices either by their apathy, ambition, or some other mundane aspect.Whether Hohne desired to or not, he hammers this point home. With painstaking detail using first-hand accounts, interviews, diaries, letters and other documentation Hohne crafts an in-depth portrait of Nazi Germany, the SS, and the men involved. Most weren't insane or sadists. To this list I would add even Himmler, Eichmann, Muller, Heydrich and others. Eichmann wasn't even an anti-Semite. Sadly, I don't think he saw anything other than numbers as any efficient bureaucrat would. This book clearly demonstrates how easily normal people were compromised by their own small decisions to become monsters. Action A desensitized them to B and the road to Hell was made in baby steps.Hohne makes his case that Nazi Germany wasn't a monolithic State but a jungle. The illusion of a central authority, even Hitler as such, is a myth. By documenting how various depts. wax and wane along with their respective spheres of influence and maddening overlap of responsibilities, Hohne shatters the monolithic image of the Nazi State. State powers grew unchecked by law, international pressure, or civic duty. Fascist intellectuals had stated that their State was beyond Law. This is what happened when a State had no checks.It was a power grab in a madhouse. Various State organs were run as fiefdoms by ambitious men with Hitler in the center as a lion tamer. At any moment one fo those lions could, and would, have eaten him. All the way down the chain, everyone ran their little empires and sought to increase them. The image of Hitler I have after reading this is from the old Doors song \\"rider on the storm.\\" He played one powerful potentate off against another to maintain his position. Hitler was the penultimate politician.The book reads well, though dry statistics can occasionally bore. The large \\"cast of characters\\" creates difficulty in remembering who did what when esp since individuals frequently wore more than one hat. Trying to remember various shifting State entities is difficult. Hohne does an excellent job of documenting the shifting spheres of influence among the horde of departments in Nazi Germany, but you will often find yourself backtracking. Familiarize yourself with the Appendices to reduce confusion. In the end, the read is exceptional and well worth it.Goriness and sensationalism are kept to a minimum. The real horror is how, step-by-step, normal people were roped into insanity and how absolutely easy it was. There never was (or is) any great evil conspiracy. Nazi-ism's rise is best expressed inadvertently by Carl Sandberg when he wrote \\"the fog comes on little cat feet.\\" Those who treasure human & civil rights, liberty and justice should read this book."},{"Title":"Order of Death's Head","review":"This book was gruesome.

This books get very specific when they tell about how some infants were killed. One would throw the baby in the air, and the other would try to catch it the end of the knife.

For example, Treasure Island and Kidnapped are adventure stories aimed a young male readers longing for travel and excitement. The Master of Ballentrae and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde explore the dark, sinister side of human nature. In none of these famous works does romance play an important part. \\"Prince Otto\\", however, is ultimately a love story, although it may not seem apparent early in the book. The Prince and his wife, Princess Serafina, in their roles as heads of state and royalty, have grown apart from each other. As the story progresses, they undergo momentous transformations as they begin to lose these superficial veneers that mask their humanity. The unlikely catalyst for this transformation is a web of court intrigue that includes power struggles, treachery, and deceit. The story is vividly and beautifully told by the writer, whom I believe is the most readable of 19th century authors."},{"Title":"Prince Otto, ([Royal blue library])","review":"This is a difficult book to classify. It is certainly not an adventure story (like most other RLS novels) or a mystery. While almost humorous, it is not written as a comedy, and it can only be loosely categorized as a romance. Telling a seemingly serious story, of the downfall of a German prince and the rise of democracy, the tone of the story belies that seriousness and lends itself more to a comedy. The primary characters are foppish and overly dramatic, giving this story the aspect of a satire on the courts of old Europe. Nothing too blatant, but you can't help but get the feel of the author's sarcasm as he describes rough country folk, pampered courtiers, and emotional royalty.That being said, this does tell a complete and almost fairy tale-like story. As Otto and Seraphina blunder into loosing everything, they wind up gaining even more. A tale of growth, love, and shedding the petty stuff, PRINCE OTTO has all the makings of a serious story with worthwhile lessons, desperate chances, and a happy ending. Throw in Stevenson's not-quite-satirical prose and the not-quite-respectable characters and you've got a curiously light-hearted read with a dangerously serious plot. Here's respect to Stevenson for pulling off this unexpected and uniquely entertaining novel.Recommended for those that enjoy something different every now and then."},{"Title":"Prince Otto, ([Royal blue library])","review":"What a let down of a novel. Interesting to read a great writer floundering when writing another genre. Characters two dimensional, tale contrived, and Stevenson out of his depth when attempting satire. Basically I reckon his heart wasn,t in it and it shows."},{"Title":"Prince Otto, ([Royal blue library])","review":"I am a great admirer of Robert Louis Stevenson's books, as I find in them some of the greatest adventure stories the human imagination has brought forth. Stevenson's work has a quality that is different from the adventures of most other authors: boyish imagination. When we read something by someone like Alexandre Dumas, the element of adventure is still there, but it is missing something of the \\"boyishness\\" or innocence of Stevenson's adventures. Dumas' work was informed by real life interation with people, while Stevenson's work tended to be more from imagination than from experience. His books are the things he wishes he himself could do, but could not because of his tuberculosis.Now, I came to this book expecting to find the same adventure and imagination that I found in Treasure Island, The Master of Ballantre, Kidnapped, etc., but I was severely dissapointed. Wikipedia said of this book that it was \\"Stevenson's second full-length narrative, an action romance set in the imaginary Germanic state of Gr&uuml;newald.\\" This is simply not true. There is no action or adventure in this book. It is a story about Prince Otto of Grunewald, a middle-aged man with a weak characted who is an admitedly poor ruler whose wife rules behind his back by means of Herr von Gondremark, with whom she is widely held to be having an affair. The whole story is basically about the Prince attempting to be a good prince and husband, but failing, the whole time revealing the flaws in his charatcer. While this sounds like a set up for comedy, Stevenson takes a completely serious approach to it, eliminating even that possability of enjoyment.This book is nothing short of a character study in the manner of Jane Austin. While this is not bad, Stevenson frankly is not nearly so good at it as Austin. This book is not exciting, not funny, and not exceptionally enjoyable. It is missing the most basic element of Stevenson's success: his adventurous imagination. It is very obviously a forced work, and when he tries to give some settings a more \\"poetic\\" feel the descriptions he uses are almost comically forced. I am sorry to say anything bad about one of Stevenson's books, but this is simply not a good book, especially when compared to the rest of Stevenson's accomplishments.Overall Grade: D-"},{"Title":"Roll-Call: The Old Rose Breeder: A Gazetteer of Breeders, Introducers, and Their Roses Through 1920 (Old Rose Researcher)","review":"This is the first-ever complete listing of breeders of old roses with all their introductions, principally covering the era 1790-1920, showing the scope and direction of their efforts, which in many cases continued, developed, and diversified over several decades, in some cases indeed being continued by children or widows.

His Adobe Photoshop knowledge is also very useful when post processing scans of film, slides, or negatives as well as existing digital images.Matt, thanks for your time and energy in writing this book. I will recommend it to both family and friends."},{"Title":"Digital Art Photography For Dummies","review":"Matt Bamberg's book Digital Art Photography for Dummies is an excellent resource for both the beginner and the advanced student of Digital Photography. I have read the book and of especial interest to me were the numerous overt and subtle suggestions about technique and execution. Suggestions which I have used to great effect to dramatically improve my own compositions and to better concentrate and focus my shots.In addition I really benefited from the suggestions regarding how to process and enhance your work, post shooting. One of the more important foci of the book regards how to transform your work from more simple photographic imagery into more complex renditions which can be considered artistic. Matt explains these techniques for image modification easily and logically and it was not difficult with the right equipment and software for me to begin experimenting with altering my works to produce far more spectacular work. Work which others have expressed interest in. I have even become my church photographer and have recently had other people ask me to undertake photographic assignments on their behalf. In addition I have started the process of taking previous shots and altering them for inclusion into my written works, as graphic enhancements to my writings.However the book also contains a myriad of techniques which are useful and helpful for the amateur and for the individual who uses photography as a part of their other work. I am often involved in investigations and through some experimentation and adaptation I have used techniques suggested and explained by Matt in order to clarify, focus, and render my investigative photographs far sharper, clearer, and more relevant for my clients. So the book has indirectly benefited me professionally as well.I have enjoyed Matt's book, have visited his blog and site, and found him to be an accessible and helpful author. Additionally he obviously knows his subject matter and is therefore professionally well-qualified. He seems very experienced and yet eagerly experimental, two traits I like in any individual who is trying to teach me something new.I have Matt's book and consider it a valuable addition to my personal library on the subjects of both art and photography.I recommend the book.Jack."},{"Title":"Digital Art Photography For Dummies","review":"I liked this book because it helped me in my work as a Realtor.

I have been reading so I can report back to you.I am a amaturer photographer who is interested in creating digital art, professional images and learning how to enhance my photos using image technology. I found Matt's, book easy to understand and read plus offering helpful graphics and images to go along with each chapter.I have purchased many self help books, Digital Art Photography for Dummies, written by Matthew Bamberg is one book I have read from cover to cover and will refer back often when working on my photography projects."},{"Title":"Digital Art Photography For Dummies","review":"I know Matt Bamberg's writing and love his blog (digitalartphotographyfordummies.com). If you're new to photography and confused by all the terms, Matt takes you through the basics (although he says the book assumes you know the principles of photography, he patiently explains the technical stuff). If you're a seasoned pro, skip the refresher course and just enjoy the fabulous photos--which, by the way, everyone will appreciate.I'm the outgoing vice president of NLAPW Palm Springs--we were honored to be among Matt's first speaking engagements--and have seen our members create beautiful digital art photography. Thanks to Matt's book, I now know how it was done! Artists seeking to sell and exhibit their work will find great career guidance. For other shutterbugs, the book will eliminate some of those photos that you cringe at later (I know I have a few!)The image manipulation tips in Photoshop are extremely valuable. This is a terrific book, even if you've only toyed with the idea of doing digital photography.

It's so true but I did enjoy the recently published book. But this one was just not believable at all So if your looking for a book to read purchased his latest book."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I cannot believe that Shawn exists anywhere. Please tell me there is absolutely no brother out there that fit that MO. If he exist zap him back to Mars. Cheap and dumb that is so far-fetched. There was some funny scenes (the dinner and trying to duck out on paying a tab). Jocks are not all dumb and even if you find one that is leaning in that direction at least he would recognize Jesse Jackson and know that &quot;keeping hope alive&quot; is not a sick girl. As dumb as Shawn was he was still able to sleep with a knockout. What's that all about? I finished the book because I like to finish what I start. I give it two stars for effort."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I read the book thinking, this will get better. But it really didn't.

I haven't given up hope."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book is filled with holes, inconsistencies and obvious stabs of humor which fail miserably.

This book was the pits. It was written very poorly and couldn't hold the readers attention. My entire book club was appauled that this book was even chosen as a book to read. We thought we would give the &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot; a chance. I'm not criticizing You Mr. Whitfield as an overall writer, but Beeperless Remote was awful! The characters were so unreal or were just overwritten. You know how some actors' overact, that's what the characters in this book were doing in comparison. If you decide to write another Good Luck. And let's leave D.C. alone, unless you survey the &quot;right&quot; people to depict a story from. There are &quot;real&quot; people living here! Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all. Shawn Wayne had to be one of the most ignorant men on the planet! It's a shame that there are really people out there that DO exist! I couldn't even laugh at the black tie scene because it made me positively sick! This book has no plot to it whatsoever! This was a guy who was totally clueless and had the nerve to not want a woman because she drives a stick! This book gives Black men a bad name!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"The upside of Terry McMillian's success is that we now have a variety of books about African Americans. The downside is authors such as Van Whitfield get published. I purchased this book because of the overwhelming great reviews that many of the readers gave this book. However, I found the book poorly written and very unsatisfactory. I am glad that I have a variety of black writers to read and I wanted to read a novel from the black man's perspective but that does not mean I want to read or pay for trash."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I was really disappointed with this book, after all the word-of-mouth I heard on how great it was. I agree with one or two of the critics who said how it started off strongly, but then it just kinda died. I've also noticed a number of comparisons between this book and Michael Baisden's &quot;Men Cry in the Dark,&quot; which I loved. A good book will allow you to relate to the characters or at least remind you of someone you know. None of the bros I know or have ever hung out with have EVER acted with such naivete like the Shawn Wayne character. I mean, true, there's nothing wrong with being a shy bro, but come on, let's not be clueless. I did &quot;get&quot; what Van Whitfield set out to do, which was make an entertaining, light-hearted look at the dating scene from a bro's point of view. Yet and still, I just had a hard time stomaching some of the courses of action taken by the lead character."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I thought the novel to lack insight and reality, in a word it was stupid I did not relate to the main character because he could not relate to himself very immature and if you need a crack head to tell you to get a answering machine to check your messages then you are missing a few screws yourself,I could not finish the book because I would have gotten sick."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book came out over a year ago and now I know why I waited to read it! The notion that there are only 6 types of women, ruffled my feathers, but since I identified with the &quot;4s&quot;, I let it slide. However, how can a man spend an entire book JUST looking for a 6? Isn't that a bit crazy? Plus the idea that Shawn was 10 years out of the loop was far-fetching. Who says &quot;Hey Bleed&quot; instead of &quot;Wassup Blood&quot; or &quot;yes Cousin&quot; instead of &quot;Ok Cuz?&quot; It's incredible all of the slang terms he's not familiar with. The book starts well, but unfortunately ends on a disappointing note. We know from the first 2 pages that Shawn has a very large problem and on the last page - we know what that problem is. But we never know what happens with Troi and her good news or Dawn with her good news. Whitfield's &quot;Something's Wrong with Your Scale&quot; is a much better purchase than &quot;Beeperless Remote&quot; in my opinion."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I hated this book. Once I finished it, I threw it across the room. We read it as a part of a book club, and no one liked the book. The characters were dull, and the story was uninteresting. The premise was unbelievable. I am sure there are men that judge women on whether or not they have cable, but those are the pathetic losers, like the main character, who are dateless. The dialogue was poor. The connections between the characters begged the questions why and how did these people end up together. When you don't have much time, and you enjoy reading, spending time on a book like this is disappointing."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book had a slow start but towards the end it held my attention. It was hard for me to get past the first half of the book because of all of the outdated cliches and references to sports. However, the middle held my attention even though I found the main character, Shawn, to be unbelieveably naive/stupid when it came to most matters. It seemed that he was stuck in a time warp and never grew up and maybe that was the point. The ending was less than desirable because it leaves the reader with a lot of unanswered questions. I was hoping that there would be a part 2 just to find out what happens with Shawn.For those looking for a good book to read I would not recommend this one. It is slow in the beginning and has an unfinshed ending."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book was somewhat funny, nonetheless, but I guess I don't read novels in place of the Sunday's newspaper comic section. I was like, okay, get to the point. I had to question whether this was a book written for adults or adults with slim intellect. I'll probably never read another book by this author. His style is definitely not mine."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"yo this is a very funny and entertaning book. some people have too remember it is only a book. but when you read it and think of the charecters,i bet you will find one or two people that you know. thats else is whats funny. speaking as a single blackman and in the dating pool. i know what shawne wanye is going through.it is funny enough too be a movie or a sitcom on hbo or network.but just rememberit is only a comedy aint no brother like that??? or is there???"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I'll admit the guy was a joke. He was so backwards, so hokey, but he was funny. I kept turning pages to see how he'd make a fool of himself next.

Peace and love, Breezee"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Mr. Whitfield has a winner! This book was so funny, although the author expected us to believe that a Black man in America could be as naive as Shawn Wayne!!! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and am buying his next book as well. It was smooth even reading and I was not even offended by the &quot;list&quot; of women's descriptions. Thanks Van for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I thought the book was really funny!

This book was too funny!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I have read like 2 chapters and already I find it too dumb for words. I think I came to this conclusion because of reading the reviews from you all. This really made me biased, I was hating the book even before I read it. You may ask then why read the book?

I did not like the main character at all although I feel that some guys do think the way this character does. The only thing I found intersting was his numbering system (personaly I'm a 4).

It had me in stitches!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"My mother said that if you can't say anything good don't say anything at all....-----------------------------This book could only appeal to the ignorant. I'm sorry if I've offended anyone but if you can relate to a man meeting and having a coversation with a woman that's married and involved with another man. Then she tells you that she sees you as a possible meal ticket, you are definately a sad individual. The rating scale could only be applied to SIMPLE women and would only be used by simple men. Sorry but I suggest you take your money elsewhere because he GOT me!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I would love to know where this guy lives. Could there really be a guy out there this naive. Don't get me wrong the book was o.k. It could have been better with a better character. Shawn(the main character) just seemed like he knew nothing about women. The mistakes he made through out the book was stupid. I think the author should Try Again."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I was hyped up and ready to get into this book. A romantic comedy? I found Shawn's naive behavior quite annoying. The book was definitely on target with the different types of women it portrayed. However, Shawn's character was too unbelievable. Unless, he lived in a bubble, there was no way that he could have been that out of touch. His basketball &quot;fantasy&quot; just took the cake. Well, I definitely will not be purchasing his next book."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I purchased this book a few years ago and it's just collected more dust than a little bit. I couldn't even finish the book."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Okay - so we are all tired of hearing about this book. I know I was. Everybody and their mama told me I had to read this book, so I did. First off, everybody should just chill and realize that a book like this was long overdue. We've been hit over the head with heavy-handed, one-sided looks at relationships for too long. This was unpretentious, light reading that never stopped being funny and never billed itself as a serious relationship book. It was FUN! I was put off at first and guess I didn't know what to make of it. The things that put me off about the book - the main character who had no clue, his obsession with ESPN's Sports Center and the larger than life dating scenes - are the main things I loved about this book. Beeperless Remote ain't Toni Morrsion, but it never pretends to be and that's what makes it so good, It claims to be a &quot;romantic comedy&quot; and that's exactly what it is. Who can read this book and not laugh out loud at the Congressional Black Caucus' black tie dinner? Who would read this book and not see a bad date or relationship they've been through? Who could get through the book and not think about a relationship gone wrong or that one special woman that got away? I know I couldn't! I laughed, laughed, laughed and laughed some more. The guy who wrote this has done something special. I've never read a book like this. It was all it was advertised to be and more. We need more books that take a lighter look at the crazy world of relationships. 10+++++"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I'd heard about this book for some time and saw that it was #1 on Emerge Magazine's Bestselller List. The hype kind of got to me, so I decided to read it for myself. It took me awhile to find the book (it was sold-out in three of my local bookstores, but one of the chain stores had one copy left, so I bought it). Needless to say, I am delighted I was able to find it. My vacation was all the better for having located and read this absolutely wonderful book. Whitfield's take on the male mind-set in dating and relationships was accurate and refreshing. While the main character isn't exactly the brightest guy in the world, it is his naivete that drives the book and leads to some of the funniest scenes and situations I've ever read. All of my girlfriends have spent hours trying to figure where they stood in Whitfield's rating system of women (1-6's) and even the author's webpage had me in stiches. We don't get enough books like this. Bright, perceptive, refreshing, wildly entertaining, very real and very, very funny. I have never laughed out loud so much during a book. Bravo to the author and bring us more soon."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"A 10 +++ How anybody can read Beeperless Remote and not absolutely enjoy it is beyond me. This book was funny, insighful and so thoroughly well written that I thought Whitfield was a well established writer that I'd yet to discover. I actually wasted my time and read Micahel Baisden's Men Cry In The Dark, which left me crying about why I wasted my time on such a pathetic, poorly developed story. GIVE ME MORE Van Whitfield!! Shawn Wayne is hilarious, your writing is superb and you have opened my eyes to just how good a first-time author can really be.!! Beeperless Remote is the bomb!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Though it started off very strongly and comically, my interest in &quot;Beeperless Remote&quot; waned after each chapter. Several times I thought to myself that the lead character was too stupid and naive for his own good. Some of the situations he ended up in, he brought upon himself. And, isn't frustrating for a reader when they can't even root for the main character of a story? Though not the worse of first efforts by a new author, I've read better. I'd recommend Michael Baisden's &quot;Men Cry in the Dark&quot; for a more mature, much funnier, in-your-face portrayal of the dating scene from a man's point of view."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Most fiction marketed for the African-American audience only offers the woman's point of view. Normally, it is the woman who is valiantly searching for Mr. Right but she has to go through several Mr. Wrongs. It was refreshing to see it from a man's point of view, and the trials he has to go through. The book was hilarious! I would read it on the Metro and people would stand over my shoulder just to see what I was laughing at. I gave the book to my brother to see if he could relate and I still haven't gotten it back; he's passing it around to all of his frat brothers! This book is definitely a winner; I can't wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.

I am a Black woman. It's not easy seeing yourself and your contemporaries through the eyes of brothers who have been there. I know some of these women. (Heck, I've secretly BEEN a few.) Van Whitfield has captured the male angst of the dating scene and laid it all out for us all to see. The book was very clever. I'll never look at my friends who attend the Congressional Black Caucus Weekend or who watch ESPN the same way again. Turnabout is fair play. &quot;Beeperless Remote&quot; is a funny, in-your-face-look at some male-female relationships. But that's just the humble opinion of a 6!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Tasteful, articulate and hilariously funny! What a refreshing account of dating from an African-American male's perspective without the typical stereotypes involved. &quot;Beeperless Remote&quot; is so unexpectantly humorous, because if your single and dating, you've run in to (or bearly escaped with your life) some of the same situations no matter if you're male or female. After having read the book I also found myself pondering where I lined up on &quot;Shawn Wayne's rating system&quot; (and I also found myself catagorizing my friends)! I've found myself to be a definte &quot;6&quot;. If you don't know what a &quot;6&quot; is, read the book! :-"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"We are lucky that Van Whitfield decided to share his comedic wit with the world as well as the minds of men. Comedy is so subjective but he has found the right formula to make us laugh, and it works so well in Beeperless Remote. This book is without a doubt, one of the best I've had the opportunity and pleasure of reading in a long time. I could not put it down. I've attended the CBC convention and I am sure I've seen several hundred Shawn Waynes, and many 1 through 6's. This book begins to explain some of problems we women face when it comes to dating men and looking for &quot;the one perfect man God put on earth for every woman.&quot; Unfortunately, Whitfield also has us women down pretty good too. I use to be a &quot;2&quot; now I'm ready. I called the phone company today so they could hook-up my Beeperless Remote answering service.I can't wait to see what happens in the sequel. V.W., thanks, and keep up the good work"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Van Whitfield has written a very humorous book that will be talked about in many social circles. If you are a single man and like sports and women and are undecided about which is more important, than this book is for you. Whitfield's description of women on his 1-6 scale just about gives you an indication of what you're in for on the dating scene. All I can say for the single men is read the book and start looking for your 6!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Holy Cow! I too am an avid reader, like another reviewer I do try my level best to finish what I start. It was a 1998 Book Group choice and I just thought all the derogatory stuff was over the top. I may be some naive white girl, but I just thought it very unnecessary. I was very disappointed that it was a 1998 choice. I belong to 2 book groups and I had said that I was going to read this at the last meeting of one of them, but I plan to let them know that it's just not worth it. It offended my sensibilities. I guess I just don't get the black mentality or something, but I would not ever want to be spoken to the way the women are spoken to and referred to in this &quot;book&quot;. Plus Shawn was so incredibly CHEAP!!!! What an insecure dud this guy was! I'm sorry, I just thought this book was drivel..."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I really enjoyed this book until the end. When I pay money for a book, I'd appreciate an ending (I'm funny that way.) I went along with Shawn's ignorance and naivete (it was fiction.) I found it to be very funny and easy to read, but I don't appreciate not getting an ending. After spending my hard-earned money, Mr. Whitfield should send me the ending free of charge...federal express! I shouldn't have to wait a year and spend more money! Ugh!!!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book was okay, with a few light moments, but I wouldn't read it again. Shawn was a little too naive and cheap for my liking (He's never heard of Jesse Jackson and he lives in DC. Give me a break!)It was easy to read, but it left a lot to be desired.Keep trying Van, you'll get better with time."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Outstanding book? I don't think so. I agree w/the person who submitted the review below and asked if Shawn Wayne (the book's main character) was supposed to be a brotha of the '90's. As I read this, I thought the same thing. I never thought anyone on this earth could be so stupid as Shawn was. True, there were some scenes that were funny, but shouldn't I be laughing WITH the characters and not AT them? I can just hear people reading my personal review and saying, 'don't take it that seriously, it's just a book.' But to them I say that when I lay money out on the table to purchase something, I want the product to be worth my while, and this book simply was not. I took a friend's recommendation and checked out another book on relationships from the man's viewpoint, called &quot;Men Cry in the Dark.&quot; It's written by Michael Baisden and has characters I related to alot better. Perhaps, next time Mr. Whitfield!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"And I thought Terry McMillan was a hack! Well Van Whitfield wins the hack writer crown hands down. This mishmash of trite characters, cliched plot tricks and too-dumb-to-be-believed ending was not worth the paper it was printed on. Perhaps people not looking for something too &quot;deep&quot; might enjoy it, but as a reader who likes to be challenged, I was sorely disappointed. The only good thing about the book was my realization that in all my years of dating, I've yet to meet someone as patently stupid as the main character Shawn Wayne. Thank goodness!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Is Shawn supposed to be a man of the 90's?

Michael Baisden's book was more timely."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I surrendered to the hype surrounding this book, and wish I had not. I would not recommend this book. Shawn Wayne, the lead character, had to be one of the nerdiest, most unbelievably naive characters in contemporary fiction. After all the hype, I was expecting to delve in and read a book where I was supposed to relate to the lead character. Sorry, I was NOT feeling this book."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"To each his own, but I have NO idea why people chose &quot;Beeperless Remote&quot; over &quot;Men Cry in the Dark.&quot; My book club read both books, and the &quot;Men Cry&quot; book wins hands down to me. Shawn Wayne was a complete idiot. I sat there thinking to myself that there CAN NOT be brothas out there this stupid. True, &quot;Men Cry&quot; had some grammatical errors---but so did &quot;Beeperless.&quot; I was so disappointed, because the leader of the book club had hyped it up so much, comparing it to Terry McMillan's &quot;Waiting to Exhale.&quot; The ending to &quot;Beeperless&quot; is really what got me. I'm not player-hating, but maybe next time, Mr. Whitfield. Thanks for reading my review, one and all.

But the book description sounded interesting, so I gave it a try. I'm glad I did! I thought that Shawn, while incredibly stupid for his age, was a sweet, honest, and lovable guy. His quest for his #6 was filled with some funny dating experiences, which he took in stride. I actually found it refreshing to read about a black man who was sincerely looking for a good woman to share his life with, instead of the usual mack daddy characters that are featured in many of our books and movies. I was very happy to see Shawn finally find his #6, even though Troi may have put a strain on his new found love with her &quot;good news.&quot; I'd love to read a sequel to find out if her &quot;good news&quot; is true and if it destroys his chance at happiness with Dawn. For all the people who gave this book bad reviews, I have to disagree with you. I thought Shawn's story of dating in the 90's was funny, funny, funny. I finished the book in a day. I'm very glad I purchased it."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Nevermind that this book is belabored with clunky pop-culture references. Nevermind that the plot -- as protagonist Shawn Wayne might put it -- is as thin as a triple-sliced wafer. But this story fails the plausibility test big-time. Shawn Wayne isn't simply a dim bulb. He's beyond clueless. He just ain't for real, and I don't mean ficticious. On the one hand he's astute enough to devise an intricate rating system for women. On the flip side, he's 99% dense on all matters excluding sports. He can recognize a Glock and its specifications, but to him Jesse Jackson is just some guy he saw on cable sports TV. At a Congressional Black Caucus function, Jesse intones, \\"Keep hope alive!\\" Shawn's response: \\"Who the hell is Hope?\\" And with its revisionist history, seems \\"Beeperless\\" tries to create a Black urban Forrest Gump.I want my money back!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I read this book and must admit that it took me a while to get into it. i though it was rahter silly at first, but actually it was readable.

Overall the book was good, but the ending left me hanging and lookng to see if there was any more pages."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"&quot;Beeperless&quot; received mixed reviews; some STARZ members found it entertaining, while other more serious-minded members thought it was rather silly. If you want a good laugh, check it out! If you are looking for more substance, check out something else. Overall, STARZ rates the book at 3 1/2 stars mainly for its entertainment value."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"With all that I'd heard, I relly expected this book to be a male version of Terry McMillan. NOT!! This is more like Eddie Murphy/Martin Lawrence meets paper. Sometimes extremely silly, but pretty good for a laugh. There were too many things in the novel that made me think, absolutely not real. No man could exist for thity-two years and be as clueless about life as Shawn Wayne. As a matter of fact, personally I believe if a woman had written this, she would have been exiled from the black community. Of it's redeeming qualities, this book is entertaining enough and the individual situations basic enough to use with highschool kids as an entree to dating and relationships or something of that nature."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I thought &quot;Beeperless&quot; was hysterical. Those of us with a sense of humor recognize the exaggerations and extremes. For a first effort, I think Mr. Whitfield did a remarkable job in bringing Shawn to life, much like E. Lynn Harris' &quot;Basil&quot;. For those who didn't enjoy &quot;Beeperless&quot;, I recommend you give &quot;Something's Wrong With Your Scale&quot; a chance. Even though I enjoyed &quot;Beeperless&quot;, &quot;Scale&quot; is much better."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I thought this book was extremely funny. I did find it hard to believe that anyone could be that cheap and slow. He seemed to have the mental capacity of Forest Gump. I thought his classification of women was interesting but I was not at all impressed with the ending. I read this book at I read his latest book &quot;Somethings wrong with you scale&quot;. That book was great and was expecting better but didn't get it."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book was horrible. I kept thinking it was going to get better, but it was just silly. I dont want to dog the brother but dont quit your day job. I understand that his new book is really good, but I just dont have the heart to give him one more chance."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote had me laughing so much my son kept coming into the room asking, &quot;Mom, what are you laughing at?&quot; That's how funny it is. I loved the character Shawn. He was so innocent and unaware. I cared about Shawn and wanted to find out what happened to him. Van Whitfield does not disappoint. He has a very unique style of writing, his books are not laced with profanity, he even offers wisdom through Shawn's mother. I recommend this book highly to anyone who likes Eric Jerome Dickey or Terry McMillan type books."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I just finished this book. I could not put it down! I found most of the scenes to be extremely funny. Actually I found it very hard to believe that a guy, Shawn, could be that CHEAP. Reading books by male authors is very insightful. It helps to see how the male mind works. Shawn's logic and reasoning was just unbelievable. I can't wait to read Van's next book. If you enjoy reading and love to laugh, YOU WILL LOVE this book. The black tie event was by far the funniest part of any book that I have read in a while."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote was great. I never knew that men classified women the way Sonny classified women in Beeperless Remote. It was also good to know that men go through the same issues that women go through when it comes to dating and relationships. The one thing that I did not like about Shawn was how he allowed Troy to use him. There were times when I wished that I could just shake him into reality. I look forward to reading other works by Mr. Whitfield in the future."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote RULES! Speakin' for the brothers, we feel this book is all of it. It was an easy read about some straight-up bugged-out drama. I'm not EVEN feeling the negativity about this book. The writer basically just told it like it is and had the mad skills to keep me and my peeps laughin' like fools. Big ups to the brother who put this piece together - he represented. And on the Jordan tip, he said MJ was the greatest player who ever played anything - what was the LA poet head readin'? Exhale cuz. Lakeside in the house!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote lived up to all the hype it has received. I felt that the writing was particularly strong and that Shawn was a well developed, though very cheap character. The author has a strong, distinctive voice that most will appreciate because the book is such a smooth and consistent read. Overall, and perhaps most important, this book was hilarious like no other I've ever read. I can't wait for the sequel. I truly enjoyed this funny, funny look at relationships in the '90's."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote is the funniest book I ever read. Like one of the reviewers below, I bet that the people putting this book down have some SERIOUS problems with men. They are trying to front like they've never met a guy like Shawn, but they probably have. Shawn never lets on to the babes that he's cheap; just like the guys who take them out and have a calculator blowing-up in their heads when the chick is ordering like she hasn't eaten in a month. Anybody who couldn't get with this book has issues. Get a life, make a botty call somewhere, lighten-up and have some fun!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote is the best book that I have read. I don't call myself an avid reader, but since reading this wonderful book, I've have taken up reading again and have purchased and read ten books in the last month. The author has a strong voice and an inviting, conversational style that I'm sure most will enjoy. The book was absolutely funny and very accurate in it's depiction of women - I should know, I've been one for nearly 57 years and I must admit that I saw myself, my friends and siblings many times over in the author's description of the 6 types of women the main character talks about. I could hardly believe this was his first book and cannot wait to read future work by Mr. Whitfield. I did have one problem with the book, and that was that it had to end. If you read one book this year, and for those who like to laugh, smile and enjoy light, breezy prose, you couldn't do much better than this."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Thank You Van Whitfield! Finally, someone has written my life story and the stories of many brothers I know. Beeperless Remote was so real, so funny and so cool that I've read it three times. I can pretty much guarantee that the people who seem to have such a problem with this book, also have problems with brothers in general. And the men who act like they don't want to recognize, probably are all mixed-up about who they are. Beeperless Remote didn't get to be one everybody's must read list because it's a bad book. It got there because it truly represents what brothers are going through these days. So everybody can just stop player-hating Whitfield, because he's all of it. It's such a trip to see all these fake women bad mouthing this book, because when Waiting to Exhale was tearing men down, women were in heaven. And when Terri came back and &quot;Got Her Groove Back&quot; sistas didn't want any part of her; I know because I bought the book for a buck-fifty last week! Anyway, quit tripping, because the BROTHERS LOVE BEEPERLESS REMOTE! The book is like that and we're tired of being dissed by petty women who don't want to admit that their problems with this book are related to some knucklehead they're dealing with. I bet you all are 1's! If you don't know what a 1 is read Beeperless Remote and laugh at yourself. I'm out."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I loved the book! It was a quick read for me and it left me wanting more. As I was reading, I could visualize the characters and the scenes. Some of the scenes left me reminiscing about my own experiences in young adulthood while growing up in the DC area. The book was marketed as a romantic comedy and I strongly believe that the author accomplished his goal of addressing the modern day dating forum in a light-hearted and humorous manner. The main character, Shawn, is annoyingly frugal and naive; however, this is what made him funny as a character. Some find Shawn to be a little unbelievable, but Shawn is a mesh of some of the men that have crossed my path during the dating process over the years. I can't wait to see how the saga surrounding these characters unfolds."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"My fiance &amp; I read this book. To be honest with you, the book was great except for the ending. We are ready to know if that baby is his or some other lover's baby. Whitfiled certainly hit home with both of us about dating. Ladies, remember when you were in high school and no one wanted to date the nice guy? Men, do you remember that woman that you would just fall for until you found out the truth about her? From reading the other reviews it seems as if there is no sense of humor from many of you. This book was not written as a &quot;How-To&quot; guide. The book was written out of shear fun to look at the world of dating. We would definitely reccomend this book. We're anxiously awaiting the conclusion."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but the negative comments attributed to this book is way off base. This book was not meant to be a serious how-to book but is in fact a humorious, fictional account of one brother trying to get it together. To compare to a serious nonfiction work is ridiculous. This book was fun, fun, fun. And as it has been said most of have been or encountered the six types of woman. We should be able to laugh at ourselves and enjoy a good read without over analyzing and putting a brother down. I give it a 10+"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"As a Black woman of the 90's it was good to see a man's point of view of women. I really enjoyed this book. It opened my eyes to alot of questions that had been going around it my head. I disagree with the critic who said that Shawn Wayne was an idiot. This book showed me how a man can appreciate what he is taught by his mother. I am a single Black woman raising 2 sons. It's good to see that his mother had an influence on his life, but in retrospect, the character also jumped on the band wagon a bit too quick. You can't just assume that the first person you meet or right after you meet someone that they are going to be your perfect mate."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Get A Life! Isn't it strange that nearly every negative review on this page mentions Men Cry In The Dark? It appears that Whitfield and the brother who did Cry In The Dark have a little tiff going. It's a shame because both are decent writers who have done decent work. But their books are so different, there's no use comparing them. Men Cry In The Dark is a serious book about serious situations. It has some funny moments, but all in all, it's a good book based on some pretty interesting themes. Beeperless is just flat out funny. It's hilarious! The reviewer below didn't get it. Yeah - it is okay to laugh AT the character. Shawn brings that out. He's funny, the things he has to deal with are funny and the way he handles and responds to them are absolutely funny and that's what makes this book so good. It was thoroughly entertaining and very insightful to boot. The book jacket said the book was a romantic comedy. That's what it was. It's like going to a Jim Carey movie and getting upset because he wasn't Paul Newman quoting Shakespeare! Neither Whitfield or the brother who did the other book need sympathy; their books are popular and are selling like crazy. But running one down to promote another falls on the ridiculous side. We're lucky to have these brothers writing from entirely different perspectives with distinctive and provocative styles. Men Cry In The Dark works and Beeperless Remote is all of it. Get a life a read another book. These guys probably don't have a problem with each other - why should you?"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I received this book for Valentine's Day and finished it already. It was fabulous. I could not put it down and thought that it couldn't keep getting funny, but it truly, truly did. I would recommend this book for most anyone (I am a married, white female, so I don't think I fit the demographic) because it is so very well written and the storyline and characters are somewhat universal in their appeal. This is a great read full of hope, energy and promise. I look forward to more work from Mr. Whitfield and hope that he is able to maintain his uncanny sense of style, wisdom and humor."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book was funny, funny, FUNNY! Some of you people need to buy stock in GET-A-LIFE.COM! How can a book that's not serious at all, have people getting so serious? I thought fiction was fiction - so why are people trying to make Shawn out like he's some guy sitting beside them on a subway? Dude was funny and this is a funny book to the bone. I can't wait for the sequel. Bring it on!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD, BUT IT WASNT. IT HAD A FEW FUNNY PARTS, BUT FOR THE MOST PART, THE BOOK DRAGGED AND IT BORED ME. I STOPPED READING THE BOOK SEVERAL TIMES AND ONLY PICKED IT BACK UP BECAUSE I SPENT THE MONEY FOR IT. THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS VERY NAIVE AND I JUST COULDNT GET INTO IT. I AM ABOUT TO READ MR. WITFIELD'S OTHER BOOK AND I HOPE IT IS BETTER THAN THIS ONE."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"It has been a long time since I have read such a bad book. This book was horrible. I am sure the writer was trying to make his character funny, but all he suceeded in doing was making him stupid and unrealstic.The only good thing that I have to say about this book is that I didn't buy it I borrowed it from the library. Please save your money, and don't buy this book. I like books that are funny, but Van Whitfield is not capable of making a book funny and realistic. All of his characters are too sterotypical and you find yourself saying no one is that stupid. His next book is not any better so save your money on that one also."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book was ok, but it was too long and dragged out for my taste. The idea of the story was good, Shawn was a very funny character but sweet at heart. But this just was'nt my kind of book, I don't think I will be buying any more of Mr.Whitfield's future works."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"THis book was for those fo us that have dense senses of humor. It wasn't even funny. THe main character, Shawn, was ignorant instead of funny. THe book jumped from scene to scene with no leadway. Dialouge was ridiculous and this rating system of women is dirogatory (but sometimes true). THen the ending leaves you hanging like a leaf in the wind. You never really connect with any of the characters. Stupid, STUPID book. My opinion, is to buy it on audio, maybe it sounds better then it reads!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote showcases the work of writer, Van Whitfield. However, I draw the line at referring to his work as anything but mindless minutia. Whitfield's novel is trite and shallow, which is also reflective of the main character, Shaun. I can only say that for the few mini-seconds of guffaws, I felt that I had wasted money purchasing this book. I can only hope that Mr. Whitfield will redeem himself and his writing talent in the very near, and I do mean very near future."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I haven't finished this book as of yet and I don't think I will. Although I heard his latest book, &quot;Something's Wrong With Your Scale&quot; is a lot better, this time I will keep my money in my purse and get it from the library. I hope Mr. Whitfield is like a fine wine and did get better with time.."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I had high hopes for this book based on the title. There are probably 100 good stories out there telling about the antics of a man, his beeper, and meeting women. The character Shawn was so naive that I ( honestly ) thougt maybe he was developmentally disabled. His funniest (and most believeable ) character flaw was his stingyness and how he got by in life. The funniest ( although still unbelievable )part of the book was when he couldn't dress for the black tie occassion, and when the lady at the same gala event flipped her wig ( so to speak ). If you are recovering from surgery( like I was) then this book is good enough to get you through the ordeal."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book is filled with many holes. For starters how is it that a person, an African American, living in D.C., would not know Jesse Jackson. Secondly, Mr. Wane's entire basketball career is quite questionable. I mean this is suppose to be fiction, not FANTASY!!! There were just too many distractions in this book that kept me from focusing in on the plot, which once when I found wasn't worth discovering anyway. I think that the idea was a good one, but somewhere between Mr. Wane chasing after Troi and his fairy tales of &quot;smoking&quot; the Greatest Player to set foot on a basketball court in the NBA the story totally flopped! Sorry Mr. Wane but your story just doesn't wash. Lets just hope there isn't a sequel to this literary mess."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This book was a total waste of money, time and effort. The guy in the story is so slow and dense, it's pathetic NOT FUNNY. Only one thing that I sort of, kinda of liked was the ending. The ending was better than the entire book."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Van Whitfield has written a great romantic - comedybook that keep my interest all the way through.I enjoyed reading Shawn Wayne's point of viewon the dating scene ,what he is looking for andthe situations he had to go through to get them.This book will have you laughing from beginningto end but expect some surprises along the way.Both men and women should read this book sowe can understand each other in the dating arena.V.W. keep the books coming !!!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"My boyfriend started reading this book before I did, and he said it was trash. But thinking he didn't know what he was talking about, I started reading it. Let me tell you, I got through the first 5 chapters, and that was torture!! The main character's best friend is a crackhead...I should've known then. The main character is annoying and obnoxious. If you really, really, really want to read this book, borrow it from a friend, or the library."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I am so very very very disappointed. I was tired of the normal drama books I was reading and I wanted to enjoy something light. I was pleased by the reviews and searched for this book for over a year. Some people referred to this book as hilarious and I was anxious to laugh. Ha! That is such an exaggeration. This book was terrible. It was difficult to read because the main character was so annoying. The author thought by making his character dense that would get a laugh, but he went over board and made him brainless. Which made me as the reader angry."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I must say that I disagree with the majority of bad ratings for this book. I enjoyed this hilarious novel from beginning to end. I honestly believe that Mr. Whitfield intentionally made his character Shawn as stupid as possible. It's called comedy people and remember this is FICTION! Unfortunately there are Shawn's out there who deem it appropriate to wear a clip on tie to a black tie affair. The Kmart, Blue Light Special was too much.Mr. Whitfield let me say that I praise you for going out on a limb to write a &quot;romantic comedy&quot;, and making it as funny and entertaining as you've done. For anyone wanting something light and funny on a Saturday night, this book is a must read! I'm looking forward to &quot;Something's Wrong With Your Scale.&quot;Peace!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Let me start off by saying that anyone buying this book looking for some &quot;deep messages&quot; will be extremely disappointed. This book is just a light, sort of mindless book that I felt was meant for laughs only. Some of the reviewers complained about the main character, Shawn, being totally unrealistic. I personally thought that the author intentionally made Shawn &quot;stupid&quot; because it made the book funnier. Basically, if you are looking for something to pass the time away and you would like to laugh along with way, buy this book. If you want some serious reading, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT AS AFRICAN AMERICANS, WE SHOULDLEARN TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. I GIVE PROPS TO ANYONE WHOPUTS FORTH THE EFFORT, WHILE ALSO PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT THERE TO BE RATED. I MUST SAY THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK, SHAWN, IS A BIT UNREAL. COME ON NOW....A CLIP ON TIE FOR A BLACK TIE AFFAIR AND SO ON AND SO ON. WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON. EVEN TO OUR MOST SHELTERED PEOPLE CERTAIN THINGS ARE NATURAL. HAVING SAID THAT, I STILL CAN NOT SAY THAT THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. ALTHOUGH I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE, IT KEPT MY INTEREST FOR THE MOST PART."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Ok this character is totally naive. There is no way any man on earth can be this stupid. But you know that is what made the book so funny.

YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"After reading SOMETHINGS WRONG WITH YOUR SCALE, I was expectingsomething funny and I got it.

Can't you just imagine one of the Wayans Brothers as Shawn in a movie!!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"For a first try, this book was EXCELLENT!!! Aside from Shawn's 'dufus' behavior and gross exaggerations at times (which are permissible, after all it is a work of fiction!!!), and extreme parsimoniousness, Shawn is an innocent, working, drug-free, sensitive, non-abusive, non-exploitative, and non-player brother who I eventually fell in love with. Did Troi miss out!!! Many sisters would love to have a man like Shawn. Just goes to show why only Shawn goes to the movies. After all, we are tired of the &quot;ghetto-fication&quot; type movies - a-la-Flyy-Girl - with teenage sex, dope dealers and users and basis ghetto life; no strange coincidence!!!!Van Whitfield had the literary balls to not only rise above the 'ghetto-fication' and 'black-xploitation,' but also to keep it clean. He also had the artistic abilities to blend romance and comedy. Although we women might not like it, his 6 categories accurately and vividly described us.I also highly recommend his new book, &quot;Something's Wrong With My Scale,&quot; where Van displays his literary diversity and maturity with another sweet, lovable and sensitive guy - Sonny Walker. Van, keep those SW characters coming!!!!!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Nevermind that this book OD's on metaphors ad nauseam.Nevermind that it's belabored with clunky pop-culture references.And nevermind that the plot -- as Shawn Wayne might put it -- is as thin as a triple-sliced wafer.But this story fails the plausibility test big-time.Shawn Wayne is not your ordinary dim bulb. He's beyond clueless. He just ain't for real, and I don't mean ficticious.On the one hand he's astute enough to devise an intricate rating system for women. But on the flip side, he's 99% dense on all matters excluding sports?He can recognize a Glock and its specifications, but to him Jesse Jackson is just some guy he saw on cable sports TV?At a Congressional Black Caucus function, Jesse intones, &quot;Keep hope alive!&quot; Shawn's response: &quot;Who the hell is Hope?&quot;And with its revisionist history, seems &quot;Beeperless&quot; tried to create a Black urban Forrest Gump. Didn't work.Whatever's supposed to be going on, whatever the point -- I don't get it.I'm gettin' my money back!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"OK, OK! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I'M NOT SURE WHAT REACTION THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE READER. I MEAN DOES VAN WHITFIELD ACTUALLY THINK THERE IS A MAN THAT IS THIS STUPID (OR ANY PERSON ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH FOR THAT MATTER). I HOPE AND I PRAY THAT HE IS JUST WRITING THIS FOR FUN AND MAKING FUN OF THE CHARACTER, BECAUSE IF HE WEREN'T, THEN I WOULD BE TRUELY UPSET WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER SHAWN. I CAN NOT BELIEVE HALF OF THE STUPID COMMENTS THAT HE MAKES. AND TROI? OH GOD, WHAT KIND OF WOMEN WERE FALLING FOR HIM. FOR THE REVIEWER WHO THOUGHT SHAWN WAS THE SWEETEST GUY THAT ANY WOMAN WOULD WANT (THINK AGAIN SISTA BECAUSE SHAWN HAD TO BE THE DUMBEST BROTHA ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH). I CAN SEE WHY SOME REVIEWERS WOULD SAY SOME PARTS OF THIS BOOK WAS FUNNY! BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN THE FUN AND GAMES ARE OVER AND &quot;NOTHING&quot; REMAINS BUT THE TRUTH. AND THE TRUTH JUST HAPPENED TO BE THAT THIS BOOK (IF ONLY LOOKED AS A COMEDY AND NOTHING ELSE) HAD TO BE WRITTEN FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ENTERTAINMENT. THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE LEARNED BY READING THIS BOOK. IF YOU DON'T READ THIS BOOK WITH AN OPEN MIND AND KEEP TELLING YOURSELF (IT'S A COMEDY, IT'S A COMEDY (REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER)) OR YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF VERY VERY ANGRY WHILE READING THIS BOOK. I CAN'T SAY I LIKED OR I HATED IT. I TRIED TO BE NEITHER NON-JUDGEMENTAL NOR CRITICAL (WHICH I KNOW I CAN BE). HOWEVER, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK (IF YOU ARE THE TYPE OF READER THAT I AM), UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK THAT HAS NO ACTION OR PLOT, BUT ONLY FOR THOSE READERS THAT ARE STRICKLY IN THE MOOD FOR USELESS HUMOR."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I had written a review for this book before I finished it, and I didn't have kind things to say. Now that I finished it, I can say, my words were justified. This is the most unrealistic thing I ever read! Yes, most programs on television are untrue, but you can find some truth in the characters. Shawn's character was so untrue that it sickened me. How could a black, educated brother in the 90's be so stupid? I'm not saying I know all the &quot;black vernacular&quot; out there but if you use a word it in a sentence and listen to how it's used, you can pretty much figure out what someone trying to say. (Note: that how I teach my children new words, I'll use a word in a sentence, and if they don't know what the words means, I'll ask them what do you think it means, how did I use it in a sentence.&quot; Sorry about that, I had clarify what I was speaking on) Anyway, like i was saying, I don't know all the slang and lingo out there, but if you use it in a sentence, you can pretty much figure out what someone is saying. How is it that this man, in this day and age, and not to mention he has a friend (a best friend) from the streets, and he was so totally clueless. I realize it's fiction and supposedly &quot;a comedy&quot; but I found this to be totally unreal, and not funny at all!Readers, don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews of this book, I was kind of hesitant to buy it, but it sounded like an interesting story, so I gave it a try. I am so glad I did! I thought Shawn's story of his quest for his #6 was hilarious. Shawn was incredibly stupid, but he was a sweet, sincere guy. It was refreshing to read about a young black man who was looking for a healthy relationship with a woman, instead of the usual mack daddy images that are in many of our books and movies. I was very happy for Shawn when he finally found his #6 (Troi had me fooled too). I hope that Troi's &quot;good news&quot; doesn't destroy his relationship with Dawn. Perhaps Van will write a sequel to let us know how it all works out for Shawn."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Not as funny as I thought it would be. Not really funny at all actually. The first time I cracked a smile at anything written by the author was page 66. I was so surprised I found something funny that I noted the date, time and page number.The main character is hard to relate to and the book becomes pretty silly when you get towards the end. As a guy, I understand the fascination with sportscenter, but everything relates back to it to the point that it is just weird. Also, every time the character does a 360 windmill dunk, someone dies. He tells a story about his life and the whole restaurant starts crying, the whole story with Michael Jordan sounded like an unfunny make believe story from a drunk at the local bar that the author expects us to believe.In short, the book is not very funny and diverts from reality to the point that it is hard to keep turning that pages."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I enjoyed Something's Wrong with Your Scale, but I think I like this one better. I found the \`clowning' funnier...

It's really great when characters make light of their situation... as in this one... with a matched verve as in pointing out the weaknesses in dating 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's and so on's.Even at this late date it was both a relief and a pleasure to read Beeperless Remote... taking me back to what it was like dating in the 90's!

I should have left this book sitting on the shelf. I regret buying and cracking open this book!!! This was simply stupid and I will NEVER buy a title from this author ever again. I have a great sense of humor and love to laugh, but the antics in this book were so far fetched, I could not find the humor in it.Shawn is a cheap, naive brother who \\"wants a babe who has cable.\\" If he can't see ESPN at her place, she is no good to him. He has women placed in 6 categories.1--\\"I just got out of a really bad relationship.\\"2--\\"I'm not interested in a relationship. I just have friends.\\"3--\\"What is it you said you do for a living?\\"4--\\"Men are dogs.\\"5--\\"My biological clock is ticking. I need a man.\\"6--\\"I'm single, I'm available, and, yes, I'm interested.\\"Shawn is hoping he will find his number 6. Shawn's best friends are Donnie, the drug user that could sell anything except drugs, and Kelly the always broke, but fashionable sister. During one of his dates he pays $50.00 for a lunch with a woman he had been out with before, and did not like. She orders a whole pie to take home. He meets Jasmine who is hot, married and has a boyfriend. Both live in Philly. Shawn is clumsy with the ladies and has no game what so ever. He says stupid things that make you want to throw the book across the room. Which I wanted to do several times while reading this selection.He meets Miss Troi a classy woman who has major problems with Shawn leaving his socks on in bed. I had no idea what the big deal was over the socks. Maybe Shawn has cold feet, maybe they were ugly and needed to remain covered. Shawn is not pleased when Miss Troi takes his $5.00 socks and throws them out the window. In Miss Troi, he thinks he found his six.There is a part in the book where Shawn thought a nickel bag actually cost a nickel. Shawn could squeeze blood out of a penny, that's how cheap he was. How do you grow up and not know that Black Tie means you have to wear a Tuxedo? Shawn was so beyond dense it really irritated me. I did not find his lack of knowledge to be comedic at all.During a speech that Jesse Jackson gave, he kept asking \\"Who is hope?\\" How do you live in DC and not know that Jesse Jackson says \\"Keep Hope Alive?\\" At this point I almost put the book down for good, but being the glutton for punishment that I am, I kept reading. This book was way too silly for me.Troi asks him \\"Are you hiding something?\\" his response is \\"Do you mean like under the table or out in my ride.\\" At this point I'm beating my head against the wall at the stupidity this character exudes. He does not know that baggage stands for relationship issues, not baggage in the literal sense. This book was such a disappointment. There is no way that a guy can be that STUPID, and DENSE!!!! This is a book you borrow from the library, not buy and keep as a part of your book collection. Because after reading this book, you will either toss your copy or do what I did. Donate it to the library.The sequel of this book is Dad Interrupted."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Opinions are like noses. Everybody has one. Many people didn't like this book, but I thought it was excellent. A sparkling entertainment that tickled the funnybone, excited the mind, and touched the heart. I think that the people who slammed this book and said it was silly and unrealistic have never been unpartnered-yet-wanting-to-be-partnered. So much fiction about people searching for love deals with a lady looking for her Dashing Caballero. How refreshing to read about partner-hunting from the GENTLEMAN'S viewpoint! One part that touched my heart was when Our Hero met a woman that he grew to ADORE, and then finds out that she thought of him as very nice social company and that's it. (&quot;I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm just looking for a fun break&quot;) I know where THAT one's parked! Been there, done that. Am waiting for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Even though the worst thing you can do to me as an avid reader is have an open-ending, I really enjoyed this book. He just needs to make a sequal to this thing before I have an anxiety attack."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"This was the worse book I have ever read! Please do not buy this book! This book makes me wanna sue the publisher for passing off this novel as anything but what it should be, liner for a cat's litter box. It is not funny as some people suggest, it is pathetic. There is no way there is a guy out there who can somehow figure out a rating system for woman but doesn't know what a black tire affair is. (He thinks it means he needs to wear a black tie arrgh)Maybe if your I.Q is as high as being legally drunk then you may enjoy this book. I didn't and I will never, NEVER, never buy another book by this author."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I liked this book. The only drawback was the main character's ignorance of general knowledge for his age. His thinking was too shallow and too often, lacked reasoning. Because of that, the story was unrealistic. Nonetheless, it had some great laughs."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"Beeperless Remote is a funny, funny book. As I look at the crazy reviews of this book, I wonder just what some of these readers were looking for. This was an entertaining look at what men go through in relationships. Some readers on this page seem to insist that this book be evaluated as some kind of classic literature, when it works so well as what it is - a wonderful piece of contemporary fiction by a talented and imaginative author. I look forward to more work by this author soon - Beeperless Remote is GREAT!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"You know how you watch a comedy and you have to watch over again because you laughed so hard that you missed half of it? That is this book - imagine passages so funny, you have to put down the book and just LAUGH! I mean side splitting, belly holding, snorting as you try to catch your breath (while people around you are sure you have lost your mind) LAUGHTER!!!This is the perfect book to give to your brother, son, uncle - any guy in the dating scene - and, as a female, it is a scream to read about one's self - and all your girlfriends.... here is hoping my number 6 is out there,,, gotta go, sportscenter is on!!!!"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"While being extremely entertaining and providing easy reading material, this book also contains some very positive messages. It's very REALISTIC and I could easily recognize my friends in some of the characters. For the ladies out there, this gives us a great opportunity to take a long, hard look at ourselves and possibly improve our 'rating' to a 6. Compared to some of my other favorites such as Terry McMillan, Bebe Moore Campbell, Nathan McCall or E. Lynn Harris, Van Whitfield has finally given me the point of view we can expect from a 'normal' man. It's a got-to-read for sure !"},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I went to the FICTION section of the bookstore to purchase this book. It was crazy funny, it made me laugh constantly. Who said fictitious characters had to be real? The main character Shawn was real in this BOOK, and he was funny to read. This book reminds of fall lineup of TV comedy, just makes you laugh. It is ok to laugh! What would romance be without comedy. The 1-6 was real though. I truly enjoyed reading this book. Van Whitfield, thanks for steppin' out into the world of comedy. I'm waiting for the sequel."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I thought the book was ok. However, nobody could be that clueless. I mean, this guy was out of order. I believe that the sequel will be better. At least I hope so. I can say, the end made you want to run out and get the next book just to see how everything worked out."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I finished this book on Sunday and could not wait to write a review. First off, I belive this was a good attempt by Van Whitfield. But he needed to give his character a little more depth. I understand people don't always keep up on the latest slang terms, but this brother was entirely CLUELESS!!! The part about the black tie pissed me off. I thought this character was old enough to know that if a dinner is black tie, it means wear a tux!!! Even the backwoods people know this much. By the end of the book, I was hoping that the author made this guy mentally impaired. That would at least account for some of his dump, stupid actions and comments throughout the book. Although the black tie thing was bad, the condom thing was even worst! Shawn, get a grip. I was actually very angry with this character by the end of the book. I often pass my books along to my friends and family, I wish I could send this one back to Amazon."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK BEEPERLESS REMOTE. AT FIRST IT WAS HARD TO GET INTO, BUT AFTER A WHILE I DIDNT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. I COULD RELATE TO THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN WASHINGTON DC AND THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM. ALSO, THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS A DOWN TO EARTH BROTHER. THIS BOOK WILL DEFINELTY BE TALKED ABOUT AND RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"A great look at how men enter into relationships. Very entertaining and never misses a beat. Van Whitfield is on the money with this book. Ladies and Gentlemen you have to pick up this one. It's a great read. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"I have been so used to reading about women and the things that men put us through, that it was a treat to read a book about men. Strangely, enough men do actually think (no ofense meant). I saw how Shawn Wayne went over things in his head. However, I was a little lost towards the end because I felt Troi should have stayed where she was, but what is a life about a man if he does not get caught out there. I have to give it to Mr. Whitfield for creating an ending like that . I would love to know what other people thought the ending should have been. I look forward to the next book by Van Whitfield. Thanks."},{"Title":"Beeperless remote: A guy, some girls and his answering machine","review":"My book club selected this book as its book of the month and all I can say is WOW!! What a book. I laughed, I cried and then laughed even more! First of all, the writing is so visual. I can really picture the characters in the scenes depicted in the book. Then there are the scenes. I loved the scene where one of the women threw his socks over the balcony. Or how about his crazy dream about the heart. And if you haven't heard about the black-tie dinner yet - suffice it to say, that alone is worth the price of the book. You will laugh out - loud; I GUARANTEE IT!!! Beeperless Remote is a special book. It's not serious fiction by any stretch, but it succeeds at what it's supposed to be - a romantic comedy. We need more books like Beeperless Remote and more daring writers like Whitfield. I can't wait for the movie!!"},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"I believe that the path to a well-rounded child is the truth. Too often we sensationalize and sugar-coat the truth when it comes to our kids. This book is a good example of the way things are. My favorite tale from this book would have to be &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, and it will be the first tale I read my children when they are born. Mr. Anderson was a firm believer in drama mixed with the hard knocks of real life.Here he has just transformed them into a fantastical story that every child needs to be told. The elements of the story are very powerful, from the loss of innocence to the loss of love,and sometimes we need a good dose of something that isn't wholesome. I recommend this book to everyone, children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"This is the first translation of Andersen's tales to capture his true voice -- try it and compare to any other translation and you'll see. I hope Penguin has Tiina Nunnally do all the rest of his stories soon!"},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"It's difficult to convey cultural humor and wit from one language to another, but Nunnally's is the best translation I've read for Hans Christian Andersen's fairytales."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"This is an important classic of children's literature, illustrated with charm by the renowned Arthur Szyk. It's a small volume that feels good in the hand. To encounter Andersen's story telling ability is to be drawn into eloquently told stories, and to sometimes encounter surprising images and turns of thought. The color illustrations seem inspired by Persian miniature paintings, and are charming, lively, humorous, quirky, and stunningly executed. The artist used a variety of tools: First a sketch, then basic shapes in gesso or tempera, then on top of those colors he applies lines and details using pen or a fine brush. The petite and gorgeous color images are rather well produced by the printer."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"I had this volume in my youth and read it practically every night. It's a wonderful compendium of Fairy Tales -- one should pair it up with a similar copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales. Some parents would object to \\"violence\\", etc., in the content but I will be reading these stories to my own grandson as soon as he is old enough to listen. You can't go wrong on this one."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"It has beeb said that Hans Christian Anderson's tales...though fullof thought and enchantment, can be scary in the extreme. \\"The SnowQueen\\", \\"The Red Shoes\\"....so many of these stories have strongstories and stronger morals -- but are often too scary for childrento read.Of course, not every story is like this. The enchanting \\"The UglyDuckling\\", and to a slightly lesser extent, \\"Thumbelina\\", (at leastths has a happy ending!), are two of the tamer tales...and perfectfor children. The majority of Anderson's tales, however, can bescary for children -- and the fascinating, though too-often scaryillustrations in this book, by justly famed illustrator ARTHURSZYK, show why!Mr. Szyk's hyper-realistic drawings, with large eyes, and emphasison bulging stomachs, pursed lips, and scared or evil expressions,add much to the general atmosphere of these tales. They aretrue masterpieces of the illustrator's art -- but, for children,(and even for sensitive adults), may be just a bit to scary forcomfort. They do, however, fit in with Mr. Anderson's tales verywell. One wonders what would have happened, had these two gentle-men -- whose lives were separated by almost a hundred years, butwho seemed to have the same sensibilities of great empathy for theunder-privileged, a hatred of evil and unfairness, and greatcompassion and hope for humankind, in spite of it all -- had beenable to meet and talk.Well, in this volume, the reader has the next best thing. Thestories of Hans Christian Anderson, with Illustrations by ArthurSzyk! Perfect together -- but be warned: these are VERY intense\\"fairy-tales\\", combined with perhaps even stronger illustrations.A connoiseru's Anderson's Fairy Tales, for sure -- but recommended(strongly) only for adults, (and children), who are not prone to nightmares, dueto sensitive emotions. Read, and look at, with delight -- but alsowith care!"},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"nice book, nice translation. only problem, i was expecting the illustration to follow the style that is on the cover but it doesn't. it just looks like ink blots to me, but whatever... still a nice edition.edit- on further inspection, the ink blots i referred to are paper cuttings done by anderson himself. ah, now i get it :D"},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"Book came on time, and is in excellent shape.

Although its message is essentially Christian, its means of getting there is staggering, Surrealist and far from dogmatic. There is an Alice quality to the heroine's narrative as she seeks her abducted playmate, full of singing flowers, helpful crows and robber barons - the songs of the flowers are full of sexually loaded and enigmatic imagery. But the word-pictures as a whole are haunting, the blazing sheen of the snow, with the suggestive reds dotting it throughout. The final puzzle is worthy of Borges. Wow."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"What came under this title was actually J.M. Barries book Better Off Dead. Ihave tried To talk t customer service by phone and email. No service at all.

You could say it may because I'm alittle old for fairy tales but in every description I read they swear the book is for children and adults alike. Uh, I'd have to disagree.- The stories are so predictable (as in it follows the exact plot of the story that we've heard since we alittle listened to our parents) a.k.a. It doesn't bring anything new to the story.....or- It's based on a folklore I've never heard of and in effect the message of the tales fall flat.The only reason I'm keeping the book is for when I have kids a long way down the road I can pick a few of the stories out to read to them. That is, only SOME of the stories are even really appropriate to read to a child.This book is okay, but doesn't deserve as much hype as the introduction and translator give it."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"This collection of fairytales is both lovely AND beautiful thanks to the illustrations throughout, a must have for fairytale collectors."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"I realize most wouldn't get this for a younger child but my 7 year old loves this collection of stories.

Even at an early age I recognized the superlative quality of Arthur Szyk's illustrations. They're weird, grotesque, even frightening, visually mirroring the unrelenting morality of Andersen's universe, in which the evil are harshly punished for their wickedness (\\"The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf\\", \\"The Red Shoes\\").Unlike the Grimms' Marchen, which seem largely of pagan origin, many of Andersen's stories are cautionary tales with a decidedly Christian slant (\\"The Garden of Paradise\\"). Andersen was homosexual, and we are likely seeing his own sense of guilt being worked out in these stories.Andersen also had a sense of humor. \\"Great Claus and Little Claus\\" (which might have been adapted from a folk story; I don't know) is blackly humorous to the point of being downright sick -- and is laugh-out-loud funny. When my mother read to me as a child, it was her and my favorite.In addition to B&W; drawings, most of the stories have a full-color plate. The one for \\"The Nightingale\\" is magnificent. You wish you could get a poster-size copy.Unhesitatingly recommended."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"The reason to buy this book is to visit and revisit ( in my case) the beautiful, haunting, and old world Europe visions of the fairy tales as rendered by Arthur Szyk, one of the greatest artist/ illustrators of the 20th Century.

Some were used in Grammar School readers in the past. The background of these stories tell about life in those days (\\"The Little Match Girl\\"). You can compare these stories to the original and unexpurgated Grimm Brothers' collection of traditional folk stories (some of them too terrible to be used in school literature). These twenty-nine stories are interesting to read by an adult. Can you understand what you may have overlooked as a child? [Were they originally written for children?] How many are now unintentionally laughable (\\"The Princess and the Pea\\")? [What kind of life would a Prince have with a Princess who had such a \\"delicate skin\\"?] One page said this book was \\"Approved by Librarians And Educators\\". What is the purpose of these stories? Are they better than the original folk tales passed on from one generation to another before the 20th century?

We all know there aren't enough useful publications for us music teachers.I was a little disappointed after reading this book. Though Bell does touch on lots of topics like maintaining a personal life, dealing with parents and fundraisers, I expected to take more away from it. It was a quick read, mostly because of its journal style--separated by months. I wanted more advice as I'm approaching my first year of teaching. I've found many other of the books in this category had more information to take away from them. This one had potential, but never really took off.I credit Bell for sharing her thoughts and feelings, and would like to see a sequel with more information to be taken from it.Until then, I would recommend this as a quick read, but be prepared that there aren't any fireworks or epiphanies."},{"Title":"Confessions of a First-Year Maestro: A Guide for Your First Year of Teaching","review":"I do not have an educator's background, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found Catherine Robertson's book to be both informative and entertaining as well. I frankly never realized what a complex juggling act a teacher has to deal with each school day and throughout the school year; her students, all with different interests and abilities, their parents demands and expectations, the pressures of the school administrators, each pulling her in different directions.Ms Robertson was able to bring these teaching challenges to life by use of her actual daily journal entries. And her retrospective follow up comments on each entry gave an added fresh perspective with the additional benefit of both time and her gained experience.Her tenacity in the handling of the daily ups and downs of teaching, all while maintaining a positive attitude, is certainly impressive. She always seemed to be able to see the brighter side and humor in otherwise stressful situations. She obviously enjoys teaching music and looks forward to the challenges it bring each day.Her book is both easy and fun to read. I would encourage any new teacher or person interested in going into teaching, to read, enjoy, and learn from Ms Robertson's experiences."},{"Title":"Confessions of a First-Year Maestro: A Guide for Your First Year of Teaching","review":"This book is an excellent resource, especially for those educators who are new to the &quot;real world&quot; or are just about there. Kate Robertson does a superb job of integrating her reflective journal from her first year teaching (which has very minimal editing -- what you see is the original journal) with reflections. One feels as if the tasks that are involved with being a music teacher are made easier just by knowing that music educators everywhere face the same challenges.This book also sets a good example to be a reflective practicioner. Keeping a journal is probably the best, and easiest, way to reflect on daily teaching activities and improve as a teacher.Having just met Ms Robertson, I know that she is very sincere in her teaching and the publication of this book. I urge all music educators to read this book -- even mature teachers will be able to gain knowledge from it.Included in the back is a resource guide that has some forms, etc., that can be modeled after for use in your own classroom.My one complaint, and it doesn't deserve any less stars because it deals not with the content, is that GIA typically tends to release books without catching every typo. Mistakes do happen, but all of the books I've gotten from GIA have had some sort of glaring grammatical error. Like I said, though, this does not detract from what Kate wrote in this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a First-Year Maestro: A Guide for Your First Year of Teaching","review":"Robertson illustrates the ups and downs of teaching in this fun, lighthearted book about teaching.

I recommend this VERY HIGHLY for all future music educators and for anyone who has a child taking instrumental music in school! Well done!!"},{"Title":"Saint Bernadette Soubirous, 1844-1879;","review":"The biography, translated from French, is probably the best book available on the life of Bernadette Soubirous overall and on the events of 1858 in particular, which may have little to do with the later elaboration of the site and certainly have nothing to do with any possible commercialization of it. Those events of 1858 cannot go out of date; the real subject is contact with the eternal.

Because the book is very hands-on, mistakes can be very confusing to students. In particular, Windows 95 does not always respond the way the book indicates it will, and I wonder if the book were written with a WIN95 beta in mind. Still, the problems are not major, and the book doesn't have nearly the typos of other ITP publications such as &quot;The Illustrated Series.&quot;Overall, the book is an excellent introduction to WIN95 and maintains a good balance between factual information and lab exercises that students find interesting. Also, the full color screen shots add strong visual appeal.Instructors should keep in mind that some exercises toward the end of the book have the student change hardware and network settings that can really screw up the computer, especially if they make a mistake along the way. Beginning students should probably work only ! halfway through the book."},{"Title":"William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings","review":"I probably would never have found this book if it hadn't been for an accidental combination of two occurrences that somehow came together: One, I have developed a great affinity for the Library of America selections; and Two, I had taken a trip to Philadelphia and intervening heavy rain prevented me from finding Bartram gardens, a place I knew I would enjoy visiting because of my dedicated love of all things foliaged, green or flowering. I had slight background on his father, John, and in the search among ancestral treasures of the Revolution, the trip to Philly evolved to reality.I expected a good read, if slightly staid, stoic and filled with mostly observations about the fauna and flora of early eastern half of the United States, complete with the official latin headings on all. In that regard, it is to be admitted that there is quite a lot of that, due to the very nature of his quest into the wilderness.It was integral, but a very small portion overall; instead, I also found far beyond what I expected - in a wonderful flowing, articulative narrative regarding travels through the East and South as it was when most of it was yet unspoiled land, the incredible numbers of birds, fish and animals as well as the beautiful descriptions of the forests and meadows decorated with flowers of all denominations; much like the Lewis and Clark Journals brought to us about the journey to the Yellowstone in search of the Northwest Passage, by John Bakeless - one of the books I used to keep handy on my nightstand to read again and again for the sheer wonder of what was once - right in my own corner of the world . I have always been captivated by people who could paint pictures with words; and this beautiful novel is one of that kind.Two of my favorite spots in this journal involved more than his desire to document and classify: first, his session with a horde of alligators that he inadvertently camped among one evening before he discovered he was in the midst of their favored feeding and fighting haunts. The story he spills about THAT begins on page 114 and by the time the reader has finished with it, they are overcome with laughter and all thoughts of this being a book filled with nothing more than drawings and compositions of foliage have vanished. Without warning, and in the last act of desperation as an alligator is busily and noisily accessing the canoe, Bartram's only means of transportation out of the jungle, this mellow and gentle botanist grabs his gun and dispatches the alligator without remorse; proof positive that even the mildest of spirit will act out of character if the pinch is right.The second, page 216, details one of the most ingenious plots devised yet by woman to get even with man through his weakness - as one gets over the initial rush of abject astonishment, the next question that comes to mind is \\"and these are supposed to be \\"primitive\\" thought processes?\\" It involves liquor and the Indian peoples he encounters, the many different facets of their lives, his non-judgmental observations, which is truly a pleasure; and that is all I will reveal about the subject as it's too good to ruin for another reader who may be contemplating it.For those who have a fond regard for our heritage and for the outstanding individuals who thought enough of it at the time to write of it for us, in and around the fight for survival, the lack of many necessities that might have made it easier to focus on putting it all down on paper, it will be a reminder that the ones who blazed the trail for the rest of us were an unselfish breed apart. I look for such individuals every day and don't see many of them. That we had so many of them once, all in the right place and time, continues to be a wonderment to me. The question and answer section with his peers in the concluding chapters is remarkable.Highly recommended not only as an excellent source of historical botanical information, but as a tale of high adventure accomplished most often solely alone, his only company being the land as it was, the wild and beautiful animals, birds and fish, the spectacular woodlands, the occasional white trader, and last but certainly not least, the natives that instinctly accepted and recognized him as a remarkable individual too nice to kill.For those interested in this sort of historical narrative, a splendid companion novel about the Western half of the country - rather than the Eastern half - when it too was young, would be Francis Parkman's \\"The Oregon Trail\\", also a Library of America selection."},{"Title":"William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings","review":"This is the best edition of Bartram that is available today.Like all Library of America volumes, it is an attractively designed book with a ribbon marker."},{"Title":"William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings","review":"The miscellaneous writings include (among other writings) Bartram's responses to carefully worded questions about Creek and Cherokee Indians.

The book is full of details of the Southeast's flora and fauna, river systems, geography, and the Indian civilizations of the time. But part of what keeps me reading is the beautiful writing; his descriptions and reflections of everything he encounters reads like poetry. Even his chronicles of day to day activities evokes images that make one long to be one of his fellow travelers. For example, on page 64, this is how Bartram tells us that it's getting dark out, and it's time to find a place to camp for the night:\\"The glorious sovereign of day, clothed in light refulgent, rolling on his gilded chariot, hastened to revisit the western realms. Grey pensive eve now admonished us of gloomy night's hasty approach. I was roused by care to seek a place of secure repose, ere darkness came on.\\"To me, this book should have been required reading in one of my high school or college classes, either in Alabama History, American History, Biology, or even Literature; but then again, I may not have enjoyed it as much then as I do now."},{"Title":"William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings","review":"This volume offers a fine selection of William Bartram's writings, including several short miscellaneous essays, which editor Thomas Slaughter happily included.

From his Philadelphia farm, Bartram sparked a revolution in England by exporting all manner of native American plants, shrubs, trees and flowers. So extensive were his exports, that English landscape gardens in the 18th century largely were populated with American plants and trees. Similarly, Bartram was at the center of the vigorous trade within the U.S. involving American and foreign plants and trees. He interacted extensively with numerous of the founders, including Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Adams and Franklin in developing American agriculture.This handy Library of America volume contains Bartram's accounts of several of his expeditions all over America in search of new plants and trees. Over the years, Bartram evolved from a largely unlettered farmer into a first-class botanist with an unmatched familiarity with American foilage. This volume contains, in addition to two long accounts of his travels, a whole slew of his essays as well. His interests were not limited to plants, for he also wrote on Indians, animals, and other topics. The book is illustrated with a plates drawn from a variety of sources (other than Bartram) which adds important context to his writing.The 700-page volume manifests the usual Library of America quality. It contains a useful chronology of Bartram's busy life, and illustrates his travels with a helpful map. The editor has included valuable notes to explain unfamiliar references in Bartram's writings. I also found the 50-page plus glossary of plant and animal terms to be much welcomed. A fine index rounds out the volume. As is always the case with LOA books, the production quality is outstanding, with fine paper, excellent typography, and durable binding.Hopefully, this valuable collection, in conjunction with the Wulf volumes, will move William Bartram and his truly extraordinary contributions out of the dark recesses of history into the bright sunlight he so richly deserves."},{"Title":"William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings","review":"I didn't read it , but my son, the Forester has worn out his older copy."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Love reading abut her!

A mystic who communed intimately with God, she had experienced a vision of \\"a most beautiful crystal globe, made in the shape of a castle, and containing seven mansions, in the seventh and innermost of which was the King of Glory, in the greatest splendour, illuming and beautifying them all. . . outside the palace limits everything was foul, dark, and infested with toads, vipers and other venomous creatures.\\" This castle became Teresa's metaphor for the soul. \\"Interior Castle\\" explores each of the seven mansions in great detail. Her intended audience were the sisters who made up her cloistered religious community, however her insights offer much to the world at large.Teresa wrote reluctantly and felt that she had little to offer that had not already been said. She believed that \\"Our Lord will be granting me a great favour if a single one of these nuns should find that my words help her to praise Him a little better.\\" She focuses on the beauty of the soul and laments that we spend so much attention on our physical body and so little on the divine spark that is within.Teresa focuses on gaining self-knowledge, but not in the way we in the 21st century interpret that term. For her, self-knowledge means coming to know the soul within. It means understanding our dependence on God and gaining humility by acknowledging that we are nothing without Him. The route to self-knowledge and entry into the interior castle comes through prayer and meditation. As one progresses through the mansions, one comes to know and long for God more and more and to reject the world and its attractions. Teresa encourages the beginner in prayer \\"to labour and be resolute and prepare himself with all possible diligence to bring his will into conforming with the will of God.\\" She also offers encouragement: \\"If, then, you sometimes fall, do not lose heart or cease striving to make progress, for even out of your fall God will bring good.\\"As one makes her way ever deeper into the heart of the castle, increased spiritual consolations and trials become par for the course. Many (perhaps even most) do not reach the most inner mansions in this lifetime. Teresa is quick to point out, however, that \\"the Lord gives when He wills and as He wills and to whom He wills, and as the gifts are His own, this is doing no injustice to anyone.\\" Indeed she cautions her readers to never believe that they deserve any gift that the Lord bestows upon them, nor should we set out to obtain any consolations or mystical experiences because \\"the most essential thing is that we should love God without any motive of self-interest.\\"Teresa was truly granted amazing gifts of insight and experience from God. While we may not share in her experience, \\"Interior Castle\\" offers a unique perspective into the divine within each of us.

Her castle is the God within, and there are outward mansions that must be penetrated to get to this inner treasure. Each mansion is a deepening of one's knowledge of God, and a step further away from one's capture by externality and the world. She describes these inward steps, and leads one onward to union with God (or God carries one onward - at first it is our efforts, than it is God's). Beautiful and illuminating."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"The Interior Castle (or The Mansions as it is known in Spain) compares the soul to a castle filled with many rooms. Each room is an aspect or stage of the soul, and one can progress into and out of each room. The more into the center of this castle one goes, the more his soul is conformed to the will and ways of God. It is the most interior chamber of this castle in which God dwells. The book describes the soul's way of making it to this chamber. St. Teresa focuses her work towards the nuns of her convent, and because of her personal relationship with them, the book is written in her typical conversational tone and humility. She only loosely adheres to the analogy of a castle. However, it contains several morsels of enlightened spiritual knowledge and insight. The principles that are expounded by Teresa testify to her intimacy with the Creator. She spends a great deal of time on mortification and prayer. Written in 1577, it still contains spiritual wisdom that can be applied today to both Catholics and Protestants."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This was a hard book to read due to MY expectations. I was expecting details where St. Teresa gives almost none. One realizes why in the long run, simply that to give the details of HER experience would limit your thoughts on how God would interact with you.

I rate it 5 stars though because in the end one realizes that to find out what she knows, YOU are going to have to tread a likewise path...no freebies here. Therefore St. Teresa (really the Holy Spirit) is telling you no more than you need to know to become interested in following the path, and subsequently trodding that path. For those of us who are so used to getting on the Net and finding the easy way to solve a puzzle...well, God doesn't publish the Cheat Codes...."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Teresa of Avila is one of the more remarkable figures in the history of Christianity. Living in a perilous time, when the Roman Catholic church was suspicious of anything that might develop into Protestant heresies and schisms, she walked a fine line between obedience to the political structure and obedience to God. It is often the case that mystics and spiritual giants are at odds with church structures of the day (this is rather ecumenical, reaching across Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant lines).Teresa lived at time shortly after the explusion of the Jews from Spain (which occurred in 1492). Her own family was a converso family; hence, there were different dimensions to the wariness of the powers in the culture toward her activities. Being a woman at the time didn't help matters, either, as she defied the stereotypes in several ways, by seeking education and leadership opportunities, all the while being part of the discalced Carmelites, who strive to cultivate humility and poverty.Teresa's life was not an easy one; she suffered physical ailments and political difficulties. However, she was also a sought-after advisor, spiritual leader, and fairly prolific author. Her various writings made her famous in her own day, but the towering achievement that has lasted over time is without doubt 'Interior Castle'. This text shows a spiritual journey on the inside, developing different walks through aspects of spiritual life and prayer developed in seven stages, or mansions.The life of prayer is the castle, with seven stages of development. The first three stages are pieces that humankind can practice with their own efforts; the final four stages are those which are given from God, and God alone - no human effort can reach these places. The first mansion looks to the striving toward perfection of the human soul. The second looks to different pieces that give spiritual edification; sermons, readings, prayer practices, conversation, etc. The third mansion sets forth discipline and penance, striving toward good works while reaching for self-surrender. These are not easy stages, but are within the realm of human possibility.The fourth mansion begins the mystical journey in earnest at the behest of God. Here Teresa uses a metaphor of water and a fountain to explain the soul, and explores graces as spiritual consolations. Here is the Prayer of Quiet. The fifth mansion continues the theme of water, looking toward a Prayer of Union, which leads naturally to the sixth mansion, where the soul is prepared for a marriage of sorts, as intimacy with God increases in the soul. The seventh and final, most interior mansion, which is heaven itself; metaphors here used include two candles joining as one, and the falling rain merging to become one with the river.These mansions are based on visions; Teresa was compelled to write them down at the order of her ecclesiastical superiors, for she herself thought to keep them to herself. Her writing was done very late in her life, but even so, she took care to be humble and as non-threatening as possible; modern readers might be a bit taken aback by the self-deprecation of Teresa, and the general stance she seems to take towards women. This may have been an attempt to make an authoritative text written by a woman more acceptable to the male-dominated hierarchy of the time. However, not all of Teresa's humility should be dismissed or argued away in this manner. She is reputed to have said, 'There are more than enough books on prayer already,' in response to being told to write her visions. This might have been true (then and now), but few reach the power that Teresa's 'Interior Castle' achieve."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Interior Castle is a wonderfully profound and insightful book enabling the reader to gain a better understanding and perspective of the \\"levels of faith&quot; and a soul's journey toward union with God.

The journey of the soul is toward the inner most chamber of the castle where God resides. St. Teresa describes the features and characteristics in each of these mansions. One might think of the mansions as &quot;spheres of relationships&quot;; relationship of love of God, love of our neighbor, and love of ourselves. As one moves from mansion to mansion, these relationships of love grow and change just as the features, characteristics, and experiences of God in each of the mansions grow and change.

The purpose of a translator, as I understand it, is to faithfully convey both the meaning and the context of the author's words, ideas, and message. In other words, to \\"do no harm.\\" Ms. Starr wreaks havoc with Tersa's message, which was obviously difficult enough for her. I agree with other reviewers that by substituting \\"innocuous\\" or \\"politically correct\\" or words with which Ms Starr feels are uncomfortable for modern readers, she transforms both the meaning and the context of Teresa's message and often digresses into total nonsense. Perhaps she is Jungian, and that is fine; however, Teresa does not use the vocabulary of \\"unconsciousness\\" to represent \\"sin.\\" And the substitution is meaningless, most particularly becuase the unconscious is something of which we are unaware. Teresa stresses the necessity of the awareness of sin. Therefore, the substituion is a sentence such as \\"Make us alert to our unconsciousness and may God protect us from it\\" makes no sense on two levels. One: you cannot be alert to something of which you are unaware and secondly, why would you ask God to protect you from something he gave you and something you need (the unconscious), but for other reasons.It is sad to see this transformation and distortion of meaning of one of the world's great mystics.If I want to read Ms Starr's spiritual views, I would be pleased to do so in an essay of her own.

Allison Peers. Based on the prose alone, the Peers translation is far superior (and includes translation footnotes to explain where a word is difficult to translate). But the Starr translation fails much more miserably on account that an obvious liberal/\\"progressive\\" agenda is involved, wherein words like \\"sin\\" and \\"evil\\" are changed to be more suitable to contemporary sensibilities. Even \\"Our Lord\\" is changed into \\"Beloved.\\" In other words, the translation wants to change this great Catholic mystical work into something more along the lines of New Age or Neopaganism. This is completely unacceptable and a misrepresentation of St. Teresa. Another reviewer who accidently posted his comments on the Peers translation page had this to say about Starr's translation (I disagree, however, that her translation is \\"lovely\\"...it's dumbed-down prose, in my opinion):Mirabai Starr, the translator of this work, describes herself as a \\"Hindu/Buddhist/Jew translating the Catholic saints\\". Her translation is lovely, but quite different from the original, as she substitutes St. Theresa's own words with some that are perhaps more \\"universal\\". Below are Ms. Starr's own words:\\"I opted to minimize references to the inherent wickedness of human beings and replace such terms as \\"sin\\" and \\"evil\\" with \\"missing the mark,\\" \\"imperfection,\\" \\"unconsciousness,\\" \\"limitations,\\" and \\"negativity.\\" \\"Mortal sin\\" is \\"grave error.\\" I call \\"hell\\" \\"the underworld\\" and the \\"devil\\" the \\"spirit of evil\\".

As a Carmelite nun in the 1500s, she was gifted with a vision from God to write this beautiful book. In this book, the soul journeys through seven rooms, each with a lesson of spiritual wisdom that draws us closer to God. In a ringing refutation of Pascal's bargain, she says that, \\"the most essential thing is that we should love God without any motive of self-interest.\\" Love of God is an end unto itself, and we should not love God because we dread the pains of Hell and the loss of Heaven. The similarity of the Interior Castle, the controlling metaphor, to Jesus's quote that the \\"Mansion of My Father has many rooms,\\" is beguiling and appealing.

Imagine Hamlet where nunnery is \\"translated\\" as \\"spiritual retreat.\\" Imagine Hamlet without \\"slings and arrows\\" as that would be way too violent.

To her credit, she admits to her butchery of the text. As cited by other reviewers, she provides a list of the words that she changed; Lord to Beloved, devil to \\"spirit of evil,\\" sin with \\"missing the mark,\\" etc.However, all her semantics serve to do is to force the reverse translation by the reader, and it grew quickly tiresome to mentally exchange \\"Lord\\" for every instance of \\"Beloved.\\" Not to mention the sneaking suspicion that Ms. Starr had monkeyed with the text to a greater extent than she admits. But, again, you have to admire Ms Starr's honesty in her statement that \\"[Teresa] would have approved of my boldness, if not the results.\\" This amounts to an admission by Ms Starr that her modifications substantially change the meaning of Teresa's text.Despite all the linguistic hijinks, Starr's translation of the Interior Castle is not \\"Free of Dogma\\" as is its claim. The concept of the soul is dogma. The redemptive suffering of Christ is dogma. Teresa's patterns of prayer and life are rooted in dogma. To attempt to pen a \\"dogma-free Interior Castle\\" is like attempting to write a \\"math-free Calculus\\".What the attempt to \\"free Teresa from the cage of Christianity\\" reveals is a complete denial of Teresa's life and devotion. Whatever pressures Teresa may have felt at the hands of the inquisitors and the Church heirarchy, Teresa was voluntarily a Carmelite and she deeply believed in all sorts of inconvenient things. Teresa cannot be separated from Christianity - nor can she be separated from Catholicism.In the end, far from being dogma-free and modernized, Starr's interpretation of Teresa's Interior Castle is simply castrated, lobotomized, sterile, and confused."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This is mystical theology.

Some are highly technical and some are emotional. As the readers might have guessed, this book leans heavily toward the latter. What Teresa de Avila is aiming here in her memoir is the fullness of enjoyment in prayer. But the methodology she proposes is not only complicated and confusing but also mechanical and unbiblical. She views the soul as a castle with many mansions. The outermost mansion is described as full of temptations. She uses the imagery of poisonous loathsome reptiles molesting the soul as she strives in her attempt to reach the innermost mansion where the perfection of a full union with God, whatever that term means, is achieved. This level of complexity is unheard of in the Bible. In Mat 6, Jesus teaches one to enter his or her chamber without the need to show off and there enjoy a sweet communion with God through a simple prayer, yet loaded with significance. Indeed, the Lord's prayer contains the outline of what prayer should consist of; praise and adoration, petition and repentance. Something worth pointing out in this book is the terms sweetness and consolation. It is hard to get their clear definition due to the haphazard nature of Teresa's notes where she seems to keep jumping from one subject to another and return to the previous subject and unnecessary commentary that she is not worthy or smart enough to talk about this matter.What I gather is follows. Sweetness is the joy that the soul experiences as God opens her mind to behold his glory through the revelation of Himself in Scripture, usually through the reading, thinking, and praying of the Word. It consists first in understanding, then rejoicing over it as the soul embraces it in her head and heart with gladness. The soul then responds back to God in agreement, praise, repentance or resolution to follow up through certain actions. The experience of sweetness involves the use of mental power more, not only in thinking and understanding the revelation of God, but also in responding back to Him with joy and praise. Consolation is the comfort that the soul receives as an expression of the love and compassion of God. Unlike sweetness which usually happens during the thinking, reading and meditation of Scripture in prayer and worship, consolation can happen anytime. For example, one can be overwhelmed by the sense of the presence and compassion of God during meal time or while walking or driving. It is the moment where God seems to make his gracious presence suddenly felt to bless the soul immensely. There is a major similarity between the two. Both come from God and result in joy, peace and comfort to the soul, as well as gratitude to God. The only difference I can think of is the occasion where they are felt. We may even say that sweetness is a subset to consolation because it is also possible for the soul to receive consolation as she is blessed with the understanding of God's Word.This interesting coverage on sweetness and consolation is pretty much the only highlight of this book. I caution the readers against following Teresa's methodology. In fact, I discourage anyone from reading it at all. There are better books out there on prayer; one of which I recommend is \\"A Call to Spiritual Reformation,\\" by D.A. Carson."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Classic literature from the 16th Century.

St. Teresa makes an extraordinary effort to describe the indescribable--what it feels like and looks like to commune with the Lord--using vivid examples from her own experiences of where she went right...and where she went wrong.

I had some in-store credit and a coupon, and I had heard this was a solid work by St. Teresa of Jesus (Avila), so I bought it.This is one of the best books I have ever read! I now say to persons, \\"I'm in a 7-Step spiritual program\\" (i.e., St. Teresa's seven mansions). St. Teresa is this very winesome writer who is furiously working on this treatise late at night after being neck-deep in this massive and highly controversial reforming movement in 16th century CE Spain.So she comes to this work all tired and exhausted physically, but her zealous spirit for the things of God just shines right through the pages! It is literally a window to the soul of this great woman who walked her talk. She also is very attractive in that she is, in one sense, this very ordinary woman who has believed a story that God can do great things through those who will live for Him totally. As such, you don't get the sense she's this super-intellectual giant like Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Calvin, and so on who is also struggling with their intellect, but rather she's the \\"plain Jane\\" sold out for God.After reading this book, I've made St. Teresa of Jesus (Avila) my honorary mother as I couldn't be more honored than to be her son in some small way.

Living in a perilous time, when the Roman Catholic church was suspicious of anything that might develop into Protestant heresies and schisms, she walked a fine line between obedience to the political structure and obedience to God. It is often the case that mystics and spiritual giants are at odds with church structures of the day (this is rather ecumenical, reaching across Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant lines).Teresa lived at time shortly after the explusion of the Jews from Spain (which occurred in 1492). Her own family was a converso family; hence, there were different dimensions to the wariness of the powers in the culture toward her activities. Being a woman at the time didn't help matters, either, as she defied the stereotypes in several ways, by seeking education and leadership opportunities, all the while being part of the discalced Carmelites, who strive to cultivate humility and poverty.Teresa's life was not an easy one; she suffered physical ailments and political difficulties. However, she was also a sought-after advisor, spiritual leader, and fairly prolific author. Her various writings made her famous in her own day, but the towering achievement that has lasted over time is without doubt 'Interior Castle'. This text shows a spiritual journey on the inside, developing different walks through aspects of spiritual life and prayer developed in seven stages, or mansions.The life of prayer is the castle, with seven stages of development. The first three stages are pieces that humankind can practice with their own efforts; the final four stages are those which are given from God, and God alone - no human effort can reach these places. The first mansion looks to the striving toward perfection of the human soul. The second looks to different pieces that give spiritual edification; sermons, readings, prayer practices, conversation, etc. The third mansion sets forth discipline and penance, striving toward good works while reaching for self-surrender. These are not easy stages, but are within the realm of human possibility.The fourth mansion begins the mystical journey in earnest at the behest of God. Here Teresa uses a metaphor of water and a fountain to explain the soul, and explores graces as spiritual consolations. Here is the Prayer of Quiet. The fifth mansion continues the theme of water, looking toward a Prayer of Union, which leads naturally to the sixth mansion, where the soul is prepared for a marriage of sorts, as intimacy with God increases in the soul. The seventh and final, most interior mansion, which is heaven itself; metaphors here used include two candles joining as one, and the falling rain merging to become one with the river.These mansions are based on visions; Teresa was compelled to write them down at the order of her ecclesiastical superiors, for she herself thought to keep them to herself. Her writing was done very late in her life, but even so, she took care to be humble and as non-threatening as possible; modern readers might be a bit taken aback by the self-deprecation of Teresa, and the general stance she seems to take towards women. This may have been an attempt to make an authoritative text written by a woman more acceptable to the male-dominated hierarchy of the time. However, not all of Teresa's humility should be dismissed or argued away in this manner. She is reputed to have said, 'There are more than enough books on prayer already,' in response to being told to write her visions. This might have been true (then and now), but few reach the power that Teresa's 'Interior Castle' achieve."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: The Interior Castle (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"In comparison to other translations of The Interior Castle, Mirabai Starr's is by far the most accessible, relevant, and readable.

Many of the medical personnel who were part of the German-sponsored International Commission that originally investigated the Katyn graves now appeared before the US Congress. They all affirmed the fact that they had free access to the bodies, were not influenced in any way by the Germans, and that their conclusions in front of the U.S. Congress in 1952 are identical to those in 1943 before the Germans. Ironic to the postwar Communist smear campaign directed against Italian forensic-medicine investigator Dr. Vincenzo Palmieri (Fascist!), intent on discrediting him, he testified that he disagreed with Fascist doctrine and was persecuted to some extent by the Mussolini regime for that reason. (p. 1621).Both Palmieri and Hungarian investigator Dr. Ferenc Orsos testified about their finds of the calcification of parts of the brains of the victims (p. 1600, 1619), which proved that the Katyn victims had already been dead at least two years at the time of discovery. Otherwise, the absence of insects on the bodies (p. 1735, 1797) was consistent with Soviet-caused early-spring (not German-caused summer-fall) deaths. A disturbed ring on the trees overgrowing the murder sites indicated that they had been transplanted there 3 years earlier (that is, 1940). (pp. 1493-1495, 1755). The manner which some victims were tied up suggested that they (5% of the total) offered strong resistance. (p. 1629, 1748).There is the fascinating testimony, under oath before Congress, of Boris Olshansky. (pp. 1939-1942). A Major in the Red Army, he knew Professor Burdenko through his father's many-decade friendship with the same. In 1946, Olshansky visited the ailing Burdenko, shortly before the latter's death. (Burdenko was personally appointed by Stalin to investigate the massacre and refute Soviet responsibility.) During the visit, Burdenko told Olshansky that he knew, as a medical man, that the evidence unambiguously pointed to Soviet responsibility. (p. 1941). The Burdenko Commission was forced to blame the Germans for obvious non-evidentiary reasons.Other historically-valuable information is included. An exhibit by the Polish Government in exile in London confirms that the first Polish citizens freed in the USSR as part of the 1941 \\"amnesty\\" tended to be Jews. (p. 1690).

Noting that the book was published in 1995, I assumed it must be updated at least semi-annually. Though new to the Wed I was aware that there is an enormous turnover of failing, marginal and poorly conceived sites. I assumed ,therefore, that an author would find a way to keep his/her book reasonably contemperaneous. That was sadly not the case with the book being reviewed. Of the first twenty sites randomly chosen from the attractiveness of their titles, fifteen were &quot;withdrawn&quot;,&quot;no such title&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot;. In further review of titles the record became somewhat better but never exceeded roughly 50% of sites listed and described in detail in the book.

Maybe I'm naive in thinking that such a book could be kept up-to-date in this fast moving business, but certainly something better than no changes in four years could have been done-or the book abandoned in fear of misleading naive (or otherwise unknowing) purchasers."},{"Title":"1001 Really Cool Web Sites","review":"Yes, these websites from 1995 are long gone. But this book should be called \\"1001 Really Cool Web Screenshots.\\" Since it includes an image of every site listed (granted, in black & white), it serves as an excellent thumbnail index of web aesthetics circa 1994-95, before the Internet Archive's Way Back Machine started indexing pages.

His writing shines with an intimate knowledge of the subjects at hand, and he still manages to keep the topics objectified in a manner conducive to letting the reader from his or her own opinions concerning the religious pluralism discussed in the book. He is admired by many in the field as one of the formost authorities on religious philosophy, and after having read his book, I have no doubt in my mind as to why."},{"Title":"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion","review":"Taliaferro's book is clearly written while managing to maintain an astonishingly high ratio of ideas and arguments to number of pages. It goes beyond explaining the material traditionally covered in philosophy of religion courses to include mention of many recent and interesting developments in the field. Lecturers who use less challenging texts for their introductory courses in philosophy of religion may benefit by following its well-structured presentations in the preparation of their own lectures."},{"Title":"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion","review":"The good news: \\"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion\\" is a broad, readable survey of recent analytic philosophy of religion. The author is a Christian but doesn't grind axes. The book would be good for undergraduates if supplemented with an anthology of classic and modern readings.The bad news: \\"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion\\" doesn't cover any issue in depth, even though it is more than 400 pages long. Few arguments are pursued for more than a few pages. The text often bogs down in an artificial argument/counterargument structure, reminiscent of high school debates. Contemporary philosophers like Plantinga and Mackie are well-covered, but pre-20th cenutury giants like Aquinas, Spinoza, or Hume are barely mentioned.The really bad news: \\"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion\\" exudes a sunny confidence that analytically-trained theists have lately made headway on intractable issues like the \\"passibility\\" of God. This may be the 21st century, but in some circles angels still dance on pins. At times I wanted to close the book and shout, \\"How can anyone possibly KNOW that...[God transcends time, God is perfectly free, God feels human sufferings, etc., etc., etc.,]?\\" Unless you think philosophy has much to say about these mysteries, you can take a pass on much of this book."},{"Title":"Theoretical Introduction to Programming","review":"Ok, that was just a joke. But the author is trying... Mills wants to take you beyond the low level details of any given programming language. No nifty little coding tricks. Or even cool patterns.In essence, he offers precepts that hopefully transcend the languages. Ignore \\"Introduction\\" in the book's title. The subject material he discusses tends to be fairly advanced. Going into such topics as NP completeness, the Turing Test and Godel's Theorem. Think of these topics as cultural, if you will. Rounding out your programming education.Some topics will have little bearing on your typical coding. Like the above mentioned Godel's Theorem. But other topics may well be very germane to some readers. Finite state machine, for example. Mills also sprinkles code snippets in various languages, just to make some lessons concrete for readers."},{"Title":"Theoretical Introduction to Programming","review":"When I first flipped thru its pages, the book looked very promising: it's about the theories behind everyday programming tasks that people tend to take for granted and it helps people to focus on the fundamentals rather than the latest fads. However the book is poorly written and failed to live up to its promise:1) Not a a single term is rigorously defined; important concepts are routinely mentioned in passing. I believe this is a fatal flaw of the book although the author apparently thinks its casual, conversational approach will appeal readers.2) The author has no idea at all who this book is written for (in fact he doesn't mention its intended audience anywhere in the text). On the one hand he tries to explain (rather unsucessfully, IMO) things like Turing machine and Von Neumann architecture, on the other hand he expects the reader to have already known concepts related to Haskell/Prolog/Lambda Calculus/C language/Discrete Math and machine architecture (such as register, memory and stack).3) The book comes across as an effort to show off the author knowledge rather than something that enriches the reader's understanding of programming & computer science fundamentals.Btw, the book doesn't even have a short bio of the author which made me rather curious. After a bit of digging on the web, I found out his background which explained why the book reads so foreign to me (the language is english, but the usage feels very stilted and un-natural)."},{"Title":"Theoretical Introduction to Programming","review":"If you're a programmer without a strong theoretical background then you'll find this book to be an amazing and enlightenming overview of a wide variety of deep concepts presented in readable, bite-sized chunks.

Within a year his organization, The Nation of Islam, became a focus of controversy when one of his ministers said that Jews were responsible for the holocaust. Then Malcom X's daughter blamed Farrakan for his assassination, something he denied, but sort of apologized for on 60 Minutes.This is the first good book on the \\"black muslims\\" since Louis Lomax wrote his aacout of Elijah Muhammad and Malcom X in the 1960's and is the only book written by someone who was a member of the NOI - except Malcom X's book - which is a classic.White gives a penetrating acount into the NOI. To me his potrayal makes the organization look like a cult around Farrakan. Everything in it is geared to promoting his public image and money is raised to maintain that. Much of what the NOI does is just show. The Million Man March, accomplished nothing, except to raise Farrakan money. Farrakan talks - but really does few concrete initiatives. His trips to the Middle East with \\"world leaders\\" is an example of this - all show, but no real substance. Just acting to give the appearance of being more important than he really is and to keep his followers excited about what he might do or say next.This is why Farrakan has a tendency to say something insulting - or anti-semitic from time to time - it gets him news coverage, attention, and makes him look like an important and contervsial figure. It gets him members, which is the bottom line.One thing that surpised me in this book is the shabby financial condition that the NOI is in. I would guess that one day it will eventually go bankrupt - probably after Farrakan retires or passes away from the scene. I've never seen a detailed account of the NOI business structure and finances - but here it is in this book.Although, White gives plenty of ammo for critics of the NOI I saw his book as a sensitive treatment of them. Adding some of his own story to the book is helpeful to show how/why someone would join the organization. Although some of the leaders may be rotten, many of the members are looking to improve their lives and make the world a better place, even if they have been misled.This is an important book for people who want to understand the legacy of the nationalist strain in black America. From Marcus Garvey to Elijah Muhummad to the Black Panthers to Louis Farrakan there will always be a strain of black leaders of the nationalist bent. This book is one of the best sources for understanding this in contemporary times - and in the past 20 years."},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"After spending over a decade in the Nation of Islam, I found Mr. White's experiences to be true, unbiased and very factual.What he has shared with the entire world has been the usual day to day operations of the NOI. The group is inclined to Black Nationalism and preaches a Christian mixed with Muslim mixed with Masonry mixed with Mysticism doctrine. Although the NOI has established a track record of turning around some of society's worst individuals, they ability to keep these individuals in the organization is an ongoing problem because of the verbal abuse, misuse of one's time, energy and resources. Simply put, people get tired of being used.Mr. White give an excellent accounting of NOI business practices and its financial chaos and ruin. The average member in the NOI does not know of the financial mishaps and moreso, the ones that are responsible for such bad financial descision making.This is an excellent read for anyone who wants to join the NOI or who is seriously considering.I only wish this book was in print before I wasted many years inside that organization.Bravo Mr. White."},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"I've Read this book and to be honest the author did state that in his writing, \\"these are my own personal views\\"; in which are alot of assumptions. We must remember that, \\"even though the teachings are perfect human beings are not, this is why we strive to be perfect\\". I have to say that this is good reading for those whom are considering joining the Nation of Islam in order that you may know that the Nation of Islam is not a perfect utopia but is striving to be."},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"Dr. White writes an interesting expose on the current political and financial status of the Nation of Islam. However, he fails to make his argument on why Black Muslims should follow orthodox Islam and not the NOI's teachings. He does a good job of showing Farrakhan's supporters how the Minister may not be staying true to the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, but fails to throw any meaningful criticism at the teachings themselves. Yet this doesn't stop Dr. White from waiting until the end of his book to suggest to Muslims that they follow Orthodox Islam. A religion is not a horse race who's credibility is determined by the number of followers who \`bet' on it. So his argument that Black Muslims in America should practice and follow Orthodox Islam because this is what millions of other Muslims around the world are doing is not convincing. Orthodox Islam is filled with a lot of Arab culture and is therefore better suited for Arabs (I'm sure many Sunni Muslims disagree). But Black Muslims, and African Americans in general, still need a program that teaches them how to become spiritually, economically, politically, and socially empowered. Elijah Muhammad's program teaches this. Whether or not Farrakhan and today's NOI is teaching it remains to be seen and White's book does a good job showing this.For the record, saying that \`there is no God but Allah and Muhammad (PBUH) is his Messenger' (the Shahada) in one breath, and saying \`Allah appeared in the person of Master Fard Muhammad and Elijah is his Messenger' in another breath is NOT a contradiction. White should know this. With true enlightenment, Allah appears in all of us. He (Allah) can have more than one Messenger (not to be confused with \`Prophet'). Anyone who speaks the word of God is a Messenger as he is bringing God's message to the people. Hence, there is no contradiction in Farrakhan disseminating Elijah's teachings while taking his Shahada.His excerpts and interpretation of Farrakhan's statements and speeches could have easily been copied from the New York Times who has always been biased against Min. Farrakhan and the NOI. I strongly suggest that if one wishes to learn more about Farrakhan's thoughts on certain issues, they listen to the speeches themselves and NOT get their interpretation from Dr. White's book.White's poor editing also served as an intellectual turnoff. Earlier in the book, he talks about Khallid Muhammad's death while later envisioning him as a great leader in the future as if the man is still alive(???). In the same earlier chapter he mentions that Khallid received his doctorate from Xavier University (page 93) then turns around later (page 119) and questions his \`Doctor' title by noting how the alleged university that Khalid received his doctorate from, Dillard University, has no record of Khallid ever receiving his Doctorate )???).Nonetheless, White's book is useful information for the individual who considers joining or supporting the NOI without first questioning the organization's political and financial motives and practices."},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"If the author is correct then things in the NOI are not what they appear to be. Mr. White portrays th NOI as not so much a religion but a cult. His description of the FOI ( the military/security branch of the NOI) is particularly chilling."},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"I certainly have to say that this is an intriging and interesting book, but Dr. White has left some concerns that we as readers need to be careful of. For example, eventhough Dr. White has an upper hand of what goes on in both the general membership and the hierchy of the Nation of Islam, many of his views, beliefs and descriptions in the book have been flawed with anger and emotion. Due to this fact, he's doing nothing more than to continue to give Minister Farrakhan and other members and officials in the Nation injustice, eventhough some of the things that he said may have been true. When I saw that his book was forwarded by 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace, I knew that Dr. White's book on Minister Farrakhan and the Nation is biased because Mr. Wallace has been known for his bashing of the original Nation of Islam under the leadership of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad when he and African-American Journalist, Louis Lomax made a show in 1959 called &quot;The Hate That Hate Produced.&quot; Even some parts of both World Islamic History and Nation of Islam history are inaccurate. For example, Dr. White mentioned that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) came from the tribe of Shabazz. This is false. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) came from a prominent Arab tribe called the Qur'aish. The tribe of Shabazz was a name given by both Nation of Islam founder from the East, Master W.F. Muhammad and his successor, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad referring to African-Americans. Another thing that Dr. White didn't make clear was that he didn't specify that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad's son, Imam Wallace D. Mohammed became the leader of the Nation of Islam in 1975 after his Father's death. Furthermore, Imam Mohammed continued to lead the Nation of Islam until his resignation from his leadership in August of 2003. During his leadership, Imam led his followers to practice Islam based on the Holy Qur'an and the model character of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The Nation of Islam that Farrakhan leads was a new group that he formed in 1977. Farrakhan was a Minister and Imam (Muslim Minister) under Imam Mohammed for two and a half years, until he became dissatisfied with the changes that Imam Mohammed made when he became the leader. The original teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, which Minister Farrakhan's teachings are based on, dealt mainly with knowledge of self, some Muslim concepts and unIslamic beliefs such as the belief that Nation of Islam's founder, Master Fard Muhammad, is G'd. As Muslims we worship the Creator, not creation."},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"Overall, this is not a bad account, the only minor complaints are some inconsistencies (one section deals with Khallid Muhammad;s death and later in the book, White speculates on Khallid as a future NOI leader) and some historical errors here and there. That aside, White's description of the NOI (an organization which, as a believer in the brotherhood of humanity, I personally have little regard for), makes it clear that little has changed in this organization since Malcolm X (wisely) left it in the 1960s in regards to it's exploitation of angry, confused, and disfranchised Blacks. Some better editing would improve the book, but it's core lesson should be heeded to potential converts to groups like the NOI-\\"Those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\""},{"Title":"Inside the Nation of Islam: A Historical and Personal Testimony by a Black Muslim","review":"Only Mr. White knows the validity of his personal experiences inside the Nation of Islam. However, anytime I am troubled by something Minister Farrakhan allegedly said, I attempt to obtain the video of the actual speech. Copies of most speeches are available via the internet. Time and time again, the Minister has proven he is not the vicious racist the media claims him to be.Mr. White's book is full of the same half truths, one sided accounts, and statements taken out of context, which have been attributed to Minister Farrakhan for over 20 years.If you want to know what Mr. White claims Farrakhan said , buy this book. If you want to know what Farrakhan said, visit the Nation of Islam's website."},{"Title":"Nickerson's No-Risk Way to Real Estate Fortunes","review":"Nickerson presents a conservative, realistic scenario for starting small and steadliy building wealth.

The only redeeming quality is that it includes links to a couple well-known sites that do have a little bit of useful information (Chris Sells runs one site -- check a search engine).How would I know? I recently left the big M for another venture but I previously did lots of technical recruiting. I can't tell you what to do to get hired by MS and neither can this book for one very simple reason that unfortunately won't make the author or myself rich: THERE IS NO SECRET. If you're a) smart b) technically skilled and c) motivated to build cool stuff then you're probably in good shape. If you're not, all the books in the world won't help you.A typical example of why this book couldn't help you at all is because it doesn't include ANY of what we call &quot;technical questions.&quot; For the programmers out there, an example would be a specific question about the C++ language, or perhaps a question to design a class to do XYZ or describe a product design given a vague product category, or maybe implement some function given a description or design an algorithm. Every interviewer has a handful of these that they'll use often and you can't prepare for them. Memorizing an answer won't get you far because the questions morph as the candidate answers them or appears to have memorized them. :-)The book does attempt to describe the hiring philosophy of Microsoft. Too bad there is no single such philosophy per se. Everybody has their own opinions about how to identify good talent, and some people specialize in digging into certain areas with candidates in a sort of cooperative process to discover as much as possible in one day. Don't believe for a second that Bill Gates sat down one day and wrote a definitive guide on how to interview candidates and that this guide was printed by the thousands and drilled into everyone's brains. It just doesn't work this way.If you're not convinced yet, know this: the middle section of this book, 35 pages, is a complete list of every Microsoft business office the world over. Nevermind that nearly all technical product development positions are located in Redmond, WA, with a minority in the Bay area. And I'm sure the address information is on the Web in case you really need to submit your resume for a post in Portugal.If you still think this book is possibly worth reading through, I hope you'll cancel your interview schedule and save yourself and MS some time and money. Few serious candidates could read through this book and expect to get hired from the information -- the only way this book will get bought is through places like amazon where there's nothing but a picture and a glowing publisher summary -- you wouldn't touch it if you were in a bookstore.If you have money to buy a book, try something useful like Essential COM or Code Complete or Debugging the Development Process or one of Knuth's books or Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Lieserson (sp?), and Rivest.

I hate to see people profit off misinformation."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Getting a Job at Microsoft","review":"Take it from someone on the inside, this book is not going to help you.

Sure, if you're planning to apply for the job of personal assistant to Bill Gates or establish yourself as the imminent software guru who's going to develop the MS strategic thrust for 2005 -- then this book may be too basic. But, keeping in mind that MS employs lots and LOTS of people, the book is a true getting-started guide which can help someone honestly considering how to get a job at MS -- at multiple levels of the company. (Despite the &quot;Unofficial&quot; word in the book's title, Smith had to have had some critical sources who really KNOW how MS works).Moreover, there's a second reason why this book clicks. So many people admire the company and list it on their most-favored list (and invest in it!), that here's a whole new way to look at the company. By reading about how the employment game works at MS, one can perhaps glean how it is that the company competes and performs. Which makes the book valuable even if you're planning to continue working in automotives or clothing sales.For most people, Microsoft is now a monolith. Smith sought to unlock the basics of how MS hires people. In the main, she succeeds. (There's also a wealth of addresses and links for MS worldwide!)Will everyone who reads this book and applies for a job at MS get hired there? Probably not.

This book helps you to focus your job search better, or focus what you want to do for a particular company like Microsoft.And now as a hiring manager, I found the chapters on behavorial interviewing extremely useful. The tips showed me how to probe more effectively the skills my candidates are good at and how they use them; how they apply their ideas and how they think; and that it's okay to have weaknesses as long as they know what they are and how to manage them.If you are looking to interview, go on interviews or change the way your company thinks in interviewing, I would highly recommend you buy this book.

The Unofficial Guide to Getting a Job at Microsoft doesn't mince words. Nor is it filled with fluff. In its tight, concise 192 pages it opens the doors of Microsoft's hiring practices as no other book or reference ever has.All of the book's ten chapters and numerous appendices are significant, insightful and well documented. Readers will want to read and re-read the entire book. However, two chapters need reviewing over and over again: Preparing for Microsoft's Infamous Interviews and Typical Microsoft Interview Questions are chock full of heady, thought-provoking material culled from actual events and actual interviews at Microsoft.McGraw-Hill's editor's report states, \\"...the book looks at the strategies Microsoft employs to draw the best available people to the company and keep them there for the long term and what these [strategies] mean to the potential job seekers.\\" The greater benefit of The Unofficial Guide to Getting a Job at Microsoft is that it transcends the Microsoft workplace. While the book's focus is absolutely on Microsoft under Smith's microscopic eye, Rebecca Smith goes deeply into the process of the behavioral interview and how Microsoft recruiters use it. Since other companies are adopting this Microsoft hiring model on a daily basis, this book is a must read for anyone interested in working for a high tech - high energy, growth company. Smith's newest book is a true eye-opener. It contains new and highly relevant information and references. If you are looking for a Microsoft recruiter in Morocco, Slovenia or Denmark you'll find the email address and complete contact information in this book.

This book is a vivid example of the hatred ardent conservatives are spewing on all wavelengths. Ardent liberals are not better, and \\"we, the people\\" are the victims.This book IS NOT worth reading if one wants to know the truth; it IS WORTH reading if one is ready to fight.I have been unsuccessfully trying to fight in my book \\"This Unbearable Boredom of Being: A Crisis of Meaning in America,\\" which is available through Amazon, but because it has not been published by a commercial publisher , it is thus virtually unknown and unread.One of the problems I discuss there is the problem of the dismal state of our child-care.

However, in today's America mothers CANNOT AFFORD staying home - either for financial reasons or because, as human beings, they want to develop themselves (we call that \\"career,\\" which is wrong!). And we must not fool ourselves: even when mothers are at home that is the TV and video games that are \\"forming\\" their children's personalities. In most cases mothers simply CANNOT give much to their children, because they themselves do not have much to give. This is, in turn, because of the dismal state of our education that has degenerated into \\"training\\" and \\"teaching skills,\\" rather than giving knowledge and building spiritual core in a child - see my book. And of course, according to Ms. O'Beirne, \\"feminism\\" is to blame for every attempt of a woman to seek better care and education for her children, and her desire to be more than \\"just mother.\\" This is, without saying, wrong, although intransigent feminism is not better than intransigent conservatism or liberalism.That's where we stand!

Tells it just the way it is. Highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Since the nineteenth century, a certain philosophy has believed that there is nothing innate in human nature; that humans are merely social constructs. The notion is that if society is changed, that human nature will change to reflect that society. So, a perfect society will build perfect people. Yeah, I know it is ridiculous, but a whole group of academic, legal, and political types still believe it and are working hard to remake you and me and especially our children into their desired worldview. The problem is that they are inverting the values most of us believe in and are subverting the society we care about.Kate O'Beirne has provided eight insightful essays on various aspects of this problem. And while O'Beirne is no bomb thrower, I found myself becoming exasperated with the arrogance and moral vacuity of those she documents in each essay. In the first chapter she discusses how radical feminism has weakened the family. Most people still believe the family is vitally important and that much that has gone wrong in our families over the past half century has been enhanced by the decadence that has grown in our society. For far too many people, their desire (need) for self-actualization (read narcissism) has become the altar upon which devotion, commitment, and children must be sacrificed.The second chapter on the agenda around daycare versus homecare of children sends chills up my spine. There are academics who actively teach a child is worse off with a strong attachment to his or her mother and call it \\"Exclusive Attachment Syndrome\\" (EAS) as a disorder to be treated! Yes, there is a level of sole fixation that is a disorder, but that isn't what is being discussed in the information quoted here by O'Beirne. These advocates are justifying leaving much of the raising of their children to others with weak rationalizations and by attacking those who make the more traditional choice of personally raising their children and the personal sacrifices that entails. Make sure your blood pressure is under control when you read this chapter.The third chapter is a very reasonable discussion around the claims of wage disparity between men and women and what the data actually show. Of course men and women should get the same pay for the same work, but that isn't what the propaganda claiming hardship for women actually compares. The author is quite careful and clear about what is being claimed and what is really happening in the workplace. Good stuff.The fourth and fifth chapters take on the agenda of favoring girls over boys in our current classrooms and the way competitive sports are configured in our colleges. Having raised three boys and three girls, I can confirm that boys have a hard time nowadays and the schools are very quick to pull the trigger on wanting them medicated. The abuse of Title IX by certain lobbies is sickening. It was never meant to kill mens track & field and wrestling, but that is essentially what it is doing in too many schools. For one, I am thrilled to see more women participating in sports and admire what they do, but the abuse of the code to hammer men's sports is just wrong.Chapter six takes on women in the military. It is a small but dedicated lobby that wants women in combat (not for themselves, but to advance their own various agendas). Talk about being out of the mainstream of the values of the American people! This is an idiotic and miserable idea that I am still bewildered by. Chapter seven demonstrates that the so called Gender Gap the Republicans suffer with women is a myth. In fact, the Democrats suffer much more of a Gender Gap with men. Of course, the media don't mention that much. Chapter eight takes on the ridiculous lengths some take the abortion debate, to the point of lying about partial birth abortion and keeping that barbarity legal against the will of the American people.O'Beirne concludes with a fine essay discussing the doctrine of social creation of human personality (the left doctrine) versus the reality of innate human nature (which is borne out be experience and research). It is amazing to me that research of various kinds that are showing results that conflict with certain left doctrines are not only being suppressed, loud voices are trying to keep the work from being done. And when results are discussed in the media other voices cry foul. This is not only wrong, it is sad.I am afraid that Kate O'Beirne will suffer many personal attacks because of this book. Her opponents will simply try to shout her down because they are unable to debate her careful research and clear thinking. Of course, you should read this book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This book is smashing stereotypes and myths that have poisoned our lives for decades.

Well documented but not intended to be a scholarly effort, more a friendly book that is trying to make a point. With that in mind it was a strong success.[...] This author does not pull punches and it seems that the feminists are not accustomed to open debate and being challanged. And so it goes. Take [...] What you see is [...] just more evidence that O'Beirne has really hit a nerve.The book is broken into chapters by topic. These include such areas as daycare, the military, sports and title IX, abortion, and others. O'Beirne excels in taking each topic and telling the story about that particular niche. She includes the history and importantly offers quotes from feminists of the time. The more you read the more you see that the quotes expose these people as having at least a moderate degree of pathological narcissism. Time after time their recommendations are only in service to themselves. The book has a cumulative effect so that by the end one is getting a strong sense that these folks are seeing the world from a very limited perspective. For those of us who have succesfully parented young children into adulthood we are painfully aware that in order to succeed one must sacrifice ones own needs to be of service to the child. We don't hear a thing about that sort of thing from the feminists. It's all about them.Another area O'Beirne touched on was the similar histories of the leading feminists. Most had very difficult and sometimes traumatic childhoods and the obvious question remains: Are they acting out their own histories onto the general public? Many of these women have never had children and surely not male children yet they are offering abundant advice to actual mothers. They go so far as telling these mothers that their presence is not really that important to their children! LOL!! The lengths they go to propagate their agenda is truly amazing.This book will give you a sense of what feminism has become and how far adrift it has veered from its original concept of equality. At this point it is clear that feminism is basically about \\"more stuff for women and girls\\" and less about trueequality. This is coming close to bigotry. O'Beirne's book gives you a sense of just how close they have come. You be the judge."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"[...] If you are unable to think for yourself, you will be unable to read material objectively and accept its outcome regardless of whether or not you wanted that outcome. Ms. O'Beirne's book takes on the consequences of modern feminism in a hard-hitting manner. Feminism is not what most people think it is: It is not simply a call for women's rights. It used to be. This is what we refer to as first-wave feminism, which was concerned primarily with the female vote, workplace equality, and making sure that women could freely choose the course of their own lives. Second-wave feminism, however,came much later. Its focus is abortion and day care, although these are not inherent rights; they are complicated social issues that require deep examination. That's where Ms. O'Beirne's book comes in. (Third-wave feminism, by the way, is in its beginning stages and is still searching for a purpose.)WWMTWW simply looks at the other side of second-wave feminism, the side few people know about because the media is comprised almost exclusively of feminists or feminists' co-workers, relatives, or spouses. So if you are looking for an in-depth analysis of feminism and its effects on our society, buy WWMTWW. If, however, you are looking to validate your choices, lifestyle, or political leanings, don't actually read the book.

We have become a \\"two income necessary\\" society only because we have allowed it to happen. It's great that there are women in the workforce, but the women's lib movement really seemed to think that this was the only way in which women should participate in society and sadly sadly overlooked how necessary and essential motherhood is. The authoress (I'm sure just using this term has already bristled the hair of a femi-nazi somewhere reading this) quite nobly defends motherhood and its utmost and paramount importance to our life as a culture and society. Thankfully, most of my generation (especially the females) has seen the damage done by these over-zealous few that have made growing up for so many children very difficult.

But, the content of this book is first-rate and O'Beirne did a really god job researching her material and carefully citing which feminist said or wrote what and how they are mainstream and powerful within our culture and not on the 'fringe' of feminism. She also carefully identifies the main issues impacting the culture and the lives of people.O'Beirne also cites some other good anti-feminist works and I've read all of them and I agree they are well worth studying.I am pleased to see that there are quite a few women today - many of them EX-feminist - who have come to see what a crock feminism is and to see it's evil effects on marriage, the family, children, men, women, and on culture and society. I used to think that most women would just not speak up about it, but many have - although it has taken them a while to get around to it.A feminist woman I know, saw me reading the book and she immediately started attacking it. All of her objections were wrong and I corrected each false assumption she made. She wound up fuming and stomped off.

Well if I was a woman, looking for insights on how femminism damaged the society, well I would have given 5 stars.But I'm a man, and after reading, and appreciating it overall, I realized something. The book addresses basically why a culture of hatred against males is basically worhtless, does not make the society a better one ... so what? I mean... if hatred of males was productive, it may be justified?Basically men are a tool, confirming a clear paradigm, well established in the mind of the writer, that man must be worth to justify its (its is not a mistake) necessity, and it does not deserve dignity of being considered human.Hatred of males is not necessarely bad, it's just that it damages the marriage istitution (as it is perceived by a woman) and possibly the kids (daughters need fathers, and sons without father may become criminal, maybe rapers, or simply bad fathers).Well after all it is my fault, the cover says everything \\"...Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports\\" not men."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I'm sure no intelligent reader of the reviews of this book will regard any of the single-star reviews posted by those gender Mujahadeen who responded so faithfully to the call of their Ayatollah to wage Holy Jihad against one of the most positive literary contributions to the achievement of freedom and true equality in recent years. Their single star votes may have helped decrease this book's ratings, but to all those out there who've actually read it, they've all just revealed their collective idiocy, clearly not even having opened the book they attack with such religious fervour. All it required was a little encouragement from a representative of America's gender Taliban, and the Mujahadeen were available in droves in their efforts to suppress freedom and true equality in their typical fashion.However, that is the usual behaviour of those opposing people like Kate O'Beirne, and they give all sensible people one more reason to oppose their attempts to block constructive criticism. This book is a fantastic objective analysis of what has become one of western democracy's most pernicious movements, a she-wolf in sheep's clothing which is helping ruin the lives of hundreds of millions of normal men and women with it's blundering ignorance and arrogance. Hats off to Kate O'Beirne for risking all to help spread the truth behind this pseudo-progressive movement, such a sorry remnant of history's once-proud women's movement, which achieved so much for all men and women. Modern Taliban Feminism spits in the faces of those brave women, and it is imperative that all interested in a positive future for humanity join forces with Kate and, with the aid of knowledge, wisdom and understanding, help to beat down one of the most disturbing forces currently afflicting Western society, one which is ruining our society in the name of doing good.

It is a pretty basic recitation of specific quotes and actions taken by women that Ms. O'Beirne uses as examples. Of course, there is also opinion, but that is easily separated from the facts, which for the most part speak for themselves. I guess opinion is sacred when it comes from the Dixie Chicks, but profane from any other viewpoint. The material in this book is good, and is worthwhile reading, but Ms. O'Beirne's style is a bit reserved for me, hence the four star rating instead of five.

Yesterday it was #51. Today it is #78, solely because people from this site, from Crooks & Liars, from Kos (thanks Rena) and Jesus' General acted in concert for political action.\\"Wow. Imagine being proud of a mass trashing of a book you never read and have no intention of reading, just because you don't like the author's politics. O'Beirne is an excellent writer, mostly for National Review for whom I believe she still works. It's obvious the book must be very good, indeed, to necessitate so many lefties waking up before noon to post illiterate hate blurbs.How typical of the free speech-hating left. And how sad, in a country with a 5 percent unemployment rate, none of these dopes could even qualify for hamburger flipping job."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"As I read the book I couldn't help but think, why the anger?

Kate O'Beirne's analysis is honest and thorough. She rejects the victimization of women upon which the feminist base their demands and points out the needlessly destructive effects of the way Title IV has been interpreted. There is much more in this book, as well, that points out the disservice to the lives of both men and women in America (and beyond) that this movement has brought about."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Kate O'Beirne provides an excellent review of gender feminist's attempts to demasculinize work and school environments and to weaken traditional families. Kate's analysis complements that of feminist critics such as Camille Anna Paglia who essentially make the same arguments from the left of the political spectrum. Her analysis of current sexual harassment law is particularly interesting. Gender feminists have been allowed to create a hostile environment in the workplace where coworkers are afraid to engage in normal, innocent human interactions. As Ms. Paglia has stated: \\"...I believe in moderate sexual harassment guidelines. But you can't have the Stalinist situation we have in America right now, where any neurotic woman can make any stupid charge and destroy a man's reputation. If there is evidence of false accusation, the accuser should be expelled. Similarly, a woman who falsely accuses a man of rape should be sent to jail. My definition of sexual harassment is specific. It is only sexual harassment--by a man or a woman--if it is quid pro quo. That is, if someone says, \\"You must do this or I'm going to do that\\"--for instance, fire you. And whereas touching is sexual harassment, speech is not. I am militant on this. Words must remain free. The solution to speech is that women must signal the level of their tolerance--women are all different. Some are very bawdy.\\""},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"What a breath of fresh air!!This book is especially brilliant as it shows that not all woman have been poisoned by feminism and that there are a few with their logical faculties still intact.What a brave and couragious woman - my respect to you.One other thing - I bet my life that all those who give this book one star have not even read it!!!!That fact alone tells me all I need to know"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This is a very interesting book.

Truth be told, it is actually individuals who write books like these who are \\"making the world worse.\\" Please, do not even bother to misinform, frustrate, or baffle yourself with this [...].

Katie writes a humorous tome about how feminists are to blame for everything, yes even ruining sports! You may be confused into thinking at first this was a serious piece of writing, but let me assure you, this is a genius work of irony. Katie's amusing rhetoric would do far more to make the world a worse place than any feminist I've encountered, if you could actually take it seriously.Some of the highlights for me was how Kate represented all feminists as being the same as each other with the same ideas, all radical (i.e. crazy!). For example, I loved how Kate reported that feminists believe that women's fertility makes women inherently inferior to men. The contradiction of Kate portraying a radical feminist as believing that women are inferior to men was just delightful to me!Overall - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

In light of this trashy piece of pop social science, I can think of one woman who is definitely contributing to making the world worse, and that is Ms. O'Beirne herself - if not only by her paleolithic views, but also by her lack of serious scholarship, and her attitude that \\"anything goes\\" in order to make a political point.In Ms. O'Beirne's world, any woman who doesn't inhabit the twilight zone of rightwing fringe politics is ripe for her ludicrous attacks.

Is there anyone out there who commented favorably on this book who even thinks for a moment that Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, Phyllis Schafly or Anne Coulter would become targets for the authors barbs? Not if they are honest. (Liberal) Women Who Make the World Worse would have been a more truthful title. But that begs the question, is it ONLY \\"liberal\\" women who make the world worse? Are there no conservative women who make the world worse? Had Ms. O'Beirne been interested in writing a book about women, ALL WOMEN, she would have aimed her pen not just at \\"liberals\\".

She may (or may not be right) - but I know that there about an equal number of sources saying the opposite - this discrepancy is neither addressed nor resolved.Gender quotas for college athletes have created the unintended consequence (per Sen. Bayh, one of the law's authors) of eliminating thousands of slots for male athletes on intercollegiate teams over the past 15 years - not simply boosting female participation. Despite surveys and indicators such as sex participation within Little League (almost all boys) vs. softball (almost all girls), voluntary participation in intra-mural etc. athletics in college, the feminists persist in bringing men down to their level. Score one for Beirne.O'Beirne then comments on the hyping of women supposedly in combat - eg. Jessica Lynch never fired a shot), and points out that studies show the top 5% of women in aerobic capacity have only the ability of the median male. Other physical limitations are also important - eg. the Navy's job of stretcher-bearer requires two men (100% could do), but only 12% of females could - thus, the job was redefined to require four persons. Then there is the problem of women not being able to carry as much combat equipment as men (up to 150 pounds) or gear as firemen. Score another for Beirne.However, she does not go into women's capabilities as pilots - others have, and the results are depressing!Finally, O'Beirne goes off onto the abortion issue - the usual back and forth comments.Less than enthralling."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"but if you want respect for it, you need to be willing to respect the opinions of others as well.

Good Luck at finding your perfect Stepford Wife.But I happen to like living in a world in which I was free to get a great education, buy my own home, earn a good salary, and live my life as I choose with no options stripped from me because of my gender.

Are they so willfully blind, or are they simply pandering to an audience? And if the latter, what's the use in preaching to the choir? That's what Kate O'Beirne is doing in Women Who Make the World Worse.It's especially frustrating here, because half of this book would have made an excellent piece of moderate political reporting. O'Beirne, when she's focusing on radical feminists, does a relatively good common-sense job of shooting their arguments down, showing their lack of statistical knowledge, and the mechanisms they've used for the past few decades to turn the raving of a small, vocal minority into United States legislation.The problem with this book comes when O'Beirne fails to realize that sometimes it's not enough to simply break things. You don't always need a blueprint on how to rebuild them; people will rebuild on their own. O'Beirne's blueprint, as one would (with great reservations, I hope) expect, is just as radical, but coming from the current definition of the right. If you're going to break down extremism, could anything be more offensive than replacing it with nothing but a different extremism? O'Beirne sees the world in black and white, when the issues she's discussing are obviously cloaked in shades of grey. She could take some lessons from the leaders of a group she refers to with great admiration, Feminists for Life.Recommended for the first half of each chapter; remember, however, when reading the latter half of each chapter that the most practical solution often lies between two extremes. **"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Kate O'Beirne has finally done what so many of us have wanted to do.

For instance, how could anyone argue with her assertion that feminists exploit female war casualties to \\"advance the feminist agenda of androgyny and abortion.\\" Even I have to admit that every time I hear that another woman has been sacrificed in our glorious Iraq adventure, I'm tempted to tell my wife, Ofjoshua, to throw on a pair of jeans, head for the nearest women's health clinic, and help them slaughter a whole passel of blastocyst-Americans.But I think it's her frequent attacks against the television show, \\"Sex in the City,\\" that I value most about this book. By promoting the myth that women should enjoy sex, that show has done more to destroy the institution of marriage than even homosexual unions. I think most men will agree with me when I say that there isn't a woman alive who isn't thoroughly repulsed by sex. Telling them that it should be a pleasant experience rather than a vomit-inducing one only serves to cause them to resent their husbands when the impossible isn't delivered. Hopefully, this book will help destroy that myth.As much as I enjoyed this book, I can't give it more than a single star because it has a fatal flaw. It promotes the most destructive myth of all, the existence of lesbianism. Mrs. O'Beirne discusses it throughout the book as if it is something that is real.

Bush's America.(...)"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"There is no doubt that we have been subject to many Women Who Make the World Worse in recent years, and Kate O'Beirne explains why with sharp wit and cutting terms. While clearly making her case against women in combat, the author herself takes a machine gun to the work of feminists, and in chapter after chapter demolishes the integrity and mission of angry activists who have attacked western culture as a patriarchal plot to oppress women. Using a parade of statistics, anecdotes, and strategies gone amuck, she has ample intellectual ammunition to shred the sisterhood which has worked so hard for decades to shred society.Most of the ironies she points out are lost on these women, who want men to suppress any chivalrous instincts or protectiveness towards their fellow female soldiers in the field but to undergo sensitivity training about women's feelings in all other realms of life. They have proclaimed \\"choice\\" a sacred right, and yet do a constant end run around women's choice if is not used to further the feminists' own cause. In a humorous vein, women want to be taken seriously in the quest for equality and intellectual competitiveness, and yet they swoon, pout, or rage like adolescent school girls at any comments they find offensive or untenable. Less funny is the constant provocation of men, through male-bashing and reverse discrimination, which combine to create resentment and bitterness between the sexes in nearly every arena of daily life.Women in the first half of the 20th century spent a great deal of energy working to enhance the moral fiber of their men, through prohibition, by encouraging all women to remain virtuous and chaste as a brake for promiscuity, to dedicated themselves to strong families, and by raising their sons to aspire to be gentlemen. What frustration there was at a double-standard for chastity was evidently thrown out the window when these women discovered that motherhood was their ball and chain, and they decided that, with ample access to birth control and abortion, they could be as naughty as the worst of the men and abandon the children to drift with the popular culture.She quotes Mary Ann Glendon's comments of the difference between the early feminists, who knew that \\"the ready availability of abortion would facilitate the sexual exploitation of women,\\" and those who followed in the 1970's, who were, she says, \\"a puzzling combination of two things that do not ordinarily go together: anger against men and promiscuity; man-hating and man-chasing\\" (p. 161).After years of feminists battles in politics, the military, and the academy, women can now claim great strides \\"forward,\\" including promiscuity in record levels, burgeoning STD's, fully one-third of children being raised without the guidance of their fathers, increased combat-related casualties for women, 40 million abortions, vulgarity at all hours on the airwaves, and rampant depression and psychoses. And yet, they insist, there is much more to be done. God help us!Kate is to be commended for making her case so clearly. Categorically, she explains how women in combat, women's studies programs, no-fault divorce laws, Title IX, and demands for parity in the workplace are coercive, damaging, and based on lies. The enemy is clearly outlined in terms of strategy and end games, but I had a sense that two things were missing. First, the bizarre motivation was not investigated, and secondly, the effects of the negatively transformed culture to which we are heirs is not adequately considered.There is brief mention in the introduction of the dysfunctional backgrounds of a few feminists, such as Jane Fonda, Germaine Greer, and Betty Freidan, but the topic is not pursued. While parodying these women is simple, I think a better (more motherly) approach would have been to explain the pain that drives these women. Without giving in to their agenda, showing how the \\"personal\\" details of a group of women became the \\"political\\" for the masses would have been more fruitful.The second reservation is more important, because Kate makes her case about the choices of the next generation - who are rejecting the full-monty of the feminist dream. Instead, she points out that they are choosing education without the help of government programs, motherhood despite the difficulty of finding men who will commit, and balance in order to keep their lives from fraying at the edges. \\"See,\\" the author seems to say, \\"women don't need feminism; they're doing just fine.\\" I don't buy it.Whereas the feminist agenda is wrong on almost every point, these women were reacting against something that was oppressive, stifling, and defective itself. We rejoice in many of the choices we have in education, work, and family decisions, but we have to admit that these were not available in 1955. The angry spark lit by the few certainly grew out of control through a positive response on a popular level - which was effectively studied in Caroline Graglia's Domestic Tranquility. (Only by reading these books together will the feminist movement be understood.)Finally, in commending the new generation for choosing to have more balanced lives, she seems to ignore her own statistic revealing rampant fatherlessness, politicized school curricula, and a depraved and intrusive youth culture. Do these matter or don't they? How did common sense prevail when feminists stacked the deck against it in the next generation. Perhaps the human soul is hardier than we think, or the prayers of many stalwart souls have won out over dangerous social experiments. Regardless, it was a question which hung in this reviewer's mind as she pored over so much triumphalist data, proving that feminists are out-dated, mixed-up, and un-hinged. Would that Kate is right, but I don't think the bulk of the healing is even close to being done.feminine-genius.typepad.com"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This book doesn't break any new ground; it merely presents more of the usual drivel. It's content was thin and padded with the usual made up anecdotes beloved of the self-help genre.I'm a woman who worked first as a defense industry engineer and then became a physician. In both of my careers I have met a few women who, like Ms O'Beirne, say that they aren't feminists, but who, like Ms O'Beirne, take advantage of all of the choices that feminism has made possible for them. If Ms O'Beirne were true to her beliefs she would not have made a career as editor and writer, but would have remained at home caring for her house and family. The basic premise of this book would be much more understandable had the book been written by a man rather than by a professional woman."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"what more do you have to say.

If my sons were calling somebody else's name at night and sobbing I would feel ashamed, this lady was confused and her psychologist's reaction was \\"interesting\\".In terms of the rest of the book I found it quite readable although there wasn't much in it that I was unaware of, with the exception of some of the books by people she Lionizes. I would have to disagree on a single point concerning Chapter 6. Any person man or woman joining the armed services should understand the risks thereof. I see no compelling reason to exclude women from combat on the understanding that the women involved A: Meet the same physical/training standards as men and B: Accept those risks without question. Personally I would feel a lot better about sending my sons into combat than my nieces, but as adults if they wish to take the risk and serve more power to them.The best point she seems to make is that Feminist movement is both a gravy train and a ponzi scheme. The major (and quite correct) goals of the vote, equal pay and equality under the law have already been long achieved. Rather than declaring the victory so hard won a state of perpetual crisis is declared; after all you don't get government grants or corporate payola for victory, this type of money is generated only if the crisis still exists.For myself it sounds more like a religion, the reactions described in the book over and over are the words: \\"but it would hurt the cause.\\" Any cause that is hurt by facts and truth deserves to be hurt.This book should generate some interesting back and forth. I look forward to it."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I have long believed that the glass ceiling created by women was real for a time but now is merely a myth. Truth is women already rule the world. They just do not have the guts to admitt it. And yes they have made just as big a mess of it as men ever did. I am aware that this truth will get me no support whatsoever in the helpful column, but still it is true.Go to any school, and bank, any super-market, any coorporate office, credit union or resturant, any airport, train station, casino...anywhere...and look around and you will find the vast majority of employees are women. And that includes positions from the bottom to the top. But just like the other special interest manipultors in our society they can never admit they have won or their purpose goes away. Remember you must be a victim for all time or you are nothing!The fact is that hard core feminist women's groups will not be satisfied until a women is in every executive position in the entire world, actually they just want every position everywhere and the men should stay at home, in the kitchen and ready for stud service when called upon. That is the only truth that one needs to accept about fanatical female special interest groups.Look at the news and commercials and movies and everywhere you look the majority of participants are women. Hey, it is just a fact of life that women are running things from the ground up and will soon be doing the same from the White House...if they are not already doing so.So I say again, they have bungled the world just as badly as the guys did when they had control years agao and are making things worse each and every day.I ordered this book hoping to find that a female author who would actually tell the truth and displayed in writting, mostly because I had watched Kate on a few TV shows and thought she did well there and might provide an intuitive insight.I expected to find something as well organized, logical and enlightended about the females who make the world a dark place as I found in the \\"Marketing of Evil\\" book by David Kupelian and the \\"Do as I Say, Not as I Do\\" book by Peter Schweizer or the Ann Couter books which are witty and factual and honest beyond compare.Boy was I disappointed. I'll tell you the nagging question that kept popping up in my mind, \\"Is she supporting or denouncing this womans views?\\"...I could not tell. There would be five paragraphs repeating someones stance then two or three sentences of someone else said this. It wasn't clear if she was pro or con.Kate O'Beirne whom I hoped would give me an informative look at various corrupted and illogical women (like Ruth Ginsberg, Jane Fonda, Hillary Clinton, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein and a host of others...(and oh that congresswoman who likes to attack capitol police and ramble on about stupid stuff afterwards...due to being corrupted by her perception of unlimited power...when questioned about it). But each chapter put me to sleep during the first few pages. There seemed to be so much spouting of specious non-senscial quote after quote from people...no one on earth ever heard of.I had to cut through the nonsense and pick out the few important facts and information (which I admit was interwoven in there) in order to find meaningful material from this book.I truly could not read two pages during the first few chapters without getting completely bored and sleepy because there was nothing there of interest or meaning.This book, or the advisors who were consulted about its makeup must have had a secret plan to make this book totally irrelavent and unreadible to average Americans because it completely turned me off. Only through an innate desire to stick with it did I glean any meaningful information and it was sad that it wasn't better presented.Maybe it was just the arrogance of the authors and producers (which happens to so many influencial people when they become socially removed from their readers...just like congressional represenatatives) part that readers would or could follow the beginning incoherent diatrabe about what every elitist woman in the world things or has said.The grass roots people of this country wanted something more organized, directional and relavent to us and the basic trouble society as a whole is in facing today from both women and men in powerful and influencial places.This bouncing around from \\"she said this\\" to this other female \\"said this\\" to this other \\"said this\\" about subjects that meant nothing to most of us was jsut...borrrring....Poorly written, poorly organized, poorly presented and typical of why the reviewers on the cover said little of the substance within. They were probably bored into mediocrity when they wrote their review.If this is her idea of placing important women's failures before the American People, she did it very poorly and needs to take a hint from Ann Coulter and add more flare and wit to her commentaries."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"The author reveals her deficiencies by attacking the women who have made her own success in this society possible.

This is not opinion, although some women who have recently reviewed the book seem to think a woman being sexist is a matter of opinion. The book is well written and backed up by facts, any of which people can look into themselves with the books references.Kate has a right to her opinion on the facts and motives as to why the women in her book feel justified in their discrimination of men. At least one reviewer seems to think only feminists are entitled to opinion and free thought.Perhaps these later reviewers are not aware of the mass attempt to bring down the book by blindly posting negative reviews and recommending en masse those that best silence anyone who dare question any woman who makes the world worse. Feminist websites have organized this tactic very well.Only someone who is nowhere near the middle ground could claim that the women analyzed in this book deserve respect for what they have done. Men deserve equality too, although I'm not sure what some women think equality is anymore.It's your choice to read the book, which I enjoyed as a breath of fresh air against the usual rhetoric. If you enjoy statistics being twisted for a sinister, misandrist motive, you should visit the NOW website. This book has received so many negative reviews because so many women feel that their gender is simply incapable of being sexist.Thank you Kate."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"After reading this book you won't learn anything about feminists or any of the women mentioned in the book. You will learn a great deal about Kate O'Beirne. The portrait of her emerging from this book is not pretty. This woman has a truly ugly soul. She is filled with fear and loathing.Another thing; her obsession with Sex and the City as well as lesbianism is telling. Kate O'Beirne has some serious \\"issues\\".It is not feminists who are destroying the US military. It is the Bush administration. He has weakened our military to the point of putting troops in harms way without body armour. What is the point of mentioning facts though? O'Beirne is not interested in facts.

Of course, the real people \\"Screwing Up America\\" and \\"Mak[ing] the World Worse\\" are the people who make lists of others they feel are doing so. Three cheers for irony.What I find disturbing is that this is a woman arguing that women should be subservient to men, and that every advancement that's come about to further sexual equality is somehow an atrocity. This unnamed cousin to Stockholm Syndrome seems to run rampant among the women of the current brand of conservatives in the Republican party. Imagine a slave in the 1800s begging for heavier shackles.I guess the most repugnant thing about this book, though, is that she attacks feminism while at the same time benefiting from it at, what, [...]?

They criticize Kate for positions she doesn't hold and things she didn't even say! Are we reading the same book?Kate is NOT saying that women should be servile or that we should go \\"back to the '50's.\\" She clearly respects the early legacy of the women's movement (i.e. the sufragettes) and recognizes the talents and abilities of today's women. Kate is NOT saying that all mothers should stay at home and that day care is evil incarnate. She's simply not buying the feminist argument that day care is \\"better\\" than stay-at-home care. Further, she makes the case that many women would prefer to stay at home and that public policy makers should take this into account. She's NOT saying women shouldn't play sports. She's NOT saying women shouldn't study math and science. She's saying that we should stop spending time, effort, and money to try to force a 50/50 ratio in these areas.She points out something that many feminists and social scientist don't get... that, (surprise surprise) men and women are different!She points out the feminists' hypocrisy. I remember watching the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings when I was in junior high. All the uproar about Anita Hill. Then, president Clinton gets accused by multiple women and what do the feminists say? Nothing.I'm 31, a gen x-er, and think that Gloria Steinem and crew went too far. I clearly concur with Kate that when groups like NOW claim to be speaking for women, they are not speaking for me.The only part of the book I thought was weak was the section on the VAWA act. Yes, maybe the legislation contains some pork. However, domestic violence is a complex issue that needs a different approach than stranger crimes.Overall, this book is well worth the read.

The hateful veil of 'toxic male / pure and wronged female' fantasy that has been allowed to smother every aspect of human life throughout most western cultures for nearly half a century is becoming increasingly transparent to a large and growing number of people. Men and women. This book advances that vital process.Feminism is evil and wrong and as such is destined to be defeated by the passage of time alone. History has repeatedly demonstrated that any quasi-religious creed that has attempted to deny and redefine the essence of humanity is doomed from the outset. And those creeds that allow extremism and hatred to become their primary gospel often end up creating and realising the very antithesis of the unrealisable dreams that the multitudes of people, who are its disturbed and brainwashed disciples, have been fooled into believing in. Books like \\"Women Who Make the World Worse\\" help speed up that process of inevitable defeat. Thus contributing both to limiting the amount of damage caused and lessening the often savage momentum of the pendulum of pain, conscience and anger as it swings back from the lofty roost of extremism.Living in the United Kingdom I received the book three days ago. It is not a literary masterpiece, but it is fascinating and, most importantly, it is an icon of timeless, objective truth.

I really think everyone from Kate to Anne Coulter to Mick Savage to Sean has just gone to this well once too often, and frankly sometimes I think they're only doing it for my money.

Most of the topics and arguments that were covered I had heard in other places, but I am a bit of an informaiton junkie, so there was not a lot of knock me over parts of the book. In almost every chapter there were buttressing facts that I hadn't heard to arguments that I had. I am not sure for the purpose of conveying an argument the level of buttressing fact necesarily advanced the goal of the book. In a number of cases the flow of the argument felt choppy due to the bringing in additional buttressing facts. I would view this book as a good reference for anyone who is going to go into a debate about the topic but I am not sure that it will convince those who are not already leaning in the direction that Radical Feminism is outside of the mainstream and does more harm than good.What I saw as the glaring omission in the book was a discussion of why the Radical Feminists are advancing the positions that the are advancing. Reading through but book the main motivating factor seems to be that as long as people believe thier positions they will get money from the government. That may explain some of the less ethical memebers of the radical feminists movement but I believe that there are people who take misguided policy positions for misguided reasons. Kate O'Beirne does little to address the motivations of the sincere women and suggest alternate solutios that do not make the world worse.Despite this omission I think that this is a well researched and strongly argued book that is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"How pathetic the reviews of this book are!

Sadly, the book is replete with her failure to do so, but at least with the help of an editor it appears that she can -- so I'm going to give her a bonus star for almost making an effort.I read the book and I believe its premise is that pretty much anyone that disagrees with Kate O'Beirne is a feminist, even though those same feminists are the ones that allow a person like Kate O'Beirne to make a living writing books that describe how much Kate O'Beirne disagrees with them. I wish her better luck next time developing this continuing theme with her forthcoming work, \\"Why Liberal Women have Bad Teeth and an Atrocious Overbite\\".In summary, I can recommend this book highly.

This is an excellent primer for those still unfamiliar with the destructive hell that has been unleashed by radical feminism for the last 30+ years. Still, the book is badly titled as it includes praise of several women like Christina Hoff Sommers (The War Against Boys, Who Stole Feminism?). Oddly, there is nothing about Rosie O'Donnell. And why is Sarah Jessica Parker on the cover, as if her character had any real impact on anyone? The title and cover art must have been chosen by the publisher to create general hysteria. Obviously, it worked!!!This stuff has all been said before, but the more the word gets out the better. The book's only flaw is that it minimally represents the male viewpoint on issues of gender. I'd suggest going back and reading Warren Farrell's groundbreaking classic, \\"The Myth of Male Power\\" to fill in the gaps. Another book that documents how feminism has driven a wedge between the genders is \\"The Rantings of a Single Male\\" by Thomas Ellis, which is radical in both it's approach and style. Don't let that title throw you either, it's more witty than angry.

In Williamsville, N.Y. a 6-year-old boy kissed a girl on the cheek, after she asked him to, and was charged with sexual harassment. The boy was more upset for being banned from \\"coloring time\\" with his friends, and not being allowed to participate in his ice cream party for his good attendance.In Canton, Ohio, a 6-year-old boy with ADHD had to go to the doctor on the day of his class field trip, so his mom put him in the tub so he wouldn't see the school bus. When he heard the bus and ran to the window to tell them to wait, not only was the little boy suspended for sexual harassment, he was told by school officials to sign a paper stating that he understood the charges against him.In El Paso, Texas, a boy stuck his tongue out at a girl during a play-ground dispute and was charged.The sad thing is that these boys don't understand the severity of what has happened. A California boy was told by a friend that he wasn't allowed to attend his birthday party because of a similar incident. When these boys apply for college, they'll find a \\"sexual harassment charge\\" on their permanent school record.Title IX's unfortunate side effect has created this atmosphere that it's okay to target and label boys as young as 6 years old as sexual predators by adults who are lacking in experience, knowledge, or plain common sense.Title IX was written to ensure equal rights for both men and women, but is primarily used to eliminate athletic opportunity for college men. The law never seemed to apply whenever gender-inequities favored women, and this precedent has made it to the elementary school level where girls are just as, if not more, physically expressive as boys. But nationwide, only boys have been charged for sexual harassment for innocent hugs or kisses.By the way things are going, if a kindergartner falls on a girl in the schoolyard, he may be charged with anything from sexual harassment to attempted rape.It's totally crazy."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This book should be read by anyone who wants to know the true history of the women's movement and how that movement has been distorted over the past 30 or so years to fit the political agenda of left-wing activists who have no interest in women's equality."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"From the outset the pretensions of radical feminism have never been able to survive contact with either fact or argument.

I followed up on a lot of the research, checked many of the sources myself, and Kate O'Beirne's meticulous assembly of evidence stood the challenge. What this boils down to is the conflict of facts with ideology. O'Beirne provides facts. Ideologues don't want to hear them.The difference between an authentic feminist and the people who claim to speak for the movement is that an authentic feminist sees the difference between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. Women in the US have equality of opportunity. By ever-growing numbers, they choose to be mothers, they choose to embrace their femininity, and they recognize that they are born thinking and feeling differently than men. The women of NOW think that conditioning can overcome these differences, if they even acknowledge them. Authentic feminists realize that these differences are the glory of women. And they don't make women less intelligent or less capable than men.O'Beirne points out a body of evidence that proves beyond dispute that radical feminism has all but destroyed the family, and is ruining our children. She spends a chapter citing the damage done to boys in the classroom, and points out that by ever-greater numbers, young men aren't going on to college. This then creates a shortage of college-educated men for young women. This is a numerical, statistical FACT. Why then is it criminal to discuss it?Why is it verboten to point out that the children of single mothers are far more likely to end up in jail, use drugs, and fail academically? They are also more likely to be victims of child abuse and molestation. They are far more likely to be poor. These are also statistical facts. Why is it a betrayal of the sisterhood to seek to explain and fix the problem?Why, in a movement that supposedly promotes freedom of choice, is a stay-at-home mother assumed to be poorly educated, brainwashed, or a throwback to the 50's? Why is this choice not supported? If a woman chooses to put her career on hold to raise her children because she loves them, why is she insulted, smeared, and pilloried?Why is it the feminists oppose any and all war actions, when the War on Terror has liberated millions of severely oppressed women and given them unprecedented opportunity for education? An authentic feminist would be thrilled that these women are now voting and leading their communities.What's happening here even on Amazon is an attempt to simply shout down this book. The facts are indisputable, but that doesn't matter--it serves the cause. Rather than dealing with the issue, 'feminists' will ignore it. Rather than rallying to the cause of equality of opportunity, TRUE freedom of choice, and honestly improving the lot of women worldwide, those that call themselves feminists will shout insults, talking points, and twist O'Beirne's words out of any resemblance to what she actually said. Rather than focusing on raising strong, independent women AND men, they will continue to condemn ALL men, and this means YOUR sons, as the enemy, as a class of potential rapists. And men and women both will continue to suffer for it.Read the book, study the facts, and form your own opinion. An authentic feminist is a woman that doesn't need talking points or a chattering chorus to back her up. She actually looks at the evidence and thinks beyond her ideology. I've seen what feminism has made of the military. It's little more than a shelter for single mothers, and hunting grounds for irresponsible and honorless women who want a man. There are good female soldiers, but by and large, that's not who enlists. I've seen what feminism did to the men I went to school with not so long ago. O'Beirne is spot on in both her research and conclusions. Anyone with a shred of intellectual honesty would have first, read the book before reviewing it, and second, checked her research before dismissing the book as a whole."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This Book Should Be Called \\"Woman Who Hates Women Who Make The World Worse And The Corporate Tools Who Can't Figure Out Where Their Lives Went Wrong Wrong That Love Her.\\""},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I gradually moved from disturbed to appalled to simply outraged.

She has her point of view, and presents it - in person - aggressively but mostly fairly. I thought I'd find the same in her book.Instead, the book is a bilious diatribe against selected women. While Ms O-Beirne slams some successful women (primarily Hillary), she does not mention Elizabeth Dole, who I think I remember was alleged to have broken up Bob Dole's marriage and apparently chose a career over children. She does not mention Ann Coulter, who apparently has chosen cigarettes over family.The problems in America are not gender specific. Ms O'Beirne does not mention Rush Limbaugh and his narcotics addiction, nor does she mention Bill Bennett and his alleged problems with alcoholism, gambling, and vice in Las Vegas. Ms O'Beirne does not mention Tom Delay, Jack Abramhoff, and Duke Cunningham. Do these men not influence our children?

Camille Paglia successfully de-constructed much of \\"feminism\\", redefining it for her own uses, exposing the contradictions of trying to be powerful and victimized at the same time.

But after reading all the 1 star reviews from the lock-step lefties, I definitely plan to!"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"A book is not well-researched just because it contains references (and it does not properly reference all assertions/quotations used at that). Research would indicate that someone who cites study after study would actually include that study in the foot- or end- notes to indicate that primary research was undertaken. This author does not do that-- she cites secondary sources such as newspaper articles that excerpt or give a broad overview of the study/original reasearch on which O'Beirne is basing (or more accurately, supporting) her thesis. For instance, in a study of textbooks, the reference cites a \\"Washington Times\\" article entitled \\"Marriage Treated Harshly in Texts; Survey Gives an A to Only One of 20 Books College Use\\" another from the \\"Akron Beacon Journal\\" called \\"Study Says College Texts Paint a Grim Picture of Marriage'. While some monographs are used, the majority of the research is from daily newspapers and new magazines that, in all probability, were accessed by Lexis-Nexis. It is entirely unclear that the author has read any of the actual reasearch upon which she bases her assumptions. More likely, she uses these articles to prop up attitudes that were already held. This is something that I have noted in many contemporary authors including Ann Coulter.An honest critique of a person's (or a movement's, if this is even possible) ideas should not come from secondary sources when the primary material is readily available. Ruth Bader Ginsberg (as well as some of the other women derided in this book) has written a plethora of opinions, briefs and monographs... real research into her thought processes and ideological stances would cite her as the original source and critique the content from there. This is also true others in the book including Dr. Carol Gilligan and Catharine MacKinnon whom the author criticizes without directly presenting their views directly. The bulk of the \`statistics' and \`proof' in this book come from secondary and tertiary sources far removed from the original contexts. In fact, though the author makes it seem that feminist ideology is as pervasive as air, of the women she critiques, only infrequent note is made of actual textual evidence sourced to the author/person that she is referencing. O'Beirne takes easy shots at \\"The Feminist Mystique\\" and \\"The Female Eunuch\\" which were very important at the time of original publication, but have since become less relevant. These books now serve as sketches of a particular moment in history for a specific set of people (in the case of Friedan's 'Mystique', this would be upper-middle class white women) that are indeed, easily critique worthy (which is done quite extensively in Women's Studies classes). O'Beirne misses much of modern feminisms (please note the plural, which this author clearly does not) that encompass post-colonial thought, plurality, and more intricate theory. She is particularly virulent regarding those that are regarded as second wave feminists completely ignoring that which came after in which masculists and third-wave feminists challenge older conceptions of male and female power within modern societies. Concluding traditional gender roles enforced upon the sexes hurt both male and females by coercing them into positions they might not have chosen for themselves. Therefore, third-wave feminists and progressive masculists aim for freedom of choice for both sexes and gender egalitarianism. Current feminisms that express the importance of progressive family and child development are completely ignored. And this author does not even mention any type of modern thought/practice that involves alternative or queer theory.The author's overly repititious assertion that feminism is nothing but a job creation scheme/machine is tiresome especially as she seems particularly loathe to admit that any of the historical issues undergirding feminist theory, praxis and action actually existed. She actually goes so far as to assert that oppressive systems of patriarchy are, at least in part, the creation of women: \\"much of what society values-- art, language, and morality-- appears to have arisen as the result of female regulation of male behavior... [indicating] evidence that the dreaded male patriarchy, which values status and achievement, might well have developed in response to what women wanted in their men. If women's preferences are responsible for the patriarchy, in what sense can they be said to be oppressed by it?\\" (82-3).I did not expect a balanced, intellectual discussion of issues (seriously, look at the dust jacket) but the author is an editor at a fairly well-respected conservative magazine and should thus be able to give a good overview of conservative thought. She does manage to degrade (I know-- how is this possible) the national dialogue making statements like: \\"I have long thought that if high-school boys had invited homely girls to the prom we might have been spared the feminist movement. We live with the destructive feminist agenda because the fathers or husbands of so many of them, including Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and Jane Fonda, never failed to fail them. The views of these angry, abandoned women inform the modern women's movement.\\" A couple of the hypotheses are quite interesting (i.e. the pay gap, women in the military) and warrant real research. However, much of this book is taken so far from its contextual moorings, that it is very hard to seriously consider the majority of the claims made if one is not already predisposed to the author's worldview and preconceptions."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.

On the contrary, Ms. O'Beirne seems to have passed with high marks the course \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope (And They'll Hang Themselves)\\". None of the women she skewers are owed anything by O'Beirne or anyone else, male or female, for any advances women have made or experienced. Indeed, such might be labeled point number one in a summary of the book. Secondly, she quite forthrightly proceeds to wrap the women of the far left in chains of their own making--thus would be point number two. The gist of the book is exactly what the title claims--a report on women who do, as a matter of fact, make the world worse.Ms. O'Beirne has not written the best possible book on the subject, but she has writtten, I believe, the best so far. When read by a thoughtful mind, progress is made. I recommend the book not so much for those of the far left that will convulse and spray spittle in response, but for those who consider themselves \\"moderates\\" and wish, generally, not to \\"choose sides\\". Ms. O'Beirne is not of the \\"far right\\", though many will claim otherwise, or have already done so. She represents what a moderate should be, if our world weren't already out of plumb.

All women should read this - lets take back our country."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Blaming our social ills on the feminist is narrow-minded and stupid. Many of the women sited are based on the extreme perspective and do not have massive followings or have a large impact on the average American woman. Most American women fall somewhere in between hard-core feminist and radical-right zombies. This probably never would occur to the author: \\"the reason most women are attempting to gain financial security in their own right, is not because they don't want a mother-at-home environment, but rather, many got tired of being 'dumped' by their husbands for someone younger, and/or more beautiful after years of 'family dedication'\\". And if \\"being dumped\\" were the only issue, that in itself is not the real problem as much as divorce usually leaves the woman and children in a state of financial poverty. The government offers little to protect them or their children. Perhaps a country such as ours, where men who do not pay child-support suffer no ill effects on their credit-ratings and many spend a life-time eluding their financial responsibilities, contributes a dramatic portion to the family break-down. Most mothers I know, hate having to leave their children to work, but they do not have a choice, and many others just do not trust the man to be there until death, so why sit around waiting for the shoe to fall, when in the end, poverty is what surely awaits them? So, if anyone is to blame, it's a governmental system that allows men to abandon their responsibilities to their wives and children with little consequences and authors like this one who deter the public attention away from the real issues. It is so much simpler to site a small group and place blame on them, while neglecting the root of the problem and actually having to offer some constructive solutions that may actually work. I suppose if 'selling books' resolves the authors financial issues, it justifies putting other women in a lose/lose situation."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This book has an interesting cover with clever characatures of the usual suspects: Hitlery, Babs, Hanoi Jane, etc.What's written inside is crap."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"There are many women like us who are sick of the way feminists have twisted things around to suit them...

Despite its cartoonish cover and inappropriately flamboyant title, WOMEN WHO MAKE THE WORLD WORSE by Kate O'Beirne is one of the best. O'Beirne does several things right. She hits feminists with the facts, points out several aspects of their ideology riddled with inconsistencies, writes with humor and wit and, best of all, hits feminists hard without the verbal fluff other writers have used to soften the blows.In some ways, it is depressing that WWMTWW even needed to be written. Some of the falsehoods spread by feminists have been exposed so often and so thoroughly that it is breathtaking that they are still around. It is nothing short of ridiculous that there are intelligent, well-educated people out there who still genuinely believe that women make 70 cents to a man's dollar when they do not. It is even more depressing that feminists have been able to successfully eviscerate college men's sporting teams and undermine our military capabilities, without one scrap of concern for the people affected or even our nation's security, simply because not enough people have the backbone to stand up to them. Any other group that showed as little, or more accurately no, concern for an entire segment of our population as feminists have shown for men would be marginalized to the point of uselessness.Unfortunately, feminists have not been so marginalized and the facts are what they are and we have to deal with it. O'Beirne addresses these issues and others and does so very, very effectively. Many of the points she makes in the book can be found elsewhere, but so what. Feminists have spread their misinformation not by saying things only once but by saying it over and over and over. Any attempt to clarify matters with facts must use the same tactic.That is not to say there is nothing original in WWMTWW. O'Beirne brings a fresh approach to several areas that have been underaddressed. Feminists like to deny differences between men and women. Yet many feminists deny this and claim they in fact do recognize that men and women differ in important ways. Maybe. But I have noticed that the differences feminists acknowledge consistently fall along ideological rather than scientific lines and only affect feminist policy when it benefits them. O'Beirne is the first author I have encountered to call them on this. Another area in which O'Beirne brings a more original voice includes an analysis of the bogus gender gap in politics. In fact, it is the political left which suffers a greater gender gap among men than the right does among women. As O'Beirne notes, the feminist rhetoric on the left has been costly.O'Beirne missteps when she points out that many feminists cannot let go of their policies because their jobs depend on them. While true, it misses the point. Anyone who has conversed with them knows that feminists have been sucked so deeply into an ideological vortex that other issues, like holding onto their money, are secondary.The biggest problem with WWMTWW is what O'Beirne has not adequately addressed and it is typical for books of this genre. Feminists typically answer criticism by stating that there is a wide diversity within feminism and that critics are only pointing to the worst. This statement is interesting because it is technically true, there are different types of feminists, but grossly misleading. And failing to directly address it is the biggest mistake of those who take feminists on.A better interpretation is that these feminists, who often call themselves moderates, do absolutely nothing at all when their more radical sisters attack. If moderate feminists did not raise up and demand the termination of Vassar's dean of student life when she voiced her opinion that being falsely accused of rape is good for men, then they will never - never - do anything. Yet these so called moderates are always right there to yap away endlessly when someone else comes along and criticizes feminism instead. And despite the fact that they have not put one scrap of effort into doing anything constructive within their own movement, they will show a limitless amount of energy in obstructing someone who does.With this in mind, one should think of these feminists quite differently. Any organization, be it a political movement or a neighborhood softball team, has a division of labor. Some people are pitchers, some are catchers, some are sluggers. Moderate feminists are part of the same organization as the radicals and are such for the same general reason, i.e. they believe men to be the oppressor class and women the oppressed. The difference is that the moderates have decided to play defense rather than offense yet expect the rest of us to view them as totally different than others within feminism. They are not.But a book cannot be everything, I suppose. As long as feminists are still spreading misinformation and advancing their radical agenda without concern for the human consequences, any counteroffensive is welcome. WOMEN WHO MAKE THE WORLD WORSE is therefore a very welcome addition indeed."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"And I'm glad I did. Ms. O'Beirne's good writing, thorough research and copious quotes from feminists themselves combine to make a strong argument for rethinking what form our goal of equality between the sexes should take.As a woman who was swayed by many feminist arguments in college, I have come around to seeing things Kate's way. Raising two boys (and comparing notes with friends raising girls) has opened my eyes to the inherent differences between the sexes that existed before anyone ever handed them a doll or truck. And now that they're teenagers, I'm more grateful than ever for my husband's and my instinctively different styles of parenting. Our kids need both: my softer nurturing and their dad's unwavering firmness. Men and women are different and that's a GOOD thing.

These books criticize \\"gender\\" feminism (a form of the mental illness known as \\"political correctness\\") as opposed to \\"equity\\" feminism, but the one-star reviewers don't seem to know that (for example, due to \\"gender\\" feminism's ties to socialism, \\"gender\\" feminism gets no credit for helping women get property rights -- how could it, when socialists, by definition, don't believe in property rights?).I suspect such reviews are overwhelmingly the work of \\"gender\\" feminists (aka \\"feministas\\" and \\"feminazis\\") who never read books they don't agree with.

O'Beirne shows us their left wing propaganda; emotionalism over rational thinking; the myths they spew; and lies they tell; She also snows us the self destructiveness of the feminist movement. O'Beirne shows how these leftist theories, put into practice, have hurt women badly over the last forty years, instead of helped them; in fact have devastated many women, society, family life, schools and workplaces., O'Beirne shows us how the feminists have been on a war against males and how millions of school age boys have and are suffering because of them.

The author takes liberal ideas to task, but states them in a way that is meant to change your beliefs rather than make you think. The 'science' if you will could have been better. Also, more imaginative use of allegory and metaphor to make folks think would probably be more sucessful.As a full-time professional and a mom, I fully appreciate some of the fruits of the 'feminist' movement - women being allowed into medicine and academics. Maybe women would have wound up there anyway, by dint of hard work and outstanding performance...but I don't want it legislated that EVERYONE has the right to be a doctor to avoid discrimination...The book is meant to underscore that there has been unintended consequences and poor outcomes resulting from society trying to legislate equality. For instance, making unwed mothers celebrated has created an underclass in society that has very little hope of reaching equality by any legitimate means. Most women who have children out of wedlock do not have the money or support-system to raise a child that will be able to take advantage of everything soceity has to offer. The book isn't asking us to return to castigation of unwed mothers and removing their children from them - just that we should consider that swallowing hook-line-and-sinker the feminist dogma hasn't resulted in something better.Anyone who reads the book with an open mind might start to think that we have come to some wrong conclusions, despite noble intentions. Unfortunately the book did not do a better job of initiating thought.Certainly, pointing the finger at individuals as icons of a 'faith' is always problematic because it makes it easier for people of a 'faith' to reject any observations - even if the arguments are cogent."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I'm amazed at the vituperation from the Left about this book -- especially since so many of them admittedly refuse to read it.

In Women Who Make the World Worse, National Review's Kate O'Beirne takes on America's leading feminists: Hillary Clinton, Gloria Steinem, Eleanor Smeal, Maureen Dowd, Kate Michelman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and even Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw. She opposes their propagandistic Leftist emotionalism and self-important grandstanding with irrefutable evidence that the feminist movement -- including some of those very women -- has hurt women far more than it has helped them over the last forty years. Women Who Make the World Worse shows how feminism has devastated American society: fracturing families; making American schools and workplaces into battlefields to advance feminist causes; and exalting working women among mothers and consigning millions of children to a soulless upbringing by daycare center employees. Through it all, O'Beirne shows that feminists have poisoned American public discourse about gender issues with politically charged claptrap about how a hostile patriarchy makes women its helpless victims.Yet O'Beirne proves here that it is actually men - and boys - who are bearing a considerable amount of the actual suffering. Millions of schoolboys are being feminized in American classrooms; boys' sports are in retreat in schools everywhere; the \\"gender gap\\" deforms local and national politics; millions of husbands and fathers (and wives and mothers) believe that men are not needed in the raising of children; and worst of all, transforming the American military into a laboratory for large-scale social engineering puts us all at risk.O'Beirne establishes that the feminist agenda is at its core not pro-female at all; it's merely anti-male. She demolishes the prevailing myth among feminists that men are the enemy of women's progress. This provocative book is essential reading for anyone, male or female, who is looking for some old-fashioned common sense about relations between the sexes.Revealed -- Feminism's war on men, the family, and the military:How feminists insist that there are no innate differences between men and women -- except when they find it convenient to argue the oppositeThe prominent feminist who dismissed the traditional family as a \\"storybook idea\\"The husband of a famous feminist who advised men not to marry feminists!How feminists ignored good news about declines in domestic violence rates and trumped up a \\"national epidemic\\" of such violence -- largely in order to keep themselves employedWhy the feminist movement has for so long been on a collision course with what we know to be true about the natural bond between mother and childThe feminist leader who refused to acknowledge overwhelming evidence that most working women would prefer to stay at home, and that parents don't want the government-run programs that she advocates for toddlersHypocrisy: how the liberal proponents of center-based child care are in reality advocating the boosting of profits for big business, tax cuts for the rich, and the sabotaging of women's choicesHow the media generally mimics feminist talking points and ignores the mountains of evidence that disproves feminist orthodoxyDisproved: the common myth that women with similar education, skills, and job experience work for salaries 25 percent less than those of menWomen who wised up after mistakenly heeding the calls of feminist sirens to put off marriage and motherhood to chase career goalsIt's sexual harassment if I say so: feminists who actually argue that whether or not actionable sexual harassment has taken place must be judged by a subjective standard based on what any particular woman might find offensiveHow the feminist theory on sexual harassment is clearly based on the work of Catharine McKinnon, who declared that all heterosexual intercourse was rapeThe destructive gender war in our schools and universities: how it has harmed girls, boys, and serious scholarshipHow gender warriors treat American boys as unindicted coconspirators in history's gender crimes, while girls are taught to see themselves as helpless victims of a phantom, crippling gender biasSocial engineering in the classroom: how it has become ever rarer for feminized, feminist educators to present boys with strong male role modelsDebunked: the feminist insistence that girls' comparative lack of interest in athletics is the result of gender discrimination and social conditioning to avoid traditionally male activitiesHow Title IX has not actually increased the number of girls playing sports, and has harmed athletic programs in generalWomen in combat: why it's a bad idea -- and how it's endangering our troops in IraqThe myth, uncritically hyped by the media, that our patriarchal culture silences adolescent girlsThe double standard demanded by feminists for women in the military: it isn't confined only to physical testsHow feminists exploit the abuse and deaths of young women in combat situations to advance their agenda of androgyny and abortionHow feminist political activists consistently refuse to face the implications of the fact that Republicans have been winning more presidential elections than Democrats -- and even carrying more of the female voteThe female Army Captain who successfully completed a mission to secure a dog kennel -- and was hailed by the politically correct establishment as a new McArthur or Patton!Why modern feminism's biggest enemies are the smallest of all humans: the unbornExploded: the persistent myth that most women support the feminists' abortion-on-demand agendaThe pro-life agenda: is it really a vote-killer, as both parties seem to believe?

Had we known, I am sure we would have done things differently. After all, she is only first in her class in high school, athletic, well liked, respected and being courted by top colleges while still in her sophomore year. I suppose, if we followed this authors advice, she would have been a better person, although I fail to see how.The author believes, strongly, that women should stay home from work to raise children, no matter what the cost. Since I was the one to stay home, as my wife earned about 40% more than I at the time, we were putting our daughter at risk. In addition, we put her at risk by putting her into a limited day care, even though my daughter enjoyed it and wanted to continue when we attempted to pull her out. The author makes it clear that we should have moved from our house to an apartment, and given up our standard of living to allow my wife to stay home and me to continue work. That would have been what was best for our daughter. There is not alternate method allowed in her world.Then there is the issue of sexual discrimination, which does not occur according to this author. It can't occur, other than on a limited basis, because market forces would keep it from occurring. Companies need women, and if discrimination were happening, women would quit, which would leave companies understaffed. If that were the case, I guess when my wife was told, during a performance review, that all women belonged at home taking care of the children and not working in corporate America, she was hearing things. In the author's world, that didn't occur, and neither did the large settlement from the company after the manager's treatment of women employees was exposed.I could go on, but I think you get the point. There is an old saying about lies, damned lies and statistics, and it fits this book well. Much of it is the author's own view, with little to substantiate the opinion. The author misses the point, for the most part, that all people are not the same and that one size does not fit all. It is fine that she wishes to lead her life in the fashion that she does, but she makes no allowance for others to lead theirs in a different manner. If they do, they will fail themselves, their children, etc.The author does, on occasion, make valid points, but they are too few and too far apart to make the book a worthwhile read, unless you want to lead a life trapped in the 1950s. While I agree that the feminist movement has gone over the edge, they have also done a lot to move the country forward and there is no credit given for that work."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"O'Beirne has identified a troubling phenomenon of modern feminists in power: they make the world worse.

Just as teenagers often go to great lengths to establish their independence at a certain age; some women feel the need to lash out at what they see as the vestiges of male domination. What they wind up doing, though, is directing most of their venom at the men who deserve it least but are most willing to put up with it. What women should be doing is examining the philosophical implications of choosing their own destinies. One can not have one's cake and eat it too. That is not a limitation placed on women by men; it is a simple fact of the universe we live in. Generations of kept women have demanded that their men work harder and earn more so that proverbial cake could be both eaten and had. Their men responded by working themselves to death. Today's feminists are demanding more government to give them the things they think they deserve. The world cannot survive more experiments in Socialism. Ladies, it's time to wrap up the adolescent thing and start acting like the adults you claim to be."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"In the Sixties I supported my girlfriend's (and eventual wife's) interest in and support for feminism. Since then both she and I - no longer married but still friends - wonder how feminism was changed from an essentially humanist improvement in society to the divisive, hate-filled, attack on men, families, and children. The word \\"feminist\\" needs to be discarded and feminists shunned. Then, perhaps, can our American Society mature and re-assert our humanist roots.Kate O'Beirne, with this book, helps us in this endeavor. She speaks in support of all humans."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Kate O'Beirne discusses some excellent points about radical feminism, from the military and sports to the destruction wrought on boys in the education system and on men in family courts.She never once attacks the women who have fought for equality, those women who 'paved the way' for her to be in a position to denounce the level of discrimination supported by some people who obviously haven't read the book. Offering choices to women should not dictate that we ignore the level of discrimination practiced by modern feminists and outlined in this book.Telling men what they can and cant do in order to elevate female privilege and double standards is not something I believe early women fighting for equality would be proud of.Take the time to look in to the issues Kate discusses, she references them well, and take a balanced approach to the negative reviews that have been organized through feminist websites to bring down the books rating."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Kate O'Beirne was the only intelligent voice on the now defunct show Capital Gang. She made the shrill Al Hunt, Mark Shields, Margaret Carlson and yes even the conservative Robert Novak look like mental pigmies by comparison. She always brought facts and logic to the table, but she did so with a style and grace that kept her above the fray. Now she has written a book on a subject in which she has considerable expertise - the harm that the modern feminist movement has wrought on both women, men and children.Mrs. O'Bierne, has been a member of some government panels studying the effects of the feminist ideology on our institutions. She has written a logical and focussed book, that will persuade anyone with an open mind to facts and basic logic.If you read many of the reviews by the more \\"progressive\\" posters you will find a lot of hateful invective and outright lies and paranoia. This is what passes for intellectual rigor in this group anymore. A shame really. It is no wonder - this excellent book skewers yet another liberal sacred cow. Note: there is an internet campaign by \\"progressives\\" to submit fake bad reviews of this book (whether they read it or not) to drive down the ratings. It is their hope that a low rating will result in poor sales. I guess they think their ideas and the effects of their ideology can't withstand scrutiny, but we all knew that anyway. They are trying to \\"Dan Rather\\" this book.This book is well sourced and written in a style that even a \\"progressive\\" should be able to understand - that is if they have an open enough mind to actually read this book. My recommendation is to ignore the reviews. Period! [unless its mine of course]. Judge this book for yourself. Read it with an open mind and make your own decision. Don't let others bias you. Remember, many of the negative reviews posted here are from people who never even read this book. They are lies put out as part of a \\"Progressive\\" propaganda campaign. Note the reflexive \\"Bush is the antichrist\\" retoric as well in many of the reviews. Would rational, mature people behave like this?Take a stand against \\"progressive\\" censorship and buy this book. But look down with pity on the \\"progressives\\". Hatred and anger are all they have left. They know their ideas have been throuroghly discredited and they are throwing a temper tantrum.This is why they don't even try to debate anymore. Truly sad, but it keeps my side in power."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Total waste of money. An ugly duck complaining about women who are out in the world living full lives and expressing their freeedom of choice. Her writing is full of (not so) repressed resentment over beautiful and/or talented woman succeeding in a man's world."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"KATE O'BEIRNE's book, 'WOMEN WHO MAKE THE WORLD WORSE' is an excellent overview of the destructive and dishonest aims of the Feminist movement; it clearly illustrates the fallacies upon which that movement is based and the myriad ways that all of society is negatively impacted by its preposterously extremist and psychologically warped theology. (Yes, \\"theology\\" because Feminism is not unlike some fanatical religious cult.)I fear that O'Beirne may have done her book a disservice by giving it a silly title and having the cover display caricatures of some prominent misandrists who do indeed make the world worse. The subject of this book is too important and the text too seriously researched and revealing to be wrapped in a goofy dust jacket that might cause it to be misinterpreted as nothing more than a fast-buck Republican screed. That's not what this is and I assure you that the old maxim \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" certainly applies here.I strongly urge you to read 'WOMEN WHO MAKE THE WORLD WORSE' even though I nearly gave it only 4 stars for the following reasons:* While the book's 199 pages are nicely organized and densely packed with eye-opening meat 'n' potatoes information, I felt that the text could have been expanded and the subject explored even deeper. The book stands as a thorough overview of Feminism, but it is not a comprehensive treatise on the subject.* Missing is any significant examination of Socialism's part in perverting the healthy gender roles in our society. In his 'COMMUNIST MANIFESTO', Karl Marx wrote \\"The Communists everywhere SUPPORT EVERY REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AGAINST THE EXISTING SOCIAL and political ORDER OF THINGS...The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible OVERTHROW OF ALL EXISTING SOCIAL CONDITIONS.\\" Overlooked by most researchers and commentators on Feminism is the fact that undergirding and promoting the whole movement is (and always has been) socialists in positions of power and influence. THE GREAT IRONY is that without the muscle of MALE socialists in congress, journalism, television, film, education, publishing, and in the judiciary, the Feminists could NEVER have made the advances that they have in the past 40 years. (And by \\"advances\\" I don't mean laudable progression; I'm talking more like territory taken in battle during an unjust and deceptive ground war!)* Curiously absent is any mention of the inadvisability of having women employed as officers at the street (or \\"beat\\") level of law enforcement. Just as O'Beirne accurately decries the lowering of previously established physical standards for military combat and firefighting positions in order to accommodate women, the same has occurred within the law enforcement community. (Space does not permit me to give a detailed accounting of the many ways female police officers have inadvertently endangered fellow officers and the public at large, and whose presence can sometimes unnecessarily escalate volatile situations in the field. Male officers are constrained by department policy and a desire to be promoted through the ranks from speaking openly their thoughts on the subject of female cops, but get them to talk \\"off-the-record\\", as I have done, and you'll learn the various reasons why the vast majority of them oppose the idea.)* And finally, O'Beirne is the Washington Editor of NATIONAL REVIEW magazine founded by her guru, NeoCon, William F. Buckley Jr., the Skull And Bones \\"adept\\", Bilderberger participant, and Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member. If that doesn't set any alarm bells ringing in your mind then \\"you've got a long way to go, baby!\\" (Be sure to read my Amazon guide, 'SO YOU'D LIKE TO...SEE THE NEW WORLD ORDER IN BLACK & WHITE' when you're done here.)Nevertheless, I gave this publication 5 stars because of O'Beirne's Sense O'Humor, and because she has written a fine and valuable book on a dire issue, and also because I knew 5 stars would anger the Feminists (and the males they rule) a full one-fifth more than 4 stars would!Here are some excerpts from 'WOMEN WHO MAKE THE WORLD WORSE':[Page XIV] (A law firm) recruiter asked me, \\"What do you expect to be in ten years?\\" I was expected to say something about being a hardworking partner or about specializing in some esoteric area of the law or something equally dry. I said that I expected to be about five years older.\\"[Page XV] Most radical feminists are qualified for only one job: professional feminist.[Page 14] In 1960, only 9 percent of all children lived in single-parent households. Presently in the United States, almost one third of children are born to single mothers.[Page 36] Dr. Benjamin Spock, who, after frankly informing 1950s mothers that day nurseries are \\"no good for infants\\", deleted this advice from 1990s editions of his manual 'BABY AND CHILD CARE', which has sold millions. He explained that such advice would make working mothers feel guilty, and he recognized they were heading to work regardless. Spock admitted: \\"It's a cowardly thing that I did; I just tossed it in subsequent editions.\\" Feminist intimidation has created plenty of cowards.[Page 98] Title IX has been four times more effective in eliminating male athletes than in developing female athletes.[Page 119] Feminists recognize the vulnerability of women when they are concerned with the plight of women who are victims of domestic abuse...Their position on integrating combat ranks puts them in the position of saying that violence against women is a terrible thing unless it is at the hands of the enemy, in which case it's a welcome tribute to women's equality...Minimizing the feats of men and exaggerating those of women is a familiar feminist tactic to promote their woman-as-warrior myth.Personally, my greatest concern is that unless these extremist Wacky Women are stopped, they will eventually transform men (myself included) into the very mangy misogynist dogs they've always accused us of being. Nah, who am I kidding? My biggest fear is that so many Feminists (and the males they rule) will attack this review with so many negative votes that I'll suffer a nervous breakdown and cry like a little girl.Read O'Beirne's book because - as the Brut Cologne commercial says - \\"MEN ARE BACK.\\"* (*Pending permission from women to remain.)"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"While I didn't love the book, it is an incredible effort on kate's part to portray her views on feminism. Anyone who calls this book 'unsupported' clearly did not read it. It is fine to disagree with her, but it is NOT fine to NOT support her right to author this book. What is the problem with raging liberals and dissenting opinion? It seems that they are the fascists when they go to extreme lengths to keep people from reading/hearing people like Kate O'beirne and other conservatives (I'm hip to the 'let's get the 5-star rating to the bottom so that nobody wants to buy this book' effort). It's fine to not support Kate, but by God, support her right to express her views. This is AMERICA!!!I know a little bit about Kate, and she is so smart, so educated, so successful, and seems to be so lovable as a person....someone a girl can look up to.

I don't know what else anyone expects. The scholarship behind the book is suspect, and yes, you can definitely spot the sections where she hopes you won't notice that she's not offering verifiable proof of a concept or an idea - in either direction. There are a lot of quotes, and again, a lot of them on both sides of the fence are probably taken out of context. That's why the book gets 3 stars. This is not an overly intellectual discussion of the subject at hand.The content of the book is interesting, and thought-provoking, but not all that surprising. Anyone with their eyes open already knows about a lot of the things the author condemns, such as anti-marriage activism and the daycare conundrum. Yes, the kooky feminists scare me, but so do the kooky traditionalists.As I continued to read the book, and be presented with shrill quotes from what the author obviously considers sinister feminists out to get all the conservative normal women, and then the author's flat, eye rolling rebuttals, the thought that continued to come to mind was, can't you just live and let live? Who cares? These women - on both sides - are so obviously out of touch with reality that I can't say that either opinion does me any good. Had the author injected any more earnest discussion into the book, it might have helped. The only thing she succeeded in doing was convincing me that the government and our culture is more screwed up than ever, and as usual, the average Jane is going to live as she's always lived."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Good book, solid, based on facts, and convincing.

I find 2 references (with quotes) and 2 statistics. This is fairly typical. There are 7 chapters with around 40 references per chapter.If I had to glean one conclusion from reading all of Kate's book, it is that many feminist organisations have mistakenly claimed to represent women in general. They do not. The diversity of opinion among women is substantial, and the key views of feminist organisations are not shared by many women."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"I really hate to say it, but this book was not all that great. It seemed to me that the author was just making extreme statements to sell a book. There was really nothing of substance in there to keep me interested.Call me picky, but I also found the spelling and grammer mistakes to be quite distracting. It seems that if you're asking people to spend money on a book, you would at least pay someone to edit it... It seemed to be put together on the cheap, and I found that to be Very unprofessional.I'll give her 2 stars for the theme of the book, but overall I felt that this book was a waste of my money.

For example, the first critic \\"ranmasan\\" says there's no proof, but anything adduced in support of O'Beirne's premises would be less obvious than the obvious premises she has. Some premises concern her reference to gender mis-scholarship in Sweden and America, others to the well known Social Constructionism of academic feminism in the US. The feminist Constructionism, holding that notions of such things as \\"gender\\" and \\"family\\" are mere cultural fabrications, ignores biological and medical research and is used by O'Beirne to cogently conclude that some influential women have had an inordinate influence on making the world worse -- worse for ORDINARY WOMEN. In revealing that these elitest women and their toadies are either intellectually dishonest or stupid, and they're not stupid, O'Beirne underscores that they have to be confronted and exposed -- the exposure starting with women! She along with Christina Sommers, Daphne Patai, Noretta Koertge and others, are beginning to right the wrongs; as evidenced by the hysteria of their patronizing \\"feminist sisters.\\""},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Not since \\"Total Woman\\" has a conservative gone so far off the deep end.

At a time when Alito is about to be confirmed, and the supreme court is about to lead us to a new dark ages, we should all be alarmed by the likes of this writing.

If being preached at is your thing, whether part of the choir or no, then perhaps this would work for you. Otherwise, it is not informative and is in many respects simply illogical -- it does not hold together on its own terms. As an example, the chapter on the de-feminizing aspects of fashion utterly ignores the fact that fashion is designed by men, not women. Also, just because there is a fashion trend does not mean a particular fashion style is ubiquitous (see Laura Ashley).I am in part affected, I admit, by the fact that the author is a scold -- a \\"do as I say, not as I do,\\" person. If she were a man, she would be of the \\"keep them barefoot and pregnant\\" ilk.

Now, as with that John and Yoko classic (recently re-released with much improved sound), the premise seems a bit dated, and the us/them typology a bit musty.

Hardly. I found the book, like I find Ms. O'Beirne when I see her on the talk shows, to be perfectly pleasant and well-intentioned, but completely unexceptional and rather obvious. Kate always seems on TV like an aunt or relative who's just a bit out-of-it, culture-wise, sipping her Manhattan and railing against those \\"Gloria Steinem types.\\" Does that make her a bad person? Of course not. But this is a book for those who already know what it is going to say and is happy to read it again, and agree with it because it is exactly what they believe in also.

She then gives examples in parts of her book that completely contradict her claim of how feminism is harmful and unnecessary (if you're curious, a pretty good one is on page 95). Her lists of what \\"destructive\\" actions feminists have done are pointless, since most people would just look through said lists and think, \\"Hmm, I don't think I've EVER thought awareness of domestic violence was a problem...actually, how are any of these things bad again?\\" She makes statements that she claims are facts but in actuality are just opinions that are skewed with half-truths and faulty cause-and-effect logic. The only way anyone could appreciate this book is if they already agreed with her views in the first place, because she doesn't do a good job proving her case otherwise.I'd say that out of the entire book, if you're looking for logical, sound arguments that are worth considering for the other side's point of view, maybe twelve pages are worth reading.

Let's try this again.If it had been written better, it might have been marketable as a work of political humor, and could even have been done well in that genre. Unfortunately, the selective presentation of facts and statistics, as well as their creative interpretation, would get her thrown out of even the most conservative of universities if it had been presented as a serious scholarly work.Kate O'Beirne manages to take all three of the common fallacies in inductive logic and turn them into a book. Some examples (I'm not even going to get into deductive logic, I'd be here all night):Composition: Exclusive Attachment Syndrome is being argued for by these specific liberal academics, therefore all liberal academics are arguing to separate children more from their mothers. There's another use of the fallacy of Composition that works very well to illustrate the problem with it: Racial Profiling.False Analogy: The most radical of the \\"feminists\\" hate men and want to undercut their achievements. \\"moderate\\" feminists and \\"radical\\" feminists are both feminists. Therefore, anyone who is a feminist hates men and wants to undercut their achievements. Do I really need to explain the problem with this one?Hasty Generalization: Title IX has hurt these specific sports programs for men (most specifically wrestling, if I recall), therefore it has hurt collegiate sports. Never mind that the number of students that participate in sports in college was and is a small minority of the student body, both before and after Title IX, and that new sports for women are implicitly less valued.The people that appear on the cover are in no way responsible for or informed by the positions of radical Leninist feminism, any more than the current Administration are card-carrying members of the John Birch Society. This book is argued from a deeply Essentialist position: That the way we are is etched indelibly in us at birth because of our gender. People on both extremes of the nature/nurture debate need to get over themselves and sit down, because there is not one solidly documented bit of research to prove it is anything but a combination of both.Statements by either side of the debate, such as the extreme social position she argues against with all the fury and excitement of a five-year-old whacking a pinata (that all we are is determined by our environment), and her own bias (As Douglas Adams might put it: that women are women, men are men, and small fuzzy creatures from Alpha Centauri are small fuzzy creatures from Alpha Centauri; so it is now, so it has been, and so shall it ever be.) are both unhelpful and destructive. It's not good or wise to silence these points of view, but it is very good to call people who espouse them on it.[...]"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Ms. O'Beirne hits the target with this book.

They arrived within two days and what an eye opener.Wanted so badly to like the book and like the author in many, many ways. But am giving it 4 stars simply because its really interesting and has some interesting history and information. Maybe were the author more pleasant to watch in interviews, my opinion of her would be of a more positive, gentle woman. But she grates on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. But so do a lot of people who profess to being 'pro-life'.And I say this as someone who has been there and done that as far as being faced with an unexpected pregnancy, that thank God (literally I believe) I got thru. But the author isn't the type of woman I think most women faced with an unexpected, much less unwanted pregnancy, would feel comfortable going to for help or advise. Again I wanted to like Kate O'Beirne so dang bad!What troubles me with this book is how it starts out with what I consider a mis truth. On the Introduction page where the author writes 'On March 11, 2005 accused felon Brian Nichols overpowered Deputy Sheriff Cynthia Hall in the Atlanta courthouse where she worked, and killed four people before surrendering the following day. We weren't supposed to notice the insanity of a petite fifty one year old grandmother guarding a former college football linebacker who had been caught with two sharpened door hinges in his socks earlier in the week. The local sheriffs office had adopted the politically correct premise that men and women are interchangeable and only misogynist males would deny a willing woman any job she sought. The recent deaths in Atlanta are just a recent concrete example of what feminism has wrought'.Fact is it was the misguided policy and no oversight that allowed the accused felon to have access to a gun be it a male or female deputy. An oversight the Sheriff has taken great effort to change. Secondly the author is sexist and short sighted to think that just because a woman is petite and over a certain age that she cant handle a big guy. Ask any of us who are mothers of sons, or who hunt and dress out and carry out an elk or deer during hunting season. Or the women who work out daily have less than 10% body fat and are fit healthy and strong.Then there is the fact that during the interview Mr. Russert asked point blank if the author was a feminist to which she replied she was not. Yet, when it serves her purpose she writes in Chapter 8 Abortion the Holy Grail, about early feminists who were not for legalized abortion as well as the head and spokesfolk for Feminists for Life , which I happen to be a paid member of. I do all I can to help women who do not want an abortion. To the point that we have at our own expense, housed unwed mothers. Wonder how many the author has housed and supported.The author also uses the term pro-abortion lot when in fact I know of few if any who are pro-abortion which suggests in 2006 that someone demands someone have an abortion. Same with the term pro-life which often suggests dont abort the fetus but to heck once the child is born, unless you demand women adopt the child out. Or that pro life to me also means caregiving the elderly, disabled etc. Not just nine months before we are born.And maybe it's just me but her whole demeanor makes me think she wouldn't be someone I would turn to if I was faced with an unwanted pregnancy, abusive husband or other horrid event in my life. She just comes off so cold and rigid. Wish she would work on this, so she comes off a bit more soft and caring. Again I like the author in many ways, and wish I could like her more.She also notes on page 8 'Feminists want engineering and math programs, for example to be 50 percent female. They don't seem to care that men are under represented in nursing and dance programs'. She seems to think that Warren Farrells book Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap -- and What Women Can Do About It is a great source, despite the fact he writes that women want careers that require a degree in French not jobs that demand hard work etc. These two authors completely ignore that most nursing schools have a lot of male students. What about the women who want the hard dirty jobs? And since females out number makes, from a percentage standpoint, I think its normal to expect women to out number men in most college classes.She then on page 109 writes about the Augusta National Golf Club and the desire of some women (not all were feminists) to allow women as members. Never mind the same golf course had not allowed any black members as well, thus the complaint was how could television televise a golf tournament from an organization that was so private that they allowed discrimination.In Chapter 6 G I Janes the author rails against women in military combat ignoring that women are citizens and should be allowed to defend their country the same way as any man is allowed. And that the majority in our military serve with honour and never cause any problems.On page 145 she begins writing about women as running mates and says or at least suggests that it was Mondales choice in Geraldine Ferraro that lost the race, when in fact many women like myself voted for Reagan in part because he was the better candidate and for me personally I couldn't handle Mondale and Ferraro who both had that obnoxious nasal speaking voice that was like fingernails on a chalkboard. Made me not want to even listen.On page 154 the author writes 'When John Tower was nominated to be Secretary of Defense in 1989 and allegations of adultery surfaced, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD)manned the barricades to prevent someone who 'so clearly demonstrates disrespect for women' from taking the top Pentagon job'. Never mind that a lot of male Republicans didn't want the man in the job because he had serious alcohol issues!Now look at the cover and one sees not so flattering drawings depicting Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Senator Hillary Clinton, and a fictional character from the HBO series Sex In The City aka Carrie. Good grief Carrie was a fictional character not a 'real' woman. And a 'woman' whom few real women admired outside of the fantasy world she lived in.Then look at the back of the dust jacket and one sees Rush Limbaugh writing a blurb praising the author and her book. The same Rush Limbaugh who is now divorcing for the third time after ten years with wife #3? Not much of a conservative who loves tradition, marriage and all that good stuff in my opinion.While reading this book I kept thinking of fellow Stanford Alumna former Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who having graduated at the top of her class was hired by a law firm not as a lawyer but a secretary.Nowhere in any book or a google search can I find anything that suggests the author has had a rough life. Has had to fight to get where she is. Like some women she seems to have had a good life handed to her. Wish I could read where she faced hardships in getting into law school etc instead I read on various sites about what smooth sailing she has had. She had connections that most women even today do not have so how she can write about average women and what they face is a mystery to me. Like so many Washington insiders she seems isolated from the rest of us.She also writes about Title 9 which has helped a lot of young women get into sports. She seems to not know or ignores the fact that young women who are active in sports, also are less likely to use drugs or partake in sexual activity. How about cheering this aspect of Title nine?Now I do agree big time that women who choose to stay at home and raise a family are often looked down on. But in my opinion I think they are looked down on by both liberal and conservative women in power who work outside the home. Women who talk about a world they know little about firsthand.But the book is interesting reading."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"In making a great new contribution to the refutation of radical politics, Kate does us all, men and women, a favor. The Feminist Movement has moved on a parallel path with all of the other single interest protest groups over the last century; those which have comprised the whirling planets in the orbit of radical-left causes the end game of which is world wide socialism concommitant with its overthrow of capitalism.Go down the list - radical environmentalism, federally subsidized abortion, class warfare racial-victimology politics and its portent for the selected grievances of approved victims, the teaching and elevation of Marxism as a societal governing system of choice, hate crimes, anti-coporatism ne anti-global free trade, academic speech codes and its anti-free speech methods including the systematic shouting down of conservative commentators and speakers, anti-wealth building welfare politics and the redistribution of incomes, pro-child and anti-parent anti-marriage laws, anti-christianity and pro-secular Communism, an anti-war agenda except where the political left approves, a hugely biased left-wing media, Communist supporting liberation theology in protestant churches - a weird merging of Jesus and Marx, and so on and so on. The reason for all of the latest shrillness of the George Soros funded move-on type of groups is that the visions of their annointed ones are not proving out. Witness the continuing airing of the left's errant conclusions on media outlets no longer controlled by the political left, the result of the micro-chip driven, information revolution. They've lost their one-way megaphone where they talk and you listen (one Orwellian to the max), and they're hopping mad and afraid.Kate O'Bierne has taken every axiom of the Feminist Left and proved its untruth. She along with others like Myrna Blyth, Michelle Malkin, Ann Coulter, Debbie Schlussel, Tammy Bruce, and Camille Paglia, are all very much pro-women's advancement, but fiercly anti-Marxist while respectful of the role of males in society. It would be repetitive to list yet again the long list of all the problems Kate has with the radical-feminist-left so I'll leave that up to you, the reader, to explore. Needless to say, the left's conclusions go against all intuition for any open minded human not living in a closet for the last 30 years.To summarize, Kate allows that the feminist agenda has been more harmful than helpful to women. In fact, this book is just the tonic for anyone looking for what one would describe as a common sense analysis. That said, there is much emotion that passes for reason in the common reasoning of most of us, and all to often we reach a conclusion before looking backwards for facts which will support it. Any facts that don't are conveniently left out of our summary conclusions.Looking back over the last 200-plus years, it was easy for seemingly intelligent men (and women) to speak of or write about theories which later proved wildly off base - try Malthus, but since the age of the micro-processor and Moore's law the statistical facts can be number crunched to prove their validation (or not) of various societal policies - think aid to dependent children and international aid and the efficacy of their underlying assumptions.This main-frame driven era began in the late-60's, and the jury is now in: left-wng ideas don't improve society for the betterment of all, they make it worse. Hence, we now have less faith in Keynesian economics and more faith in those of Milton Friedman. And so it goes.The Democratic Party, taken over by the radical left in 1972 during the McGovern campaign, has finally lost control of the Federal Legislature, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court plus a majority of the State govenorships. While they still control the Federal bureaucracy, that death-grip will also diminsh as more erudite individuals like Kate O'Bierne continue to pound home the message of their underlying fallacies.This is an instructive book for those not already disabused of left-wing, radical-Feminist notions. If you're one of the latter and a free thinker you'll enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"O'Beirne pulls no punches and takes no prisoners in her damning indictment of modern feminists.

They insist that any sex differences are the result of social construction, not biology.Many of these women are public figures who use their notoriety in acting, pop music, journalism, and politics to spout unfounded bad ideas and harebrained schemes.

No one can \\"do it all\\" or \\"have it all\\". My industry has bent over backwards to promote women and minorities and reward them economically to the point that being a white male was an obstacle. Because of that, a lot of unqualified or mediocre individuals have been put in positions they can't handle.

I believed that waiting until after 30 was fine for having children, husbands were optional, and a shiny BMW would make it all better. Thank God I was enlightened shortly before my narrow-mindedness cost me the biggest price of all. I now have a beautiful 3 year-old and a wonderful, caring husband on my team. I work AND take care of my child full-time (yes, it's possible) while my husband attends dental school. We couldn't be happier. This book should be required reading for all 18-year-olds. I don't share the author's contempt for the feminists listed in the book because I do believe that most of them really believe that what they preach will help our young women. I was one of them (almost) and I understand how they could mistake children & marriage as obstacles to achievement, whether it be career-oriented or some kind of personal freedom. Ironically, in their quest to give women absolute liberty, they forgot that CHOICE is the ultimate freedom. Unfortunately, this book and others didn't come in time for all of my unmarried, childless friends who now desperately regret the decisions that they made. One such friend called me two years ago and cried as she admitted the guilt she felt for wanting to submit to the \\"overwhelming need to just marry and have children\\". As natural as that may sound to some of you, the young women of my generation were (and are) indoctrinated to look down on those women who chose family first. We were taught that those women chose that route because they were not as smart or determined or strong. We were taught that those women who were educated were wasting their talents by staying at home. Thank you, O'Beirne, for saying what so few have the nerve to say and thank you for saying it so well.- Freedom's Song -They had known each other all their lives...at least all they remembered of their lives. Years ago, they had perched beside one another in the pet store, sharing moments of understanding amid the noise and fears of unknown futures. They had always been there for each other. Especially since that autumn day she came, paid her money and took them home.Oh, how they longed to be free! Fluttering forlornly in their cage, they would see birds soaring high into the sky. Birds who resembled them in every way but one...freedom. Free to be who they were meant to be. Free to fly.The plan began as a small seed of an idea, a glimmering in the eye, a key unlocking the door to hope. Why not? Why not escape? What was holding them back? A few bars on a cage, free food and comfort, the seduction of security. One day, they reasoned, she will forget. She'll walk away leaving our cage door ajar, and free we'll fly. Out the room. Out a window or door. Free, finally free!And so they waited...watching, hoping, trusting. Not knowing when they awoke if this night they would sleep high in the sheltering arms of a tree. Would today be the day? Would the magic finally happen? Would their dream come true? This hunger for freedom consumed their lives. They ate little and sang less. It was as if their throats were blocked by the bile of desire.Until the day came, dawning bright and clear. The day of their deliverance.After filling their seed and water, the woman left the room...cage door unlatched, unscreened window open to Indian summer's warmth. And they bolted! But weakened by hunger and untried wings, they plunged to the floor. Outside the window, beckoning voices sang, \\"Fly! Fly, dear friends. Fly free!\\"First one, then the other stretched and flapped, flapped and stretched. Until slowly, slowly they began to rise. One to the window, the other to the cage. While one flew free, the other went back home.She often asked herself why she had not escaped with her friend, and the answer was strange. It was only in the choosing that she knew herself to be already free.And she began to eat again and to sing. Her song became so poignantly beautiful, birds frequently perched outside her window to listen. She spoke to their hearts. And her companion? The one who had followed her dream? She stayed close to the house, often hungry and afraid, listening at the window to her sister's song.The other birds encouraged her to join them as they prepared to migrate south, but she couldn't bear to leave. It was as if she had carried her cage with her.And the wind whispered in the trees, \\"Who is free? Who is free? Who is truly free?\\""},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"A fast-paced and great read! Kate OBeirne compiles and organizes in a logical manner many of the most illogical, frustratingly stupid, hair-raising, obnoxious, non-sensical, absurd and outright evil decisions and actions promulgated by a variety of women, women's organizations, and intimidated governmental or private groups who respond to such wags.Many of these women obviously think they are righteous and progressive and in reality are anything but. Mostly they have succumbed to expedient, \\"popular\\", or depraved ideals which have provided a formula for destruction of women, men and the family as an preferred, optimal functioning unit and the cornerstone of our society.Kate O'Beirne takes on these women-many who are considered \\"popular\\", powermongers, acclaimed icons and sacred cows (intended) by the press and contemporary society-and I believe she has shown extreme bravery in doing so, yet she remains a lady throughout the process. This is a watershed book-not because she reveals many previously unknown acts-but because she brings an acute awareness of how much we as a society have already lost as a result of the zeal, guile and craftiness of women whose actions have made the world worse-while their rhetoric states that their actions are intended to make life better for women. The feminists have succeeded in their goals, and we are now well on our way to seeing the destruction of traditional values and families.O'Bearne did not write this book without realizing she would become a target. She has always been treated with respect-or with at least tacit regard for her intelligence-by many of the feminists she discusses. Alas, I would say, no more-they will sink their fangs into her. Her book is a brave and lucid statement and her revelations come at a time when as a society we should be weary of double-speak, and ready to look truthfully at how the women's movement has already damaged several generations.

For readers who have not lived through events such as Tailhook, Title IX, and feminist misdirection and false data amplified by media hype, this is a good way to understand the ripples that sometimes turn into unwanted tsunamis. It's extremely noteworthy that the original \\"feminists\\" around the turn of the century viewed abortion as \\"the ultimate exploitation of women\\". It's also interesting to see how feminists got hysterical over Lawrence Summers words in 2005, but now that he's a member of President Obama's administration, he's a genius. Of course the Clinton episode with Monica Lewinski had nothing to do with sexual intimidation in the workplace by a supervisor!!! There are some humorous events, like Maxine Waters explaining that, \\"I have to march because my mother could not have an abortion\\" or when MIT professor Nancy Hopkins explained that, \\"I would have blacked out or thrown up\\" when Lawrence Summers suggested that there might be differences in males and females, thereby confirming an innate difference, or the projection that \\"the last male to earn a bachelor's degree will walk across the stage at final ceremonies in 2144\\".

It makes a victim out of every female, brings about an element of barbarism to our daily relations, and has conjured up a war between the sexes.Considering that the media constantly refers to the main feminist organizations as \\"women's groups\\" and that pusillanimous politicians pretend that these leftist extremists are representative of the average woman, it is not surprising that there has been such a frenzied response to the publication of Kate O'Beirne's book. With O'Beirne's masterful detailing of the feminist defilement of both human dignity and culture in general along with her pervasive use of logic-the feminist kryptonite-perhaps hysteria was the only way in which activists thought they could keep the general public from discovering the true extent of their contempt for the citizenry.In these pages, the incompetence and inferiority of the feminist mind is readily evident to the reader as O'Beirne gives us a comprehensive tour of their advocacy and opinion. The Equal Rights Amendment is revealed to be a legal absurdity as its vagueness, should it have passed, would have ensured either tyranny or meaninglessness. The egregious Violence Against Women Act (1994) was designed not to protect women, but, rather, to guarantee female supremacy by elevating them in the eyes of the law. Measures like the Equity Pay Act were proposed to allow women to be highly paid for work which matches their personal interests while ignoring the need of consumers. That the root of radical feminism is actually an attempt to procure jobs for the unemployable is a perspective I had never thought of, but it is extensively-and devastatingly-developed here by the author.The text lives up to its secondary billing by carefully explaining in individual chapters the way in which feminists have denigrated the family, the armed forces, every form of education, and sports. I figured that my favorite chapter would be \\"Mother Nature's a B-tch,\\" but it wasn't because the introduction, albeit quite short, dismantled the jaggedy bricks of this Jacobinism as if they were stones atop Monte Cassino.Perhaps the best reason for the left's outraged reaction to this text is that it exposes the totalitarian foundations of political correctness, an ideology of which feminism is irrefutably a subset. PC has eroded the value of a university education due to its outlawing the search for truth. Indeed, as one psychologist O'Beirne cited remarked concerning daycare: \\"Psychologists must refuse to undertake any more research that looks for the negative consequences of other-than-mother care.\\" Why? Well, the outcomes might not be favorable to the points of view of today's politicized pseudo-scholars, so the findings must be buried when they don't meet the demands of theory.Radical feminism, with its Manichean outlook and attempt to subjugate men in the name of equality, is a malignant and vile influence upon our society. We should all be thankful that Kate O'Beirne has the courage needed to stand up to these fanatics. It is now time for all of us to stare down these vindictive bullies and prevent them from ruining the lives of any more people than they already have."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Please don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"First of all, this book is not designed to persuade the indecisive, thought in a secondary sense it does accomplish this. Its primary function is to sharpen the argument of the True Believers.As I read this book, I kept thinking of Ayn Rand's dictum \\"A=A.\\" Women have distinct and obvious differences that feminists deny-or half-deny. That is the feminists want equality, but on an unequal basis. They want women to retain corporate seniority, while taking off time to rear children. They are trying to have their cake and eat it, too-(Ayn Rand again.)Two key chapters are \\"In the classroom . . . Boys will be Girls\\" and \\"G. I Janes.\\" The feminist movement is trying to masculinize women and feminize men. The practical result is that men are, by state fiat, marginalized, and women are being put at risk in firefights by having lower standards. This is exactly what the Enemy and the terrorists want.The crucial chapter is the last one, where O'Beirne lays the metaphysical case for differences between men and woman. The essence of the chapter can be distilled to the discussion on public toilets:\\"In 2005 Olga Gershenson of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Barbara Penner of University College in London invited contributions for the collection they were editing entitled Toilet Papers: The Gendered Construction of Public Toilets. This feminist scholarship \`will work from the premise that public toilets, far from being banal or simply functional, are highly charged spaces, shaped by notions of propriety, hygiene and the binary gender division.' They point out that \`public toilets are among the very few openly segregated spaces in contemporary Western culture,' and so \`provide a fertile ground for critical work interrogating how conventional assumptions about the body, sexuality, privacy, and technology can be formed in public space and inscribed through design.'\\"\\"If even the biological imperative to, ahem, either stand or sit is seen as an example of the repressive \`gender division' and a result of \`conventional assumptions' about sex differences, it's little wonder that feminists reject the convincing evidence about the less immediately obvious differences in male and female anatomy, beginning with the brain.\\" (193)Exactly!On avenue that O'Beirne does not pursue is the male's \\"superior systemizing skills\\" (196). She suggests that the male's facility \\"for understanding and building systems\\" makes them hard-wired to be \\"good scientists, engineers, architects, electricians, bankers, and toolmakers.\\" (192,196).One system that O'Beirne does not mention is philosophy. C. S. Lewis noted that \\"the proper glory of the masculine mind [is] its disinterested concern with truth for truth's own sake, with the cosmic and the metaphysical, is being impaired.\\" (Present Concerns, 51). The best example of thy systemizing, organizing, and philosophizing skill is Thomas Aquinas's \\"Summa Theoloigca.\\" Ayn Rand's philosophy was posthumously systemized and organized by Dr. Leonard Peikoff.This is crucial, since ideas carry consequences. If males, in then general, have better systemizing skills, then the feminists would take heed to their alternative voice."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"After reading Kate's book, I can well understand the fear, terror & hatred coming from the feminists & liberals who have left (pun intended) such nasty (but dare I say signature?) responses. The cat is out of the bag & she isn't going back in! The typical liberal collective is to shout down whomever they can't intellectually or morally debate. Facts are facts, truth IS truth & that's a tough pill to swallow for those who have to restort to lies & distortions to sell a faulty, dangerous & destructive agenda of feminism. This is a well written, informative & well researched book based entirely on fact & truth. [...] I highly recommend this to everyone male or female, liberal or conservative though the males may have some difficulty reading the material or understanding the numbers given the war against them in the school system (via the feminist movement) thus seeing their reading skills in serious decline! There, maybe that will appease the feminists if I have one negative male comment in my review! :O) Doubtful though!"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This is an good book with analysis that will give you a lot to think about. It is just as valuable to men as women. However, based on the types of reviews it is getting it is clear that many people are giving this book a poor rating based on their own agendas. It is clear that many reviewers have never even read the book and some who claim to have read it apparently have not. Perhaps it is time for Amazon to limit reviews to people who have actually ordered the book through Amazon."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This is a great book it shows an easy to follow depiction of how the left has degraded society."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"[...]I ordered a copy. Mrs. O'Beirne has written a masterful expose of the feminist movement in America. I started the book the day it arrived and didn't put it down until I finished it. There was fire aplenty. Bravo, Mrs. O'Beirne, you have totally destroyed any leanings and support that I had held for the feminist movement.[...]"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This is a spot-on, politically incorrect analysis of the various assertions of the Feminist Left.

You remember the 50s, don't you? When women were supposed to be 'barefoot and pregnant' and 'seen but not heard.' When the men controlled everything, including all the money. When husbands disciplined the wife as well as the children. When adults sexually and physically abused children with impunity. When bloody backroom abortions killed scores of women. When rape was not considered a real crime because \\"even when a women says No she means Yes\\" - so of course rape was the woman's fault.Boy, sure wish we could go back to those 'innocent' good old days! Don't you?Never mind that the rightwing cabal has done so much damage to the economy and the middle class quality of life that no family can exist on one income and women MUST work full-time just to keep a roof over their families' heads and food on their tables - and don't even get me started on health care!But no, Ms O'Beirne thinks she has the right to tell women (who are citizens of this country, who pay their taxes, who work hard for a living) what they should and should not do and how they should and should not do it!Feminism is NOT radical. It is NORMAL. Ms O'Beirne is RADICAL. And hateful. And not what I would consider a decent woman. She is an ugly, hateful shill.I expect her next book to be titled, \\"African Americans who Dare to Expect the Same Rights as We Whites - and How We Can Put them Back in their Place - for the Good of America.\\"I'm NOT kidding!"},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Kate O'Beirne has given readers an insight into what Feminism is actually doing to our culture. In a word, ruining it. There are no hateful diatribes or attacks on the feminist leaders in this country, there is just example after example of how feminism is malevolently affecting our schools, our military, our sports, and our marriages. Feminism has eroded and overcome the facts of biology. Men and women are different, biologically, emotionally, physically, and those differences should be celebrated not exterminated. Ms. O'Beirne herself is a testament to what a modern day woman should be; she is confident, intelligent and ambitious but also is family-oriented and proud of her role as a woman and all that may entail. This book is an honest look at feminism's effect on this Country. If anyone is interested in this topic, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"This book is very straightforward and very clear. My daughters and I have all enjoyed it. The current generation of young women is at best confused but more often repelled by the current feminist leadership. Where is the commitment to truth? Feminism is saddled with too much ideology and can no longer connect to reality. This book makes its case."},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","review":"Very interesting book, even from a male point of view. Just a reminder to all people looking to buy this book. If you see a 1 or 2 star rating, than most likely the crappy rating comes from a hysterical liberal feminist who has their panties in a wad. Because you see Liberals get angry and hysterical when you can actually tell the truth about them. Pretty sad in this day and age of freedom of speech and \\"tolerance\\" that liberals have stooped to bashing the review of a book on amazon.com. Sounds to me like Liberalism is the new Fascism/Communism.
