The characters are so real that by the time I finished this book they were all like friends. While reading it I laughed and I cried, never before has one novel made me do both.My 84 year old Nan read this and loved it, my 58 year old Dad read this and loved it so when it was passed on to me, at the time an 18 year old, I did not expect to get beyond the end of chapter one. Three days later as I closed the book I was sorry it was over.This book is fantastic. The UK paperback edition is 1016 pages long and yet it felt as though it was over in no time. I have read this book twice and that is not something I have done with many of the thousands of books I have read. I would recommend that anyone who likes to read, read this book. You'll have a wonderful time and make some new friends along the way."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This was the first book by Pilcher I ever read. Strangely, I have very mixed feelings about this book. Pilcher fans will certainly love it. The author does a wonderful job to get you acquainted with her characters. By the end, I truly felt that I had personally met all the characters in this book. It felt as though I had made new friends. I will likely never forget Judith, the heroine, and all the many people she meets during those years described in the book. Pilcher's way of describing (often in excruciating detail) every scene, room, mood, the weather, clothes, food, etc. allowed me to actually be right there with her characters. In that sense, this novel will stay with me forever. On the other hand, Pilcher seems to struggle somewhat when attempting to describe her characters' feelings and thoughts. Often, I was unsure why a character behaved a certain way and why he or she felt a certain way about others. Pilcher does a great job describing the war years from the British perspective. I really felt like I was living these horrible war years with them. I often felt tempted to make myself a nice cup of tea because tea seems to be the British answer to everything (loss, grief, joy, relaxation, etc.). However, there were points in this novel where I played with the thought of abandoning it. Too little seemed to happen to justify the pages and pages of text. But this I could not do. I felt compelled to wait it out with Judith and the others and see what life (or Pilcher) had in store for them. That is why I was so disappointed in the end. It seemed as though Ms. Pilcher finally got bored with her characters and abruptly felt the need to just bring it all to a conclusion. After all the heartbreak, longing, joys, losses and disappointments, the end seemed irritatingly flat. Too bad, I wish I could have felt rewarded for sticking it out with Judith and her friends. Read this if you have a lot of free time and are a very patient reader. You will fall in love with Judith, her family, the Carey-Lewis family and all the others. Once you're done, you will feel as though you made new friends. You may be disappointed in the conclusion and your patience will be tried along the way but, maybe, getting to know these characters will make it all worthwhile for you. Oh, and don't be surprised if you develop the habit of drinking tea instead of coffe and if you find yourself booking a vacation to the English seashore."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I had read this book a few years ago, but decided to check it out from my library last Saturday before a snowstorm arrived. What a great book to be snowed in with.In addition to being a good love story involving several couples, it is a great book on life as it was before and during WW II in Great Britain. The hardships the people endured are told in great, and sometimes amusing, detail. No matter how bad things become people just carry on. A good cup of tea seems the answer to everything! Descriptions of food and houses are thorough.I would hope that younger women would read this for the historical value. It is a way of life that will never return."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I've read the book 3 times, so I must find it worthwhile. Some very good characterizations: Judith, Gus, Jess and some very interesting relationships that I wish had been developed more fully. Unfortunately, there were some central casting characters as well: Diana is straight out of a 1930's MGM movie. But many of the scenes Pilcher writes (especially Judith's reunions with Jess and Gus) seem true to life and that's what you'll remember. My I recommend Elizabeth Jane Howard's Cazalet Chronicles to any of you who liked this book? Starting with &quot;The Light Years&quot;, this series of 4 books tells the story of an English family from 1938 to 1947. An excellent work!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I first read &quot;Shell Seekers&quot; and have been reading everything she writes ever since. &quot;Coming Home&quot; is a beautifully written look back at the time just before WW2, during and after. Living in America we sometimes don\`t realize what the English endured for such a long time. Pilcher makes you live all the joy and sadness her characters go through. The second reading was just as satisfying as the first."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Oh wow! This is such a delightful book and I just adored every word. Coming Home is the first Pilcher novel I have read and I will be reading lots more! This book tells such a compelling, wonderful story that it is a very quick read. Pilcher's attention to detail allows her readers to really experience the story, not just read it. Take it on your next vacation and dive into Pilcher's tale of a young girl's coming of age in misty Cornwall, England."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I try to save my 5 stars for truly spectacular books and this is one of them! I received the hardback as a gift a couple of Christmases ago &amp; it seemed such a waste at the time. Rarely do I find a book so compelling that I would want to pay four times the paperback price when, chances are, I won't read it more than once before I pass it off to a friend down the road. This, however, is a book that I will definitely be keeping on my bookshelf! I have always been interested in the 1930s &amp; 40s and this novel gave me a great glimpse at the past. This is by far Rosamunde Pilcher's best novel. I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"After purchasing the hardbound volume at a local book store for $5.99 (yes, hard bound), I felt I couldn't go wrong with the price. I bought the book with the intention of reading it while in the Northeast over Christmas. The setting of the book as well as my physical surroundings gave it a kind of &quot;being there&quot; mystique. I am quite impressed by the text. Curiously enough, my stepmother who grew up in Great Britain during World War II wants to read it as the blackout curtains reminded her of times and people gone by. Excellent job, Rosamund."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"1935 pre-World-War Two England and Judith Dunbar, a 14-year-old British girl, embarks on the long road to adulthood.With parents and baby sister stationed in Singapore, Judith remains in England to attend boarding school, a school which she is not very keen to attend at first, but will change the course of her young life forever.When she makes fast friends with Loveday Carey-Lewis, youngest child of the extremely wealthy Carey-Lewis's of Nancherrow, Judith swiftly becomes emeshed with their luxurious lifestyle, one of which she is not accustomed to, and is enveloped by their glamourous world and its inhabitants.When a torpedo blasts the submarine her young cousin Ned is stationed on, subsequently killing him, the war commences in full force and life for Judith and her family as well as her adopted family, the Carey-Lewis's, dramatically change. Loves are found and lost all too quickly, discoveries regarding those involved in Judith's life are shocking and sorrowful, and Judith's own revelations about her own self and life, will have the reader quickly turning pages amongst fallen tears.This is Rosamund Pilcher's England where you can envision fresh clean laundry hanging from lines, floating in the spring breeze and feel the cold chill your bones during a long Cornish winter, with it's gray wild sea.Her characters will become your friends and truly a part of your life, and when the last page is read and last tear shed, your life will be even more enriched than before you read the book and you will become a Rosamund Pilcher fan for life."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"one can only imagine that you are there in the room eaves-dropping and will be detected. Miss Pilcher has a way about her which draws you in and makes you one with her characters. the only dissapointing thing about this book is that once finished there in no new book of here to read"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Coming Home by Rosamunde Pilcher follows Judith Dunbar for ten years before and during World War II in England. The book begins with fourteen year old Judith being left at Boarding school in Cornwall while her mother and sister join her father in Singapore. Judith soon makes friends with Loveday Carey-Lewis and is swept into her family and their eccentric privileged life. Judith grows from a timid young girl to a woman and faces love and loss, joy and tragedy.I've been in a mood lately where I hate everything so I decided to go back and read a book that I adored when I was a teen and see what I thought of it now. This is a huge book ringing in at around a thousand pages and encompassing ten years of Judith's life. The book tends to be overly descriptive (an abridged copy would have been terrific) and reads slow at times however Judith and the Carey-Lewis clan is so compelling and their lives are so romantic and tragic that it keeps the reader interested. I found myself drawn into the time period and into Cornwall. Falling in love when she did and crying when her heart was broken."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"My wife is an avid reader of historical fiction and a devotee of Rosamond Pilcher. It is her opinion that \\"Coming Home\\" is Pilcher's best effort and returns to it on occasion. After her last reading the book was so warn that when she came to the end the back cover and last page were missing. Not a satisfying ending! I purchased a fresh used copy for her for Christmas. I might even read it!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"When you start reading this book, you want to please - - be that person,BE there, be in that house, with that family, know the Carey-Lewis family.So descriptive, very addicting, love the story.Thank you Rosamunde Pilcher !"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I recently purchased a new paperback copy of this book as I had worn my first paperback copy to shreds! I love this title. I had already read most of Rosamund Pilcher's titles before this one first came out. I saw it on a 20% off sale at the local Target at Christmas time in 1995, and bought it immediately. I was so pleased to have it, and it has proven to be a book that still enraptures me. It never bores or frustrates. The television program that evolved from it did not suit me. If it did not suit you and you have not read the book, please do. Rosamund Pilcher's grasp of the English language will entrance you.I reread it about 6 times a year, and lately I have noticed that it is a novel for life changes: divorce, friendship breakups, physical moves, personal triumphs, recovery from life-threatening illnesses. I am now reading the novel for the second time inside one month; only this time, I am reading the brand new paperback copy that I just bought from Amazon. I read the old copy while I was packing to move toward the middle of August 2010. I am rereading it again as I unpack here in my new apartment here in September 2010. Hopefully, this copy will last a long as the first one I had did - packing tape notwithstanding!One of the aspects of the novel that I so love are the continuancies of the various relationships. In a current age of friendships going by the wayside, and the inherent lack of ethics everywhere, this novel is about relationships which continue throughout life...creative, ethical, loving, wonderful people in the middle of growing up during WW II who stand by each other in a heart-warming way! If you have not read this book, you might want to start. It will help see you through everything!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This book is simply wonderful from beginning to end and I think it is one of Rosamunde Pilcher's best. I read this book many many years ago and have gone back to read it a few more times. It's one of those novels that is perfect to read on a rainy day with a cup of something hot and soothing. The settings are described in such vivid and descriptive language that you almost feel like you are there. The characters are well developed, warm, and engaging and you can't help but want to continue reading about what happens next in their lives. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"That's my opinion of course. Coming Home is such a wonderful novel - even inspiring. I very much want to visit Cornwall after reading this book as well as \\"The Shell Seekers\\". Many people believe the aforementioned book is Pilcher's finest and indeed it's very well done; however, this book goes into such detail (I love it) that it actually brings the reader into the feel of the times (1935-45). The heroine, Judith Dunbar, is such a good person that you'd love to meet her (or at least I would). She's honest, caring, beautiful (although I don't overly done), is a good friend and she loves her family. This book is not without sorrows - I don't want to write about them as to give them away but they feel \\"right\\" for the story. I even love how thick the novel is - my only regret is that it wasn't available in kindle but it's fun every once in a while to hold a book as opposed to an iPad or Kindle."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK I HAD READ PART ONE AGES AGO AND WAS WRAPT THAT I COULD FINISH PART TWO,THE STORY WAS SAD AND ALSO FUNNY IN PLACES.FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END AND REAL PAGE TURNER."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"When looking at the cover of this novel I had no idea that I, being male, would ever enjoy this story. Boy was I wrong. I fell in love with the characters and the setting of this timeless piece of art. I sometimes consider myself a literary snob and was looking for something completely different to read. I now rank this book right up there as one of the most absorbing and emotional reads I have come across in a long while. For a previous reviewer who wrote this is poorly written, I would beg to differ. The prose and the dialogue are well scripted and structered. Coming Home is a feast and a delight which i shall not soon forget. I'm looking forward to the day I re-read this blessing of a novel and rejoin the colorful cast of characters who made me proud, laugh, and, embaressingly enough, at times brought tears to my eyes. I wanted to jump right into the novel and join this cast, especially the heroine which pleasantly was a strong, mature, and oh so good hearted female we follow from child to adult as one is taken on her incredible journey. If Jayne Eyre had been a happy book this may have been her story."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This was right up there with the Shell Seekers as one of this author's best--I had difficulty putting it down!!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Great author, but book came up under search for LARGE PRINT books......It is not Large Print! Amazon needs to fix this in how they present items."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I read this book several years ago and wanted to keep it in my collection on my Kindle. Rosamund Pilcher writes easy to read stories and this is no exception.I have given my hard copy to so many people to read and they all loved the story.It is about a young girl who is left in the care of her Grandmother, just prior to WW2. Her mother, father( who is in the army) and little sister are in Singapore. It tells the story of her life in the UK, her school days and her life after the war.If you are a Rosamund Pilcher fan you will love this one. AAAAA++++ in my book"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I read the book 4 times and watched the two movies \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Nancherrow\\" a dozen times and the changes between the novel and the movies are minor and definitely improve the quality of the movies.Also I enjoyed the WW II news reels that are shown at the beginning of each new year...here the movie offers more than the novel possibly can. Books/words have limitations (and so do have films, on the other hand).Another praise I would like to give to the very beautiful Cornwall locations. Although authors like Mrs. Pilcher and Daphne DuMaurier have described Cornwall in unforgettable ways, nothing can exceed seeing (instead of reading) the Cornwall landscape and scenery. Thank God that both movies have been filmed in Cornwall (and let me tell you, Cornwall is as beautiful in real life as it is in the movies...I've just been there).BTW I never got the impression that Heather Warren or the former servant of Judith's mother were major characters who caused important changes in the novel, so I was fine when they were skipped in the movie. And it's really not so earth-shattering to me if the butler is called Nettlebed or Dobbs, it just doesn't matter at all nor does it help to improve the plot.Also I must admit that towards the end of the book I always skip those 143 pages that Judith spends in Colombo or Singapore (?), because it's the only boring part of the book and very slooow. Not much happening during those months that she spends in Asia. Fortunately the movie director was smart enough to recognize this, too, and skipped it entirely. Good!What really matters however is the friendship between Judith and Loveday...and the wonderful relationship between Diana Carey Lewis and the Colonel (Peter O'Toole) and between Diana and her children...who would not want to have such a mother?And this friendship was the very essence/spirit for me when I read the book which I found to my delight even more compelling in the movie.Gorgeous and outstanding TV adaptation and worthy of 10 stars at least.I wonder if the audio book version from \\"Coming Home\\" has more than 24 audio CD's? Can anybody tell me? I want it unabridged, not the 6 audio CD version that they offer in Germany.For instance Nelson DeMille's novel \\"Spencerville\\" has less than 700 pages, but takes up 19 audio CD's. So I assume 1100 pages from \\"Coming Home\\" would be more like 25 or 26 audio CD's. Unfortunately amazon.com and amazon.co.uk both don't give this information.If you enjoyed watching \\"Coming Home\\", don't miss watching the equally good sequel \\"Nancherrow\\". It's not based on a novel by Mrs. Pilcher, it's just based on her characters from \\"Coming Home\\", but am I awfully glad that somebody wrote a sequel screen play. And if there would be a part 3, I would surely watch that one as well!If you enjoyed reading \\"Coming Home\\", you will also love \\"A Peculiar Chemistry\\" by Kitty Ray, one of the best British books I ever read and also partly taking place in WW II. A keeper!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"It pains me to say this, but I thought that Coming Home was one of the most predictable books that I have ever read. I usually love Pilcher's stuff, so I ran out and bought the hardback of this book thinking that it would not dissappoint. I was mistaken. It started out with promise, but fell flat at parts when it could have really speeded things up. I found myself very bored and tired of the characters and their trivial problems. Boo,hoo. Poor me. This is what ran through my mind as I read this book. Don't waste the money or the time reading it. Read Shell Seakers again. It is by far a more profound and involving book"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. An interesting cast of lovable people are intertwined within the words. Each scenario is in its own way beautiful, and the overall storyline is one to be remebered."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I read this book years ago and loved it. I have lost my copy, and now that I have a Kindle decided to see if I could download it. Well, I was very disappointed to discover that this book is not available to U.S. customers. In fact, it seems there is only one of Pilcher's books available for download in the U.S. Why is that?"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This book is exciting. Chronicling the life of Judith Dunbar, a young teenage girl in the 1930s, she gets caught up in a family, friends, and ultimately a nation going to war. I could see the bombed out London, feel the Cornish countryside. This book will take you in and make you forget where you are--you will be returned to your reality with a \\"thunk\\"--weren't you just standing looking at the Cornish ocean?The best I've yet read by Pilcher. A masterpiece of characterization. Fall in love with the charming and realistic people that help Judith find that \\"Coming Home\\" is the most wonderful thing of all."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I could not put this book down once I started reading it. Sheer enjoyment and makes me want to go out and buy all of Rosmund Pilcher's books.One thing I enjoyed was the time span of the book that made it much more interesting that one particular period in time. Great writing, great personalities and great ending...Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Yes, it was a delightful story, I couldn't put it down I didn't want it to end. I have to say the only one thing that I wish Mrs. Pilcher would of done different is maybe to add 25 more pages and talked about Judith and Jeremy, after all she went through in the 10 years that the story takes place she well deserved and we the readers deserved to be part of her happiness. I sure hope there would be continuation to this absolutely wonderful story."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I really got into the book after the first couple of chapters where Pilcher sets her tone of the story. I enjoyed the characters very very much, and could follow Judith Dunbar, the young girl, as she experiences many events starting through her life at the boarding school, and beyond. As always with Pilcher, she describes the emotions very well, as though the characters at one time reaslly exsisted and experienced these events back in the time of the Depression. I think it is a GREAT read, and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone craving a good family saga!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I have never been disappointed in a Pilcher book and this is no exception. Reading her books is like curling up in front of a fire on a cold day with a cup of cocoa and warm chocolate chip cookies. You will love this book and wish it would never end."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is one of those books full of lucious imagery and descriptions that made this reader want to hug herself with delight in savoring every well-chosen word. Pilcher's word pictures are so vivid and original. She's got a great story-line too, but COMING HOME was most memorable for me in the power of her word choices."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Brilliantly written. I'm not a fiction reader and don't like romance novels. However, I'm totally hooked on Rosamunde Pilcher now and have read three of her masterful books within the past two weeks. Coming Home is my favorite because of its epic nature and historical background. I didn't want the captivating story to end, despite sadness felt about the demise of a gentler, more civilized era."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I too read Shell Seekers first and I was also hooked to Rosumund Pilcher. &quot;Coming Home&quot; is a once in life time discovery. This book was nearly impossible to put down because of the insight Pilcher gave in each of the characters lives. I couldn't wait to find out about everyone in this book. Each character was well rounded and felt like an well known friend. Pilcher description of England during WWII left me feeling as if I was actually there. It was horrific and realistic all wrapped up into on large novel."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Whether you belong to the WWII generation, or are a Gen-Xer, you will love this book. There is history and romance, but what stands out in my mind the most about this book is the dialogue, utterly british, sometimes funny, and always revealing. The main characters are so real that you feel like you know them by the time it is over. I have read it twice in 4 years and each time I have finished I have cried my eyes out, sorry that it had to end."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I am a 16 year-old italian girl.

I look forward to reading more from her"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"if only coming home had not been my first pilcher novel, i would rate it a 10. the visually descriptive writing of pilcher makes me want to be in the bedrooms of diana and judith. their friendships and multi-generational gatherings made me long for the happier days of my own childhood. i see their experiences as essentially universal for many young women coming of age; even in the 90's. (yes 1990's). separation, personal loss, life choices that often come back to haunt us, were described by pilcher in a way that made this reader compare and reflect. although events were predictable, that in itself made for enjoyable reading; just knowing the author would not abandon or betray her reader made me get september, the very same day i finished coming home"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"What a wonderfully satisfying read. This book was impossible to put down. Clearly Ms. Pilcher is the master of character development. The rich descriptiveness of this novel make it a joy to read. Each character brings you home with him/her. I would love to see a sequel"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I bought this book during my first journey to Great Britain. I was mesmerized reading Coming Home because I felt like I was being taken home to England. Her choice of words made clear the visions of the countryside in my mind. I went down memory lane reading of the various locations of London. While reading this book on my flight home, I felt as if I would never leave the enchanted land of Rosamunde Pilcher"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"In a world in which we are daily reminded of the greed, impersonality, unkindness and inhumanity of our fellow man, Ms. Pilcher gives us heroes and heroins in whom we can place hope for a better tomorrow. They are people we know, people who live all around us, waiting to be discovered"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is a very gentle and entertaining book, typical of Ms Pilcher and it really does show how she is a master of this style of writing. We have well drawn and defined characters, beautiful countryside and exotic locations, and the usual measure of heartache, angst and happiness.However if I have a criticism, and it is a very small one, it is that there are occasions where the characters simply don't quite gel in their relationships with each other. The grand passions presented fall just a little short of being as grand as they should be, and the novel is a little sadder because of it. But only a very little sadder - it is a wonderful and lovely book, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I hadn't seen the movie first. The movie was quite different from her book. The specific scenes that I was really interested in reading about were not the same , or not there at all. I love the characters in her books! She has a way of making you live thru them."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is my favorite book ever. By the end of the book, I felt so close to Judith, the main character. Ms. Pilcher does such a beautiful job of following Judith's life, you feel as if you know her. Definitely Rosamunde Pilcher's best."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I am delighted with my purchase.This novel is set pre and post second world war, England. Pilcher writes with knowledge and grittiness but with beautiful discription of scenery and occasion. I have enjoyed every moment I have spent with her characters. The main character, Judith, is a girl who is left in a boarding school by her parents while her father serves in Singapore. While at boarding school she meets a friend and is invited to spend school breaks with the friend's family. Over the years she becomes part of this family and the story proceeds with characters within the family playing a large part in an engaging story of loss, love and human kindness.Judith's parents are lost to concentration camps after the fall of Singapore but her small sister is returned to England in very sorry state. The whole novel discribes the privations of wartime without sentiment but adequately enough for the reader to 'feel' the difficulties imposed.Thanks for your prompt service."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. It's an amazing story about a girl's coming of age during World War II. The friendships and romances in this book are heartfelt and touching, as is the emotion of a family dealing with the pressures of war. It's Pilcher's best, in my opinion, although The Shell Seekers is a close second."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is the first Pilcher book I have read but it certainly won't be the last. The book was long but it never got boring. In fact, I felt like the author left some big gaps in Judith's life, like what happened between her first Easter break with the Carey-Lewis clan and her final year at school? And after Loveday's wedding? I have always been facinated with the WW2 era and I really enjoyed getting this piece of history from the British point of view. There were parts of the book that were a bit predictable, but I think I would have been disappointed if those things hadn't happened. I do wish that the book hadn't ended quite so soon, I would have liked the story of Judith and Jeremy to go a bit further, in fact I wish that Jeremy would have been featured in the entire book a bit more, instead of so much Edward. Actually, the whole Carey-Lewis family got on my nerves after a while, I enjoyed reading about Uncle Bob, Aunt Biddy and Phyllis much more, they were much more real. But this is a book I will definitely read again. I wish there could be a sequel, I would like to know what happened to everyone from 1945-1955."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I read this book back in High School for the first time and have read it at least 5 times since. I just feel as if I identify so much with Judith, though I am unsure why. Her experiences in life, not necessarily with the war, ring true and one can relate to one episode or another in her own life. Of course set against WWII England and the way everyone pulled together for a common cause and actually had a &quot;purpose&quot; in life, brings the whole book together. I guess it is Judith's search for simplicity and beauty in life that makes this book a great read and draws me back again and again."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I can't say enough good things about Judith. By the end of my first reading, I was left wishing the book was double its length. I've reread this book many times, and each time it's still as good as the first. Maybe even better, because I know what to expect. Judith is absolutely the best character Pilcher has ever created. I've read every novel and short story she's ever written, and I can say certainly that Judith is the one who stands out.She begins as a clever and somewhat shy fourteen year old, who is about to be left behind at a boarding school in England. The idea terrifies her, yet she realizes that she will have to stand up and accept her future. She calmly takes over when her mother begins to fall apart in disorganization. She befriends the spoiled yet friendly Loveday, and strikes up a good relationship with the headmistress at her school. Because of her warm good nature, she draws numbers of people to her. Even the wealthy and self-absorbed Carey-Lewis family recognize her qualities, and welcome her openly. She's valued by family, friends and acquaintances, and generally gets along much better than she feared she would without her parents and sister.Judith also shows an amazing strength. When she was chased by the horrible pedophile, Billy, I was nearly in tears while reading. I actually prayed that she would escape him, and this is a total piece of fiction. Pilcher's narration of the event was that good. I could also see Judith's disastrous relationship with Edward coming a mile away. Everybody falls for the handsome blond party boy at some point in life. It was clear that Judith would fall in love, and it was even more clear that Edward would break her heart. It was heart-wrenching to read Edward's last words to Judith, telling her that he made love to her only to help her get over her childhood experience with Billy, and that he did indeed love her, but certainly not in the way she hoped. It was the best advice in the novel when Mary Millyway told her to not get too close to the Carey-Lewises. Judith has her own family, and must remember that however much the C-Ls love her, they are not her family. Judith's life had started to drag a bit, but when her disaster occurred with Edward, and she decided to take Mary's advice and go visit her own family, she sprang right back on track. It was the best decision to make, and it was even more satisfying to see her make it.I could go on for pages describing the tragic and wonderful events of this novel, but it's best to just plain read it. There is no better character in Pilcher's arsenal, and I doubt that anybody who reads this will disagree."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"When I first began to read this novel I thought oh boy this book is so very descriptive I'm never going to get into this, but I pushed on. About half way through I realized had it not been so very descriptive I wouldn't have fell in love with the characters. This was the very first book that I had to set down. It was one particular place in the book that I was so moved I just couldn't read on. Kind of like the place in a movie where you would start crying. Anyway I thought that it was a wonderful book and would recommend."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I listened to the audiotape of this wonderfully descriptive book and thoroughly enjoyed Lynn Redgrave's remarkable narration. She is so good at this! (the only disconcerting thing I found with the tape was the random bursts of overly dramatic music. They seemed so out of place--inserted with no apparent thought given to what was occurring in the narration).That said, I thought this story was lovely, typical Pilcher fare. One can be pretty sure that all the loose ends will be tied up, that the lost will be found and the bad dealt with in a most genteel manner.I always appreciate the period details in Pilcher's writing and this was no different. The reader always learns something when reading her books. She manages to entwine historical facts in with a family story in a seamless fashion.This is the story of Judith Dunbar and in a secondary way, that of Loveday Carey-Lewis, including all of both families (dysfunctional, functional, and in-between!). Covering the years of 1935 (when both girls were 13) through the end of the Second World War, this book was large in scope and in its portrayal of its many interesting characters.Pilcher does a great job of character development - the reader is quite easily able to identify with the characters who populate this book. The genteel British lifestyle, despite the looming war, is lovingly portrayed.I agree with the reviewer who thought a sequel would be interesting."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Okay, it's a very long book. This is a good thing, though, because it gives you a chance to get to know the characters, who are all fascinating and detailed in their own rights.

It really is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"If you enjoyed any of Rosamunde Pilcher's previous works, you will treasure &quot;Coming Home&quot;. Pilcher once again manages to combine literary art with warm, beautiful characters that you can easily open your heart to. Judith is to be admired for her bravery and compassion. The Carey-Lewises's made me laugh, cry, and laugh again. They made you rejoice for Loveday and Gus, and pity Edward. Pilcher creates a family that you feel is your own. I have read this book more times than I can count, yet I will read it again and again."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is my favorite Pilcher novel, liked it even better than the Shell Seekers.

I read my mom's old copy last summer and just HAD to purchase a copy to keep for myself at college. Readers can live the story themselves through the main characters.

Mrs Pilcher is truly a genious in the way she writes. Her way of mesmerizing and totally capturing the reader into the story. I, the reader, having read this novel , hmmm, lets think now, three... no, four times in the last year or so, am having trouble putting the book down eventhough I know what happens.

It was a poorly written, rather boring volume, which I would never have purchased had I done my homework better."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"It's pretty difficult to rate any of Pilcher's books above the Shell Seekers. ... and this one does NOT make it."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Coming Home is one of those books best described as a \\"sprawling saga\\", starring the landscapes of Cornwall England. Coming Home is the story of Judith Dunbar, beginning with her girlhood in the seaside resort of Penmarron in the years before World War 2, her young adulthood during the war, and in its aftermath. The event that changed Judith's life was meeting Loveday Carey-Lewis at a department store kitting up in preparation for St. Ursula's boarding school. Judith has been placed in the care of her aunt after her mother and her sister moved to Singapore to be with her father. Loveday, spoiled and willful, but wild and fun, has special permission to go home on weekends, and she invites Judith to Nancherrow, the family estate. Judith is immediately enfolded into Loveday's warm family life. I wanted to resent the Carey-Lewises with their upper-class advantages, but Pilcher makes it impossible. In contrast with upper-class families as typically portrayed, they are a close family with good communication, physically affectionate and emphatically not snobbish. These advantages let the family adapt well to the harsh circumstances of wartime. Judith and her family moved around a lot, so Judith never associated any one place as the fixed anchor of \\"home\\". Nancherrow becomes that place for her. After reading Coming Home, I was ready to pack up and move to Cornwall, it sounded so idyllic. Palm trees, beaches, and English country estates - what's not to like. There's love and romance too, but Coming Home is more a woman's journey to adulthood than a boy meets girl story. As Judith grows up, she can transition from becoming the receiver of kindness and generosity to being a woman who is able to give to and care for others.If you're an Anglophile with an appetite for big books, you'll enjoy Coming Home. If you like Coming Home, you might want to check out author Mary Wesley. Wesley also draws on her own experiences to write about the wartime period in England in a similar vein."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"After finishing Coming Home by Rosamund Pilcher I told my husband that this book was so charming, so delightful, so very, very British that nothing else could ever compare! I was bereft when I read the last page and for about a month I couldn't settle into any book! It was that good!!I loved the characters of Judith and Loveday and Diana and Aunt Biddy! I love the descriptions of the tables laid for tea, the Dower House that Judith inherited, the farm that was up the hill from Nancharrow where Loveday comes to live as a young adult. I could picture everything perfectly in my mind, and often find myself daydreaming...still...of this book and it's characters.I enjoyed watching the girls grow up from 14 year old teens to twenty something adults and all of their trials and tribulations. The descriptions of the hardships of WWII made me appreciate what my own parents went through as youngsters, as they never talk about it much.I feel that I could never, ever write an adequate review of this book, but if you have the chance, you simply must read it."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher is an inspiring writer. I have loved her books for years and have re-read this title so many times. Every time a character dies, I burst into tears as if I'm reading it for the first time. Judith Dunbar is such a strong character and her life is extraordinary. The Carey-Lewis's are also so well-written, you feel like you've always known them. There is not a page in this book that is not exquisite.

I couldn't help thinking &quot;where is that red pen?&quot; to chop about 200 pages of mind-numbing detail from the script.HOWEVER, Coming Home is a geographic of the heart, not hearth. It challenges definitions of family and class distinctions, and it underscores that home is the place from which we face the world, hopefully surrounded by love, faith and consistent support.This is a great bedside book and worth the time it takes to read!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Judith, Judith, Judith......where and what are you doing now?Just as I will always remember Penelope in Shell Seekers by Ms. Pilcher, Judith Dunbar will remain with me always. Though it is a coming of age story, it is so much more than that...you want and willingly hold hands with the main character as she makes her own way in a war torn world peopled with richly drawn characters from different strata of society. The details of life as presented hold you spellbound and draw you into Judith's world. You can almost feel her heart beating within your own chest. Do yourself a favor, get the book, snuggle up, and relax on this truly wonderful saga. Linda"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I loved this book.

I loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone who truly loves to read."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I read this as a 17-hour audiobook and concluded that the entire tale could be abridged into no more than 17 paragraphs. There is so little dynamic tension in the story that perhaps a better title for this would have been \\"Happily Ever After\\" since this is a long and winding tale of predictable banality. No mystery, no murder, no mayhem. Hints of tragedy and unrequited infatuation are soothed with endless cups of tea. (It makes me wonder if I might have had a better life if I had been a tea drinker instead of coffee.)The visual imagery is pleasant and so are all the characters, pleasant, pleasant, pleasant. The plot is almost entirely devoid of grit or traction. But still pleasant!The reader of this audio edition offers an excellent rendering of the characters and the narrative. Her delivery was what kept me in the book until its end which sadly failed to deliver any catharsis or closure.The title \\"Volume 1\\" suggests sequels which may or may not be as pleasant as this one. I'll never know."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I became a fan with the &quot;shell seekers&quot; and read all her books ever since.I relished every word of Coming home.... and I hope one day to visit Cornwall!!!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"A friend turned me onto Pilcher by loaning me this book some years back. Since that time, I've read all of Pilcher's books, but this remains my favorite. It is an engaging saga, with much of the book covering the course of WWII as well as the after-effects of this war. The story begins with a young woman and follows both her own family and the connections she makes with the family of a boarding school friend. Although the book is more likely to appeal to women, is it not a romance novel. In addition to enjoying the read, I found it to be educational as well--a wonderful historical novel."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I sometimes come down on the side of literary snobbery, and novels with fluffy pink flowers on the cover are ones I carefully avoid.However.I was out in the woods camping, this was the only book to read, and I quickly became riveted by it and ended up reading all weekend rather than enjoying the woods. The setting, WWII in Britain, is a favorite of mine, and the novel had a feeling of one written fifty or sixty years ago, just a terrific story about a girl's coming of age. Stylistically, I was reminded a bit of Daphne DuMaurier, though the treatment of female sexuality was more direct than an older novel might offer.With those offputting flowers on the cover, I initially thought, \\"ack, bad romance,\\" but it wasn't primarily a romance and it was quite good.Now if I could only explain this to worse literary snobs than me and offer them a terrific week's read with this novel.

Why should she? She is mistress of her own estate, and needs no man to support her. She has passionate, intellectual pursuits that a man would only mock. Let the handsome and gallant Lord Nicholas Daventry find his perfect match in the dazzling Countess Lavinia Welham. Caro would not dream of trying to best such a bewitching creatures -- until she finds the voice of reason drowned out by the longings of her heart...What distinguishes Richardson from most Regency authors (and indeed from most romance authors) is the development of the relationship between the two main characters. In this case, Caro and Nicholas are both interesting, well-educated, intelligent people, and the development of their friendship and love is well-written and thoughtful."},{"Title":"The Bluestocking's Dilemma (Signet)","review":"I went into this book thinking it a run of the mill Recency and was delighted to find instead a well-written novel that also happened to be a Recency Romance. The plot was well done, the characters were well drawn and I was quite taken in by the whole. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Bluestocking's Dilemma (Signet)","review":"Lady Caroline Waverly decided as a child that societal rules restricting women to beautiful objects were idiotic and that SHE wasn't going to follow them. Having no parents to influence her otherwise, and blessed with a fortune and a prosperous estate, she could indulge her passion for scholarship and estate management without worrying over much about being condemned as a bluestocking.As a child of 12, she'd inadvertently caught her beautiful cousin Lavinia laughing at a handsome young man's marriage proposal. When the devastated young man caught her eavesdropping, she told him candidly that her cousin was beautiful and charming, but also quite self-centered, and that she cared for no person as much as herself. And although Nicholas Daventry was wealthy and from an aristocratic family, he was a second son and thus quite beneath the touch of a jewel like Lavinia.Realizing it was true, Nicholas went off to war, distinguished himself in battle, and six years later, returned to London as a marquess, after the deaths of his father and older brother. In the meantime, Lavinia, now the Countess of Welham, has been widowed, and the intervening years have given her a mature beauty that once again draws Nicholas to her. He should know better--and he is well aware of the fact that he should--but she draws him like no other, and he is hopeful that marriage and motherhood have matured her in more than just outward appearance.Of course, Caroline looks on with derision, recalling their conversation on the stairs six years ago, and seeing that even a man such as this is putty in the hands of a lovely woman. Nicholas's impression of the grown-up Caroline changes considerably as they become acquainted. At first she's a nonentity and he feels sorry for her being so much less attractive than her cousin. Then he begins to see how she lights up the lives of everyone around her and really has no need to put herself forward in society. The more he sees her--and compares her character with her cousin's--he finds himself wanting to be in her company. And the more he is with her, the more attractive she becomes. (And she's never been unattractive either.)But Nicholas is a man, and his eyes still light up when he sees the ephemeral beauty of Lavinia. And frankly, they are still lighting up around the vampy Lavinia through 75% of the book, even though he is well on his way to falling for Caroline. This bothered me a LOT. As much as he agrees with Caroline that society is shallow, he still holds up Lavinia as a jewel of the ton. Although as time passes he realizes that a beautiful self-serving fribble is not for him, he takes far too long to realize that Caroline IS.How I wish Ms. Richardson had thought to include a scene of Lavinia's chagrin upon discovering she has lost her prey to her bluestocking cousin. Oh, I feel like I deserved that!"},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"I was sent this book some weeks ago and I enjoyed reading at it.

I also was well impressed about the honesty of the writers in describing places in and out as well as their location. Besides limited curfew times, which can turn your visit into a problem if you wish to stay out forward, these are the places to go especially if you plan to spend most of your time visiting the city.

When you fax the institution a request for a reservation, give them your email address so that they can reply to you on email. Most of them seem to have email now, and it's probably cheaper for them to email you back than to fax you.Also, if you have a problem with stairs, be aware that many of these places do not have elevators and your room will likely be on one of the higher floors.

It may be helpful to send faxes during Italian business hours. Some of the convents seem to turn their faxes off during their night-time hours.2. When corresponding with the convents should include your e-mail address. Recently, we've noticed that many of the convents that we fax respond to us by e-mail. This simplifies things.3. Not all convents and monasteries answer faxes promptly. First, an overseas fax may be a significant expense for a non-profit religious organization. Second, if they have no vacancies, they may not respond. We've learned that if we don't get a response to a confirmed fax receipt, we may try once again or follow up by mail. If we still don't get a response, then we move on.

The rooms will be sparsely furnished, the beds will be lumpy, the heating will be sporadic, and the staff will rarely speak English.But for open-minded, budget-constrained, flexible and experienced travelers, it is the only way to go. The rooms will be spotlessly clean, the location will often be exceptional, and the price will always be a fraction of what the hotel down the street is charging.Things may have changed in the past five years, but when we were using this book, few convents accepted credit cards and most answered the phone only around mealtimes (Italian mealtimes). Some were just starting to make and confirm reservations by e-mail, but only in Italian or very broken English. Every convent had a fax machine.Guests who stay at convents should remember where they are and adapt accordingly. Doors are often locked at 10 or 11 p.m. The staff is not available during prayer times. And if you are traveling as a couple, you might be asked if you are married.Now that we're back home in the USA, some of our best memories (and stories) were born in the convents featured in this book.Like the 500-year-old palazzo five blocks from the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, the one with the grand staircase and marble tiles that popped loose every time we walked on them. Or the modern hotel across the street from dock of the ferry that ran up and down the Cinque Terre coast. Or the beautiful palazzo around the corner from one of Rome's busist intersections, two blocks from one of the city's major bus hubs, where we fell asleep to sound of the motorinos (scooters) buzzing by on the street below."},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"I recently returned from a trip to Italy. I stayed in one of the Rome convents referenced in this book and found the accommodations to be exactly as described in the book. The nuns were gracious and helpful and the room was very plain but clean and comfortable. I highly recommend the book for anyone traveling to Italy on a budget.If you are using public transportation I recommend purchasing a detailed street map of Rome to help pinpoint the location of some of the properties referenced in the book."},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"This seems somewhat helpful if one were traveling in Rome or northern Italy. The southern part, where we wish to travel, is totally ignored, with the exception of Sicily.Is this because there are no/few/unusable sites in this area? If so the book should include this information.Also, it appears one needs to speak Italian to visit most of these, which is a helpful rating. There is little information in the book how to proceed if one does not speak Italian.This book is of limited use, and would probably be more helpful to one who already has experience traveling in Italy."},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"The book was an excellent aid in securing reasonably priced accommodations in Rome and several cities to the North. The curfew - the front door being firmly locked at 10 PM - may be a problem for some but not for those who have spent a busy day sightseeing. We found one convent also closed the door during the lunch hour so we had to wait patiently for our check in. The only other negative was that some of the nuns were not terribly knowledgeable regarding operating their \\"hotel\\" and I had to help repair an electric outage.All in all, the book is a great aid in avoiding high-priced hotels."},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"I received the book in a few days and it was signed by the authur. It is a lovely book filled with much needed info. I have stayed at several of the convents that are in the book. The nuns were wonderful and always helpful. This is a book for those travelers who don't need luxury, but want clean basic accommodations. I am using it again to visit other areas in Italy for a 2012 trip. Convents are my 1st choice."},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"The book arrived early, thank you, in perfect condition.However, although I had purchased at an excellent price and therefore should not have been surprised, it was printed in 1999. It followed that the prices in lire were well out of date and it was easier to obtain information on line. The book is useful for recommendations and descriptions of villages, towns and cities. I will follow the advice provided by the authors. Thanks."},{"Title":"Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging","review":"I've had this book for several years and it must be out dated by now.

Ten adorable & different baby animals are all sleeping in a den when a small little mouse says \\" Roll over\\". Each little animal rolls over and out of the soft den to the bottom of a hill under a shady tree until the little mouse is all alone and rolls her or himself down the hill to be with her/his sleeping friends.What is also nice is that as each animal rolls down the hill they do so in ryhme. We are also starting to learn Chinese so we are also counting in Chinese as each animal rolls to the bottom.I don't know how John Butler does it but the baby animals he draws look so soft and fluffy that you can't help but each out and touch the animals hoping to feel each and every adorable animal! and you just can't beat a book that can be either read or sung AND reinforces counting from 10 to 1! Definately worthy of being a 10* book!"},{"Title":"Ten In The Den","review":"I wish this author, John Butler, had been around when I was a toddler. What fun it would have been to learn my numbers with these fun-loving animals. Beautiful art, too.Your youngster will love it!"},{"Title":"Ten In The Den","review":"We found this book at the library and have since purchased it. My preschooler loves this book because it can be sung (I think the original song is 10 in a bed and the little one says roll over). In this book it's the 10 animals with the little mouse telling each one to roll over and they roll out of the den. It's also a great bedtime book because it ends with all the animals falling asleep.The illustrations are absolutely adorable. Each animal is done so well they really look so fluffy and huggable. I am definitely going to purchase this book for gifts especially for children in the 2 to 4 year old range. We read a lot of books at our house but is one of my very favorites!"},{"Title":"Ten In The Den","review":"Last summer I feel in love with the books and artistry of John Butler. He is a gifted story-teller and illustrator of books for the very young. I reviewed Hush, Little Ones back in July (Read my review) and recently While You Were Sleeping (Read my review).\\"Ten In the Den\\" is a large, hardcover picture book that takes young children through counting to ten. Butler has a delightful re-take on \\"there were 10 in the bed and the little one said, 'Roll over, Roll over.\\" Each page is illustrated with a clutch of a variety of critters tucked in the den. Each page has one less because one rolled out (or rather was pushed out by tiny mouse).Butler's illustrations are again beautiful and will entertain and draw the young child's interest. Soft colors and edges of pictures create a lulling that is suited for bedtime or nap-time reading. Of course, it can be read at any time; and I can just hear the giggles as the reader sings along the \\"roll over, roll over\\" as each critter is pushed out of the den.But this time, when the little one (mouse) is left all alone in the den, he is lonely and rolls out to seek his friends who are now outside the den. The book teaches the concept that just because you are crowded, it is not always best to \\"un-crowd\\" your circumstances. Life can be lonely when there is only you.Counting: In this book the reader can engage the young child to count how many are actually in the den and then at the end of the story the child can count to see that all 10 are together again.I encourage the purchase of John Butler's book and think you and yours will treasure it.DISCLOSURE: I was provided a complimentary copy of Ten In the Den by Peachtree Publishers on behalf of the author for the purpose of my rending an honest review. Opinions expressed are solely my own and I was not obligated to give a positive review. The giveaway copy will also be provided by Peachtree Publishers and shipped directly to the winner."},{"Title":"Ten In The Den","review":"This was a favorite book of my Grandson, so I purchased it for my 2 1/2 year old Grand daughter for Christmas and I know she will Love it. I love the beautiful John Butler illustrations and the story is so cute. No child could resist."},{"Title":"Ten In The Den","review":"I will admit when I read this book for the first time I thought how dumb, I then had to read it over and over again for a few days, then the next thing I knew My one year old would sing the roll over, roll over, then she would do the bump thing. It is my favorite now. My youngest is so cute when we read it and we end up saying it when we are just doing random things. I'm so glad I bought this book it has brought a truely unreplaceable memory."},{"Title":"Ten In The Den","review":"We enjoy many of John Butler's books. I like that he uses different animals in the books. This book is good, we love \\"Can You Cuddle like a Koala?\\" and \\"Can You Growl Like a Bear?\\""},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"A book with 6 decades worth of wry New Yorker cartoons needs a strong coffee table and a big lap. Flipping through the book gives you a wonderful look at the flow of current affairs, both social and political. Along the way the editors give us a narrative that's a good course in the history of American humor in the 20th century.The real bonus, though, is not the book, which despite its being massive is not \\"Complete.\\" It has maybe 20% of the 60,000-plus cartoon promised on the cover. The complete set you want is on 2 CDs included in the book, and the CDs are searchable by topic, etc.So if you want a cartoon on consultants (and I'm a consultant), here's one: Two detectives stand over the prone lower half of a murder victim. \\"By the number an violence of the stab wounds,\\" says one, \\"I'd guess he was a consultant.\\"Buy the book so you can open it at any point and smile or laugh out loud; use the CDs to browse the whiole New Yorker cartoon universe and/or find the smiles and laughs you want."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I received this as a Christmas present and for almost four months I've treated myself to a slow and deliberate read through this remarkable book. It's been said that the New Yorker is \\"possibly the best magazine ever\\" and its success, in large part, is due to its weekly cartoons. This book delivers them all and what a collection it is!Setting it up in decade format with observations by noted humorists, it's quite easy to put this book down from time to time and I mean that in a most sincere way. The \\"chapter\\" divisions help to remind us of how humor has been perceived over the last eighty years. Although there are some cartoons I don't understand, largely due to the times, the ones that are funny are REALLY funny. Yet it's the variety of the cartoons that add so much luster to this offering and it is not surprising that so many themes (husband vs. wife, etc.) return over and over.I have not yet looked at the CD (which I understand has some viewing difficulties) and I had wished that this book had been printed in two volumes because of its heft. Having said that, nothing can make up for the sheer inventiveness of the men and women who present their comic genius. To be gifted in this field of life certainly must give as much pleasure to the cartoonist as it does to the reader. Buy this book, find a sturdy table for it and read it with the knowledge that the hundreds of pages that lie ahead will forever give you something about which to laugh."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Though I think it a bit confusing, I mean some cartoons in the book, some in the cd, the book in itself is a wonderful job. The span of the years is irrelevant to the quality of the cartoons.Very good acquisition."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"The straight benefit out of this work is the sheer number of occasions most anyone finds oneself laughing at/enjoying New Yorker cartoons regardless one's tastes! The added benefit comes from having all the cartoons in PDF version as well--alas their resolution is already inadequate for the newer computer screens. Besides the book's comprehensive index by authors, the software makes all cartoons searchable by all sorts of keywords--great capability when sleuthing for something, be it an author, an idea/theme, or a word. There is also a derivative benefit to be drawn by those students of social history, through the lens of high(er) class humor. I cannot say enough about this latter benefit for one's imagination is the limit. Countless will be the journeys to this work--get a second copy ;-)There is also a word of caution. Depending on one's style, one should pace oneself carefully through this work. Gulping vs. sipping, chewing vs. swallowing, and such, are all styles of going through this work one ought to considwer rather carefully, on each encounter, for this is one of the few things this package cannot achieve: to pace one through.Happy Anniversary to New Yorker, and, to its institutionalized pillar, New Yorker Cartoons!Nota Bene: Pair this work with \\"Covering the New Yorker,\\" for an all-round experience!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"A fabulous collection of American wit. A must for those nostalgic for past cartoons. Chronological glimpse of history through humor!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I mean, it's about broad enough to hold a few coffee cups, and the thickness makes you think. Maybe the book could be used as a coffee table by itself. Don't do it, though. You'll miss all the wonderful fun inside.The New Yorker cartoons have always been known for their urbane wit. Don't expect snooty subtlety in evey panel, though. James Thurber and Chas Addams appeared early on, and George Booth and Gahan Wilson appeared later, not to mention lots of others in the prat-fall and way-weird categories. Of course, Roz Chast's \\"90s neurotic\\", Edward Koren's fuzzy people, and Sidney Harris' in-jokes are all there, among the many other drawing styles you'll recognize.The book is organized by decade, from the 1920s to the early 2000s. I am fascinated by the changes of visual style, from 20s flappers to the people you see (and want to laugh at) every day. The topics drift, by decades, from the roaring 20s, through The Depression and WWII, past the Eisenhower doldrums, over the hippy 60s, into Reagonomics and out again, and up our current day. I don't know that anyone has ever based a history of America on its comics. If they ever did, however, they should start here.I admit, I haven't read all of the 68,000 or so comics on the DVD inserts. I'll allow myself years for that. Even the 650 pages of paper comics are daunting. Don't let that stop you. This is a rich experience, and one that will probably touch you at amny points, again and again. Let it.Visual literacy is part of literacy, and these cartoons are very literate.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Amazing book, great compilation of ALL New Yorker comics. This is a must have in your library or as a fun table book. Huge, heavy book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"The book was in perfect condition!

I was able to do a search of the word 'psychic' and pulled up 115 cartoons to satisfy my incredulous mind. In four seconds!I don't care what anybody says, this tome is just great! Sure, I could have a whinge like some have done over the quality, but even with my bad eyesight, I was able to print out some great laughs (and frame them if I like), and you can't beat the price at Amazon. One third off, if you please (which pays for the postage). I got mine in less than two weeks, and I live Down Under!I was surprised that Al Hirschfeld didn't do any work for the New Yorker. I thought S.J. Perelman had more pulling power than that. But apart from that disappointment, I am thrilled as all get out. Thanks a million, Mr. Mankoff."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"The book itself is beautiful, and nice articles to accompany the cartoons.And I'm very pleased that they used the cross-platform Adobe Acrobat format! I was afraid that some little proprietary crashy app would put a tiny 640x480 window in the middle of my screen, and was relieved to find that my existing Acrobat viewer would display it all just fine. (I remember how disappointed I was in the complete Mad Magazine on CD-ROM which required its own funny little viewer app.)They could have used a little better resolution in the scans, but I guess they didn't want to compete with the cartoon bank business. It's certianly \\"good enough\\" but don't try printing the cartoons too large"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I am waiting for this book for a very long time. And at last we have the complete collection, burned in 2 disks. My question is,Since the editors determined to publish such a valuable collection, why the resolution of the image is so low? Why not make a really pleasant collection? I am a bit angry with that, since for those cartoons with small fonts, the texts are almost illegible. And the low resolution lost all the fine touch of the cartoonist. Alas."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I just bought this book(the hard cover version) and think it's brilliant. The book itself is quite large but it's packed with cartoons from 8 decades. I like the fact that you have a real solid book. I've read some of the reviews about people complaining about the size of the book but unless you don't intend to read it while you're on the toilet, it is perfect for reading on a table or even your lap.The quality of the CDs are good as well. I don't know what everybody is complaining about. The book WITHOUT the CDs is worth much more than what I paid for. Having 2 CDs with over 68000(!!!) additional cartoons included make it the best book I ever bought."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I bought this book because last year I bought a New Yorker cartoons page-a-day calendar and enjoyed all 365 days of thought-provoking, timely humor. When my book arrived, I decided to savor the humor by reading four pages of cartoons every night before bed; sometimes, my husband thinks I'm going to bust a gut laughing.The included CD is fabulous, and allows you to search for cartoons by topic and keyword. Type in \\"therapist,\\" and you'll find some of the wittiest commentary you'll ever see on the topic. Cartoons on the disc are printable, and as a result, may result in my office needing a much bulletin board.This book is a gem and a chronicle--in humor--of the American Zeitgeist of the last 80 years."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"My husband bought me this book and at first I thought he was crazy. I mean, I know that Desperate Housewives isn't out on DVD yet, but couldn't he think of something better? That was what I thought. At first. Then I started to look through it, and soon I was completely transported. I guess I vaguely remember looking at New Yorker cartoons in my grandparents' house, and I guess I remember finding them funny, but I was totally unprepared for the wealth of material here. Some of the funniest cartoons are the earliest -- even though I wasn't alive in 1828 or whenever, I can respect and even appreciate the senses of humor of the people who were alive then. Also it's often beautiful artwork. Anyway, I wanted to thank my husband publicly for getting me this gift -- he can always get the DVDs next year."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I love the book. It's exactly what I had hoped--page after page of cartoons in a beautifully bound book that looks great on a coffee table. I can pick it up at any time and read a few and then put it down."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I have no idea what the other reviewers who see a \\"low resolution\\" image are talking about. The cartoons on the CD in PDF format and anyone who can run Adobe Reader can easily increase the zoom level. The pics are quite clear in all their glorious hilarity. The introductions for each decade are basic but to \\"get\\" some of the puns, one may need to research a bit into the parlance of that era especially those of us born a generation or two after the publication date."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I'm reading the cartoons on the CDs, at the rate of a year a day. Just dawned on me that this will take 80 days. Which means this gift will end up having the highest ROI since I got that set of Legos when I was ten!Tip for reading the book comfortably: Place book on bed or floor. Lie down in front of it. Prop chin on elbows and raise feet in air. Classic pose! Best done in front of a roaring fireplace.And yes, the resolution on the CDs isn't perfect. The one artist who *really* suffers because of this is Roz Chast, one of my favorites. :( But you do know you can zoom in, right?Also, to the one-star reviewer who suggested an editor: I disagree. The idea was to give everyone access to the cartoons they like, not to have an editor, or even a team of editors, pick and choose *their* idea of the best. For instance, I don't \\"get\\" William Steig for the life of me, but I wouldn't deny him to those who do. Similarly, I'd be disappointed if someone had said, \\"There's enough George Booth here; let's cut it down to a couple dozen.\\" TEHO, I say.And I was overjoyed to find the one Chas Addams that I *thought* was definitive (\\"One sashweight, one butcher's cleaver, fifty feet of half-inch rope...\\") but that wasn't included even in his own anthology!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I am determined to look at every one of the more than 68,000 cartoons presented in \\"The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker\\"! I figure, 700+ per year, so I do one year per day. My spirits are lifted immeasurably as I feast on this marvelous commentary on the human experience. Some cartoons are laugh-out-loud, some are slapstick style, some are poignantly heart-touching.I find that the cartoons from the first years, 1925 to early 1928, are rather snooty and mean-spirited in tone; but, beginning in later 1928, the cartoons begin to assume the recognizably insouciant form that contemporary readers relish. A very few of the references are \\"time-sensitive\\", relating to topics that are now forgotten; but most of the cartoons are as fresh and funny today as 75 years ago.A technical note: Some earlier reviewers have complained that the cd cartoons are \\"too small\\". If you use Adobe \\"zoom\\" you can magnify any of them to make them much larger so that the smaller, panel cartoons become readable.This \\"take to a desert island\\" book is an absolute must-have for New Yorker readers. I also recommend \\"Complete Book of Covers from The New Yorker: 1925-1989\\", a feast of artwork, which has graced our coffee table for many years."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"If you have read the New Yorker Magazine then you really will need no prodding in purchasing this fine set...for those of you who have never experienced New Yorker cartoons, I have two words for you...CHARLES ADDAMS....Charles Addams, the creator of the ADDAMS FAMILY, has many of his finest cartoons housed within this book and CDs....His brand of macabre humor served as the foundation, which Larson, Wilson, Kliban, and the rest, built their careers upon....this intro to Charles Addams work is only one of the many highlights in this set as you will find many other artists of high quality here, some of whom share Addams' dark style....this set, along with THE COMPLETE FAR SIDE, by Larson are the rosetta stones of illustrative humor... One note: Because there were so many cartoons (well over 60,000) you do not have them all present in the book, so only a rather large sampling is contained within...the CD's are where you will find the complete cartoons...but as it states in the book's forward, the tactile look and feel of handling the pages of cartoons is much better than reading them on a pc monitor which is why the book was produced and not just sold as a CD ROM only set...I could not agree more.... strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This looks like the gift book of the year. The book itself lays out a selection of cartoons from each decade, offering a great time capsule of the last 80 years. The accompanying CDs appear to contain about about 3 times as many cartoons as the mag's cartoonbank.com Website, but with the same search options (by cartoonist, topic, etc.).Mysteriously, there's a softcover edition floating around Amazon Marketplace, but you can't get it from Amazon proper or your local bookseller. I recommend the softcover, which I bought from a top-rated vendor Amazon Mktplace vendor. It's well-made, sturdily bound, and the same size as the hardcover edition. But it's much lighter in weight: I'd guess at least 30% lighter.This is a really oversize book (think Times Atlas of the World), and the hardcover edition is too heavy to handle conveniently. Many of the people who'd most appreciate this collection -- older folks who've read the mag for decades -- will find it too heavy to lift.My only real disappointment was reading \\"Made in China\\" on the front matter. I wish the mag, famous for its human-rights reporting, had printed this fine book in a country that respects basic human and labor rights."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Don't buy this book if you are interested in the 68,000 cartoons on the two CDs; the cartoons on the CDs are so low-res that in most cases you can't figure out what the joke is. And printing doesn't help - the printed vesions are just as bad. I spoke with the publisher and they told me that to protect the rights of the cartoonists they deliberately used low res."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This is a must-have for any New Yorker fan. The book is beautiful and includes many cartoons not published in book format previously. The two CDs include every cartoon ever published in the magazine, all in .pdf format (with Adobe Reader 6 included). The CDs are fully searchable on the captions and keywords (similar to the Cartoonbank.com website).By the very nature of its inclusiveness, not every cartoon is a winner, but its interesting to see the lesser known cartoons of the greats. For example, there are a number of Thurber drawings I've never seen previously.My only complaint is that the quality of some of the images is only fair, at best. Its especially noticeable when printing (even at the highest quality settings).But despite that caveat, the book and cds are a fantastic find for fans on the New Yorker cartoons."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Long before I ever picked up a copy of \\"The New Yorker,\\" I knew about the fact that it was a treasure trove of cartoons. My father had a hardcover collection of choice cartoons culled from the first four decades of the magazine's history and that was where I met the original Addams family drawn by \\"Chas. Addams,\\" the twisted looks at the world of by William Steig, Peter Arno, Robert J. Day, Mischa Richter, and others whose names I would not learn until years later even though I could instantly recognize their artistic styles. Weaned on such wonders it is not surprisingly that when I pick up a copy of \\"The New Yorker\\" I instantly flip through the magazine to look at each and every cartoon before going to look at what is happening in New York City in terms of shows and other entertainment that we can only dream about up here in the Zenith City.\\"The Complete Cartoons of 'The New Yorker'\\" is edited by the magazine's cartoon editor Robert Mankoff, so blame him for any and all errors regarding the selection of the 2,004 (ha ha) cartoons selected, and with a Foreword by editor-in-chief David Remnick. There are also essays on the life and times (and humor) of each decade from the 1920's of James Thurber to the 2000's of Matthew Differ, written by the sort of eminent scribes you except to find in \\"The New Yorker,\\" to wit: Roger Angell, Nancy Franklin, Lillian Ross, John Updike, Ian Frazier, Calvin Trillin, Mark Singer, and Rebecca Mead. But save those for after you have looked over the cartoons for each chapter, because then what they are talkinga bout will make more sense; then you can go back and look at the cartoons again to appreciate additional nuances.There is a lot of overlap between decades with these cartoonists because most of them stick around for decades, and why not? Is there a better gig for witty cartoons that \\"The New Yorker\\"? I suppose if there is such a thing as cultured (nee elitist) cartoons, this would be the place to find them, but this has certainly been a rich vein of humor for these talented artists to mine all these years. As you flip through this book you will find new favorites for each nine decades represents: Carl Rose and Gluyas Williams in the 1920s; Goerge Price and Alair in the 1930s; Garrett Price, Helen E. Hokinson, and Chon Day in the 1940s; Sydney Hoff and Robert J. Day in the 1950s; Saul Steinberg and William O'Brian in the 1960s; Joseph Mirachi, Henry Martin, Donald Reilly, and George Booth in the 1970s; Tom Cheney, Arnie Lewis, Edward Franscino in the 1980s; Robert Manhoff, Peter Steiner and Roz Chaast in the 1990s; and David Sipress, Alex Gregory, and Mick Stevens in what has passed for the 2000's to date.The book includes two CDs have all 68,647 cartoons ever published in \\"The New Yorker\\" (okay, published in \\"The New Yorker\\" up to that moment in the history of the universe, because already this thing is outdated). The CDs are browsable by date, subject, and cartoonist and while the resolution is not the greatest in the world, I was not that unhappy with it (but I am too lazy to change my out of date perscription for my eye glasses, so take that with a grain of salt). Anyhow, if you are in the Halloween spirit you can check out those cartoons this week or just go straight to the Addams collection like most people will do. The hard part is not to just sit in front of your computer and spend a hour or two short of 12 days to look at all of these cartoons (averaging one every 15 seconds), but you have to learn to ration these little treasures out. Besides, I am still trying to find my favorite one: a group of professors stand in front of a blackboard totally filled with the most complex formula in the history of the world and one of them finds where they went wrong: making a simple error in multiplication. Back to the hunt!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Fantastic cartoons, but the CDs have such low resolution images, that they are unviewable. I bought this collection to see all of Saul Steinberg's cartoons, and I am unfortunately limited to what was printed."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I personally love The New Yorker cartoons, and they're the first things I read when I get the magazine. Therefore, the prospect of being able to have every cartoon ever published was very exciting. The best part of this collection is that you can navigate to whatever cartoons you want to see, or you can simply browse through ones you have never seen before and discover a veritable treasure trove. One thing that I noticed was that many themes recur throughout the years and that some things that were relevant 50 years ago are still relevant now. Even in terms of politics and the way other countries feel towards America. Whoever rated this very low doesn't know what they're talking about. Sure the book is big, but if you wanted to read the cartoons in bed you could easily sit there with a laptop and peruse the cd-roms. Also, to those who said that the cartoons were low resolution, I noticed that in Adobe Acrobat where the cd opens, they give you the option to zoom in, therefore enabling you to read the caption. I observed this within minutes of opening the cd on my computer for the first time. I don't know whether other people just don't have this or were too impatient to realize it was there. In any case, I highly recommend this book to whoever likes New Yorker cartoons, or enjoys witty humor."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I bought this book nearly as soon as it came out, and I absolutely loved it. The cartoons and the layout of the book are superb. I did not really use the CD's, however, because I was in transition between computers. It was still nice knowing that there were 60,000 more cartoons waiting for me if ever I wanted to read them, and with the stellar quality of the book, I assumed the same for the CD's.I was wrong. The cartoons on the CD's are very low resoluton- this means that the pictures are not clear; they look a little blocky and pixelated. Also, the large, multi-panel cartoons have been compressed even more so as to fit on to one page. I was severely disappointed. The captions, however, are very nice. Too bad it's often difficult to see what they're referring to. I don't really have the complete cartoons of the New Yorker: I've got about half, with the other half illegibly thrown into the mix.Why then two stars? It's simple: The book itself is very nice. With the price lower now, It is a very reasonable price for the Best Cartoons of the New Yorker, which is what this book is without the CD's. The book is wonderful, just don't be confused into thinking that you will be able to read every cartoon as the book claims."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Since I received this book as a gift, I am not inclined to return it. If I had payed my own money for it I almost certainly would. The book itself is perfectly adequate, but the real promise was in the DVD, which apparently contains all of the cartoons from the magazine's history in PDF format. I won't blame the publisher for the poor interface offered by Acrobat Reader, and the index is fantastic. As noted elsewhere, however, the resolution of the scanned cartoons is abysmal. In many cases details critical to the humor of the cartoon are not clear.It is a mystery to me why the publisher has elected to use low resolution scans for this product. The PDF documents apparently include DRM protections to prevent large-scale copying of the cartoons (screen captures are still an option, but who would be that committed to stealing this material?), thereby protecting the New Yorker's Cartoon Bank property. So why give us thousands of cartoons in a barely viewable format? Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"There are two legitimate complaints about this wonderfuland wonderfully expensive book. The first is that it isvery large and very heavy. It can't be held on any lap inmy immediate family. The second is that the CD's, whichcontain all the cartoons ever published in the magazinedisplay and print unsatisfyingly low-resolution versionsof the originals.In my house, we made the first problem into a virtue. Ibought an old-fashioned music stand, tilted the top back tojust above the horizontal and put the book on it. Coveredwith a scarf to reduce the dust and placed under a lightthat switches on when the outside lights go down, it makesfor an interesting distraction for family and visitorsalike. That the whole thing is quasi-biblical makes it,for some at least, even funnier. For us residents, it means thathardly a day goes by without my flipping through a yearor two, or checking in on an old favorite.The second problem is more serious. There's somethingdownright stingy about making the cartoons so unappealingon the screen. I understand that the publisher may haveimagined us all laser-printing our own books of cartoonsand thereby depriving them of revenue, but I think theymay have lacked imagination.If I print out a cartoon and send it to a friend, that cartoonbecomes an ambassador for the book. There must be someother way to 'deface' the cartoons so that they don'tbecome copyright-busting wall art.One positive outcome from being cheated by the CD's is thatI'll never buy another book with CD illustrations withoutchecking on the resolution.But none of this should detract from the cartoons themselves.As a small boy, I occasionally spent my allowance on the NewYorker just to see them. They remain a slightly transgressivewindow into contemporary life. Things are said and suggestedin the cartoons that never made it to the editorial page ofthis magazine or any other.Buy this book for the panorama of the development of that slightlycock-eyed consciousness. There really is no substitute.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN 9781601640005"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"It was a gift to a friend...her thank you note reads \\"I am really enjoying my New Yorker cartoon book.

Must buy!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Have enjoyed the New Yorker since I was old enough to turn the pages. This book is a \\"real history of our times\\" in addition to being a pleasure to read. Depressions, wars, politics, and general attitudes are shown with all their \\"warts and wrinkles\\". This is a wonderful book, but read it sitting at your desk, or kitchen table, or some other sturdy base. Take several days to go through it, (at the very least), since cartoon meltdown is a real possibily if taken all at once. Aside from the \\"reading logistics\\" it's a great book."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"It was fascinating to look at how cartoons have evolved over the decades. Great fun and great to appreciate how life was way back then, to realize it hasn't changed all that much! A good 'coffee table' book which many people enjoy poring over."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I grew up on New Yorker cartoons. Back in the 50s, our family had a book (which I still have) called \\"Cartoon Cavalcade.\\" My sisters and I read it over and over again.It was a collection of the best American cartoons from the 19th century to roughly World War II, which is when this old book was published. The New Yorker placed probably half of the cartoons in there from 1920 to 1944.Because TNY had the best cartoonists: Peter Arno, Gahan Wilson (yep, the one who still puts one in every so often), Berger, and many more. Witty and classy stuff. I loved that book, and will buy this new collection for its rarity and sheer pleasure.The National Lampoon became my humor magazine when I grew up. They parodied TNY brilliantly in one issue, with full articles, \\"Talk of the Town,\\" and more. And cartoons. In one cartoon an African-American couple are reading menus at a fancy restaurant, with a white waiter speaking to them. The caption reads, \\"We're all out of food - scram.\\"Captures it perfectly. Even now, as in the 70s, as in the 30s, TNY rarely depicts anybody but white people in their cartoons.It should not be surprising. Back in the 1990s, if you tried to visit the New Yorker website, you were firmly informed that TNY was not that declasse - having a website was for lesser beings. Maybe that's why its whites-only cartoon editorial policy continues into the new millenium.TNY is a wonderful magazine with first-rate literature and journalism. Few would argue that its viewpoint is anything but social and economic liberalism. Why, then, is it so opposed, de facto, to diversity??"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Mankoff's \\"The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker\\" is, first of all, for fans of The New Yorker magazine and its weekly feast of cartoons. Yet even for those who don't read the magazine, this book offers a wonderful compliation of cartoons going back to the 1920's all the way through the 2004. It comes with two CDs that are searchable by author and topic. This is a must-have for those who enjoy the sophisticated and topical cartoons of those gifted artists published by The New Yorker."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"A real study in the evolution of society and humor. I consistently laughed at either the cartoon itself or the change in mores and folkways. This collection is a treat!"},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I wanted to clarify some doubts about the resolution of the cartoons on the CDs. They are perfectly fine and don't know how it can be better. The CD contains cartoons in pdf documents, and there is one cartoon per page. Each cartoon is dated and has the cartoonist's name. I didn't find any problem at all. I am using Adobe Acrobat reader 7.0 and Windows Vista OS. The CD couldn't directly launch pdf which I suspect is because of Vista. Hence, I just opened mainmenu.pdf directly from adobe acrobat reader and was really happy. Please go ahead and buy this, the CDs are not low resolution."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This book/CD project had great potential but was spoiled for me by its deceptive advertising and packaging. Obviously a computer which reads CDs would be necesssary but nowhere in the advertising or the book and its packaging is mention made of the software (operating system and reader) necessary to view the CDs. You have to make a purchase and open the package and try the CDs before you learn that. I work with CDs on my preferred computer but had to borrow another in order to view these CDs...and then, like one of the other reviewers, was disappointed in the quality."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This is the best collection of cartoons I have ever seen, with the possible exception of an old Ziggy book I have. Ha ha ha. I am joking about Ziggy. This is the best collection of cartoons I have ever seen. From Charles Adams to Roz Chast to Bruce Eric Kaplan, all my favorite New Yorker cartoons are in here, along with others I didn't even know about until now. This is like the Oxford English Dictionary of funny little panels. Also, to the reader below who says that his CDs do not work, I think the problem is that he does not know how to use the software. In other words, he is defective, not the book."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I lament, along with other reviewers the terrible horrible very bad image quality of the CDs. The problem is NOT a question of space on the CDs - just the opposite. If you save a typical cartoon to your computer, you will find that it makes a huge file - more than one megabyte. But if you scan the same perfect-quality cartoon from the book at a reasonable resolution, say 100 dots per inch, you will get a fine image at perhaps one-tenth of the size or less of the terrible image off the CD. A curious consequence is that instead of two CDs, they could have packaged a complete single CD with far better images.As a college instructor, I bought the book in part for classroom use, and that requires displaying cartoons on an overhead projector. The projected image quality is so bad that the cartoons are unusable.The New Yorker seems to be non-communicative about this fiasco - my email to Robert Mankoff went unanswered.I hoped that the Complete New Yorker - the entire contents of all of the magazines, including the cartoons, would solve the problem, but the reviews for that product are not promising. Such sadness - such attitude!On the other hand, the book is 5-star wonderful - fine quality reproductions, and a unique way to enjoy studying history. If the CD were up to snuff, this set would be 5 stars. I rate the package 1 star to warn prospective buyers like me, who want or need the CDs."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Of course, New Yorker cartoons are brilliant, either in each one's humor, or in the lightness of their humor as a group. So: five stars, for this American cultural institution of silliness.And yes, this is /all/ the cartoons that the New Yorker ran between 1925 and 2004.But there's a few extra facts you might want to know:* It's a \\"coffee table\\" book-- so big that it can practically /be/ a coffee table-- it's just under a foot across, just over a foot tall, two inches thick, and weighs twelve pounds. You will not be reading this in bed.* It indeed \\"includes two CDs with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine\\".* Very importantly, those cartoons are PDF files! Moreover, using a modern version of Acrobat (and installers come on the CDROMs), you can search the index of the cartoons and, for example, browse only the ones by Charles Addams. The files are at fairly high resolution. If you're on an OS with no Acrobat available (maybe Linux? maybe Kindle?), you can still use some other PDF viewer applications.So if you copy the PDFs to your hard drive, then all the New Yorker cartoons ever will go from an untransportably large book, to being a weightless bit of fun on your laptop, for those many moments when a New Yorker cartoon is exactly what you need to make (non)sense of the day. Moreover, any cartoon that strike your fancy, you can get put onto a print, t-shirt, etc, at their web Cartoonbank site."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I've been quite a fan of cartooning for a number of years - from modern strips like the Far Side and Calvin & Hobbes to the classic cartoons of Esquire and the New Yorker, and of particular cartoonists (such as Peter Arno and, more recently, Charles Addams, of \\"The Addams Family\\" fame). I was searching one day for a book on New Yorker cartoons over the years, and was greatly pleased to have found this - \\"The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker\\" is as good as its title suggests (up to 2006, that is).Here's what is included: a hefty volume of phone-book proportions (670 pages) in large format (suitable for a coffee table or a good, sturdy bookshelf), on good, glossy, quality paper. In this book are collected a massive \\"best of\\" selection of New Yorker cartoons from 1925 on through 2006; additionally included are comments and biographies (usually 2-page spreads) on artists (Arno and Addams among them) as well as certain themes that continually crop up in the cartoons - television, for instance, or the space race.This, however, is only scratching the surface. Within the front cover, in a little transparent plastic sleeve is a DVD-ROM disc, which contains each and every one of the more than 70,000 cartoons published in the New Yorker up through 2006. The cartoons are set up in a PDF format (no worries - if you don't have Adobe Acrobat, the disc allows you to download it) for easy reading and access.I have very few qualms about the book itself; I am, however, a little disappointed with the DVD-ROM. Essentially, it isn't as easy to search for the cartoons as you might hope. The disc is broken down into decades, and those decades are broken down into specific years. As far as I've been able to ascertain, you can only search for the cartoons of a particular artist within a certain year - you can't, for instance, just type in \\"Sid Hoff\\" and come up with all of his cartoons ever published in the New Yorker; you have to find a particular year and search for him within it. While this may seem like a quibble (I mean, really, they're giving you all of their cartoons - for less than $30!) it is rather disappointing, and makes it difficulty to pick and choose what you want. Also, while the PDF format allows you to enlarge the cartoons, you can't make them much larger than 100% without them beginning to get fuzzy.Overall, anyone interested in comic art, American culture, or a good, educated laugh will appreciate this book and this disc; those who are not very tech-savvy, however, may want to think twice."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"Absolutely Amazing !!!I always meant to subscribe to the New Yorker, mostly for the Cartoons, but never did. Now I can make up for all those years of deprivation. The book itself is wonderful. The CD's are very easy to use and make viewing the tens of thousands of cartoons a pleasure; their resolution is excellent and the navigation system is superb.Looking thru cartoons of many years past is a real education. What fun to find that most of them are still hilarious. My kids couldn't put it down. We all loved it. You will too!!!While this collection would make a fantastic gift, make sure you order a copy for yourself too. There are countless hours of laughter, joy, and entertainment here."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"\\"The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker\\" is a wonderful collection of consistently funny cartoons that, more times than not, make us laugh at our own short-sightedness and habits. My only complaint, and the only reason I didn't give this five stars, is that the resolution of the images on the included DVD-ROM is not that great. In some cases, it's a bit difficult to catch the \\"sight gag\\" in the illustration- unacceptable. Too bad- a little more care in this department would have made this a near-perfect volume."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"How many times have I looked at a New Yorker cartoon and burst out laughing, and then thinking about this understood that the cartoon perfectly embodies a current mood, or social fashion or foible. Witty, sophisticated, insightful. But the laughter given in a moment does not lend itself to unending, endless repetition. Reading through Cartoons like this cover to cover is a different experience from catching one rare one at a time.A good chunk of American social history is in these cartoons, but perhaps most importantly many are miniature pieces of brilliance , and delight.Thus the recommendation. Dip in and dip out, enjoy here and there what happens to catch the eye. Forget the misses, and there are misses, whether through being made stale by Time or not. There is enough really good stuff here not to be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"As a youngster in grade school more than sixty years ago, I discovered The New Yorker. My parents permitted/encouraged reading of almost anything, so I rather grew up with the magazine (we were not affluent, so I don't know what my source was, but I had frequent access to the magazine). I learned from the articles and reviews, but I loved the cartoons. Still do. Now I have them all. Delightful."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This is a heavy book. I tried to read this book while I was lying in bed. I held the book above my face, but after several minutes my arms became enfeebled and weak, and I had to put it down. I was unable to use my arms to full capacity for the new few days, and it was arduous even to raise an arm to put my key in the lock. Once I regained full strength, I attempted to again read this book while prostrate -- positioning it above my head -- but my left arm gave out in a spasm and I dropped the book onto my face. I'm fed up and no longer try to read this book in bed."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"The New Yorker: some people love it; others find it pathetically lifeless, dated, out of touch, pandering to upper middle-class wanna-bes, required subscription for class-conscious dentist waiting rooms, elitist, the last refuge for Eastern writer types who still write about Manhattan WASPS as if their downtown culture mattered to (or interested) anyone but themselves, etc. What you get here, you get a lot of, at least. You get every cartoon published in the New Yorker since the first isssue. That is more than 60,000 cartoons - in book form and on a Windows/Mac compatible CD (the cartoons are in PDF format. Resolution may not always be that great but each one was viewable and readable to this reviewer). Problem is, these are New Yorker style humor cartoons. I found myself zipping from cartoon to cartoon trying to find funny ones. Plenty of mild observations and one liners that wouldn't exactly bring a party to its knees with laughter. Plenty of rich/poor jokes. Plenty of upper class \\"problems\\". Plenty of fashion/style complaints. Very, very few laughs. You have to wonder if the editors actually thought these were funny or if they only thought that they would flatter the mindset of the demographic that they hoped would subscribe to the New Yorker because they thought they wanted to be the type who subscribed to the New Yorker. I think the latter.Here, in Florida, I met a writer for the NY who was vacationing. He was one of their latest young finds and had sold several stories to the New Yorker. He was drinking very heavily around the pool one day. I asked him - rudely, I admit - if he was the type who filled that magazine with stories about the \\"depressed, self-absorbed rich kids of wealthy, priviledged, and shallow Manhattanites\\". Without any hesitation, he replied, \\"Of course, I do. That's the kind of S--- that they want! That's right up their alley!\\"I can just imagine some cartoonist carefully following the NY cartoon formula in order to sell his cartoons to them.

As to the quality of the CD cartoons on my screen, no problem. The default seems to be fifty-two percent of the original and there is the option to make them any size if you want to, the captions come out black and are perfectly readable. I really didn't expect more than sixty-eight thousand cartoons to be of pristine quality unless the originals were scanned and this would obviously make copyright problems, so I am quite happy with what I see on screen.As it is I have a wonderful (handsomely designed and printed) book of cartoons and the option to see, on the CDs, all the work of my favorites, Charles Saxon, Robert Weber, Sam Gross, Chon Day and Bill Hamilton's brilliant work about the goings-on in the financial world.

So now I have two, one gift-wrapped for Mom, and the other for me and my family.

BUT, more than half at least are just fine like that, so there's 40,000 cartoons to enjoy. Why not see that as simply a very big bonus?The real deal here is 2,000 well-printed cartoons from some of America's most consistently trenchant cartoonists over the last eight decades. For twenty bucks, that seems pretty fair.Over a thousand cartoons from Arno, Addams and Wilson alone? That right there is worth the ticket price. These guys are geniuses, and while no one will love everything here, anyone who is literate and possessed of a sense of humor will find many moments of sheer pleasure.Those who find these cartoons too \\"high-brow\\", semi-oxymoronicism aside, will get by with their daily dose of Garfield and Family Circus.

I wanted this book since the day I spotted it in the bookstore, but held off because of the price. I was particularly anxious to see the 2 CDs. But the cartoons are all LOW RESOLUTION--what a disappointment. I can understand why--they don't want people to be able to print high-res versions...to still have to go to their website if they want to do that. But they should have announced that on the cover. Really--it is almost sinful. What a RIP-OFF. Read the other comments here about how unreadable some of the cartoons are because of the LOW-RESOLUTION. Really disgusting."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"The book is outstanding (hence one star) but the New Yorker is engaging in a form of fraud for claiming that the CDs contain all the cartoons ever published. In actual fact the CDs are of such low resolution that MANY of the cartoons cannot be interpreted because the caption or even the entire drawing is illegible. If a drawing is too illegible to interpret it is the same as not being included. I love the cartoons of the New Yorker and it was incredibly frustrating browsing the CDs and repeatedly finding cartoons that simply cannot be read. Enlarging them doesn't help. You WILL get a headache. The publisher should retract their claim and remove the illegible cartoons from the CDs. And shame on them for foisting this on those of us who truly love their cartoons."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I bought this for the promise of \\"Every cartoon ever published in The New Yorker.\\" But the resolution of 96 pixels/inch is so bad that the point of subtle cartoons is completely lost.

You can see there's a sign but there's no way to read it."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"What a great book. I've always thought there was a doctoral dissertation lurking in cartoons on the pages of the New Yorker, and now I'm sure of it. Look at the difference in style and content across the decades, look at the cartoons that were funny in 1950 and see what is still funny now and what has become outdated, look at the vast changes in cartooning!But most of all, just look at all of these thousands, no, tens of thousands of cartoons and have a good time. The book is gold, with its 2,004 cartoons, and the essays about the decades and the artists are very well done, but if the book is gold, then there's platinum in the CDs.One thing - if you're a Mac user, as I am, be aware that you really need OSX to make this work (a detail some purchase sites don't mention)."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"IF you want this book almost exclusively for reading the cartoons - on paper - by all means buy it. They are delightful, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The cartoons are a terrific history lesson of the culture of the New Yorker reader. For example, while FDR was being re-elected three times by historic margins, the New Yorker reader identified with wealthy characters who couldn't stand his egalitarian economics. Fascinating and funny besides.IF you are largely looking forward to the CD-ROM's, DON'T buy this book under any circumstances. As reported elsewhere, the cartoons are so poorly reproduced that signs - often essential to the laugh - are completely illegible. Also, sometimes Adobe Reader will obscure cartoons under a gray \\"filter\\". The filter doesn't disappear until the magnification reaches 200%, by which time the poor quality is far worse. Also, at 200%, the cartoon is often so large that you can't see the whole thing on your screen. Mind-boggling.How could \\"The New Yorker\\" jeopardize their reputation with these shoddy CD's? I understand their concerns about people re-publishing good copies, but as it stands, these CD's are extremely frustrating and guaranteed to annoy and disappoint. I have had more satisfying experiences with CD-ROM's that came free on a Cheerios box."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This would have been a great idea, to have all of the cartoons from the New Yorker. But the resolution on the disks is so poor that they are useless. Certainly, the cost of a few more disks (so that the resolution could be adequate) wouldn't have put this book out of the price range for those interested in buying it. It looks as though someone just decided to do the minimum, so that they could claim that all the cartoons are there, with little or no concern about the quality of the images."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"While living in the USA (1955-'61), I regularly bought the New Yorker every week - and one day in 1955, in a pile of trash, I found the first volume of collection of its cartoons some fool had thrown away. It remained one of the most treasured items in my library until it mysteriously disappeared (it surely wasn't me to throw it away again...). So, I've welcomed this book with open arms: to see again the production of Peter Arno, Charles Addams, George Price, Steinweg, and so many others... I've taken off one star from the full complement of 5 because I can't understand why they made the CD-Rom's readable with Windows '95 or '98 and not with XP, which makes me have to use a very old PC. Couldn't they come out with a Windows XP-compatible version of the CD-Rom's? or is it just me who's not familiar enough with PC's? Anyway, all I have to do is to use my old relic. The enjoyment is well worth the price of this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"The book is BIG and wonderful. It not only sits on my coffee table, but with a few legs, it could be my coffee table. The best part however are the two CDs. No way could one volume hold all the cartoons ever in the New Yorker. The CDs are great because they can be sorted, searched and you can even print out any cartoon you really like. Do you have any idea how many cartoons Charles Addams drew for this magazine?(715 in the 1929-64 CD alone) You can look at them, and anyone else, and sort in many many ways. I got 2017 hits in the same CD by typing \\"war\\" into the search field. What a resource! Just the thing for a winter's evening. The book will even keep your lap warm."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"This is pretty much the definition of the phrase, \\"Be careful what you ask for...\\" OK, the massive coffee table book of New Yorker cartoons is one thing -- and a good thing at that. But the two CD's with every cartoon ever published in the New Yorker are just evil.Drop the CD into your computer, pick any year from 1925 to 2004 -- and suddenly you're browsing around 900 cartoons from that year! Hours pass easily as you click through literally many tens of thousands of New Yorker cartoons.The cartoons are in Acrobat (pdf) format, and you need Acrobat version 6 or later, which will require some people to upgrade. The disk is readable by PC's and Mac's ( OS X or later, only because there's no version 6 for Mac OS 9.x or lower.) The Acrobat interface also allows you to search by cartoonist name, which is a huge boon.This is a world class gift -- and my advice is to not take the chance someone will forget to buy it for you. I'm giving four and already have one for myself..."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"There are two legitimate complaints about this wonderfuland wonderfully expensive book. The first is that it isvery large and very heavy. It can't be held on any lap inmy immediate family. The second is that the CD's, whichcontain all the cartoons ever published in the magazinedisplay and print unsatisfyingly low-resolution versionsof the originals.In my house, we made the first problem into a virtue. Ibought an old-fashioned music stand, tilted the top back tojust above the horizontal and put the book on it. Coveredwith a scarf to reduce the dust and placed under a lightthat switches on when the outside lights go down, it makesfor an interesting distraction for family and visitorsalike. That the whole thing is quasi-biblical makes it,for some at least, even funnier. For us residents, it means thathardly a day goes by without my flipping through a yearor two, or checking in on an old favorite.The second problem is more serious. There's somethingdownright stingy about making the cartoons so unappealingon the screen. I understand that the publisher may haveimagined us all laser-printing our own books of cartoonsand thereby depriving them of revenue, but I think theymay have lacked imagination.If I print out a cartoon and send it to a friend, that cartoonbecomes an ambassador for the book. There must be someother way to 'deface' the cartoons so that they don'tbecome copyright-busting wall art.One positive outcome from being cheated by the CD's is thatI'll never buy another book with CD illustrations withoutchecking on the resolution.But none of this should detract from the cartoons themselves.As a small boy, I occasionally spent my allowance on the NewYorker just to see them. They remain a slightly transgressivewindow into contemporary life. Things are said and suggestedin the cartoons that never made it to the editorial page ofthis magazine or any other.Buy this book for the panorama of the development of that slightlycock-eyed consciousness.

Maybe I will buy one for myself too...who knows."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I suspect, from the reviews I've seen, that New Yorker cartoons are an acquired taste, like British TV comedy. Some people get it, some don't. When I first started working in public libraries, back in the late \`60s, and I was covering the Reference Desk at night, I used to go down to the periodical stacks in the basement and pull an old bound volume of NEW YORKER, just so I could browse through the cartoons. (I used to haul out old volumes of the late lamented SATURDAY REVIEW, too, for the Double Crostics.) That's where I first came upon Sam Gross's oddball mind, and George Booth, who practically invented the curmudgeon, and Charles Saxon's highly original take on almost everything, and the consumate artist Saul Steinberg, and all the others. They were seldom \\"hah-hah\\" funny but I always sat there grinning my head off at the drolleries and the artists' highly original views of life. Some cartoons are pretty Gotham-centric, but not really that many -- not if you pay attention to anything outside your own little corner of the universe. This being a literary magazine, the humor is more often written than visual -- this ain't BEETLE BAILEY -- but there are plenty of examples of pure comic art with no text at all. This massive volume, which takes two hands to lug around, was my Christmas present to myself, and after a fast cruise from cover to cover (which still took three days), I've settled in to an extended perusal. Maybe I'll even build this monster its own mahogany reading stand. Two CDs are included, with all the cartoons in PDF files, searchable by artist and subject. There's a certain amount of variability in the quality of reproduction (in the book itself occasionally, too), but that's a very minor complaint."},{"Title":"The Complete Cartoons Of The New Yorker","review":"I never can figure out the point of many of the New Yorker's cartoons. Maybe it's because I live about as far away from New York as possible, both geographically and otherwise.

So, without the touchstone of knowing what references are being aluded too...many of the cartoons don't come across as well as they did the week they were originally published.I also found the constant idea that all New Yorkers are cool, hip and connected...while those of us unfortunate not to live there are the eternal country bumpkin...Ideas like this can grow tired in a collection this largeWhile I still find the absurdity of the 60's and 70's cartoons engaging and funny today and frankly the best of the lot. I find many of the cartoons from the Tina Brown years and beyond to posess more negative attitude than humor. The nowness of today became more inportant than just being funny.Its a good collection but is really all too much. I defy anyone to read all 60,000....because then you certainly wouldn't find cartoons funny.

Despite his attempts at protection, she is pregnant--and despite everything he says, she will have the child. When a flood leaves Andrea and millionaire businessman Nicholas Avery stranded in his aunt's home, Andrea knows she needs to tell him the truth--the reason she left and what she needs if she is to return to being his wife. But Nick has problems of his own--his own father was cruel and alcoholic. Nick fears that he would be no better--and would rather be no father at all than the only kind of father he ever knew. That Andrea has withheld the truth from him won't help. Worse, though, is that their enforced togetherness is making Andrea think about how nice it would be to make a real family.Author Judy Christenberry delivers an emotionally compelling story of fear and growth. Only by taking a chance can Nick learn to love. Only by telling the truth can Andrea discover Nick's true feelings. Yet, the very actions that might bring them joy are also the actions that hold the largest risk. Christenberry's light style makes for a fast read, compelling the reader through to the final crisis--and beyond."},{"Title":"Daddy on the Doorstep","review":"I'm a very big Judy Christenberry fan and have anxiously awaited this book for months. When I finally read it, I was disappointed because I don't feel that it's up to Christenberry's standards.Nick Avery is a rich, handsome, sexy businessman. He's been married to Andrea for six months. During their marriage, Nick works later and later trying to avoid having to talk with Andrea. Although he lavishes her with things, he only comes home to sleep with her. After six months, Andrea realizes she doesn't really know Nick. She does know, however, that he never wants to be a father. Having grown up an orphan in foster homes, Andrea wants children more than anything. When she finds out she's pregnant, she leaves Nick rather than have her child grow up with a father that doesn't love it.Nick and Andrea both rush to see Nick's Aunt Bess during a terrible storm. Aunt Bess turns out not to be at home and Nick and Andrea get stuck together for several days. During this time, Nick keeps asking why Andrea won't come back to him. He accuses her of all sorts of dastardly deeds. For her part, Andrea won't just tell Nick she's pregnant.

Jessy, pregnant with twins, feels secure in her marriage, except when Ty's ex-wife Tara creates tension in their lives. Tara has now come to realize she lost a good thing when she divorced Ty Calder. When the Calder's hold an auction on their land, Tara finds many reasons to visit, scheming to gain the Calder's trust, as she helps with auction preparations.Through the grapevine, Tara learns a piece of land the Calder's lease on the ranch can be bought for the right price. As the new owner of some Calder land she attempts to drive a wedge between Jessie and Ty, with no regard to the children, or other's lives. As the plans for Tara's new home on the property come together, she tries to find ways to integrate herself back into the Calder family, but finds herself pushed farther and farther away. Can Tara split Jessie and Ty?The novel GREEN CALDER GRASS has many wonderful characters, and a plot that brings love and happiness into the reader's heart. As a strong loveable woman, Jessy will appeal to the reader's senses. My favorite line in the entire novel sums up her character beautifully, she told Ty even though she could \\"ride like a man and work like a man, that didn't mean you didn't like flowers and candy.\\" City girl, Tara is brought to life, when she throws her classiness around, trying to make herself appear superior, which gives the reader a comparison of city and country life that makes the story a treat to read. Ty, trying to please his wife and keep harmony with his ex-wife comes across as a strong man, full of integrity, determination, and honesty. The Calder legend lives on through him, he is a fair man, who treats all with respect, and doesn't let wrongdoing get past him.Ms. Dailey has created a delightful story full of love and heartache that is sure to delight any romance reader. The love and honesty shine through the scenes in GREEN CALDER GRASS, without the sexual content that makes some readers feel uncomfortable. This is a must read this summer, a novel to share with your family, and friends. The second novel in the series, SHIFTING CALDER WIND is out in hardback, and I look forward to reading more about the trials and tribulations of the Calder family. ......"},{"Title":"Green Calder Grass","review":"The best!!!

As a reader, I felt used.Most people read romance novels because they enjoy seeing relationships develop and they like happy endings (something we frequently don't get in real life). This novel was devoid of both these elements.Forewarned is forearmed: The tale is interesting enough, because Dailey is an accomplished wordsmith, but the conclusion will not put a sigh on your lips or a smile on your face."},{"Title":"Green Calder Grass","review":"I was so excited about buying this latest book since I had read all of the Calder books and enjoyed them very much.

I love Ty and Jessy's story the best, now there are 2 more books about them. Let's buy them!\\"What a mistake!!!!!!!!!!It doesn't seem like Ty and Jessy are as delighted for the twins as they should be, after having had miscarriages.Tara remembers she loves Ty after 6 years of being divorced.Ty thinks longingly about how it would have been staying married to Tara. When they kiss, it's interupted by someone. and it's described \\"innocent\\". Ty has no remorse for doing it, and in a typical macho way hits the guy who says something about his double morals.The missing tension, I added with my fantasy of what is coming while reading (Ty almost sleeping with Tara. Tara finding Ty wounded with a memory loss. He only trusts her. Moves in with her after Jessy thinks he loves Tara, and it's the best for him. But love is stronger then anything, and Ty is drawn to Jessy.)Isn't it much better?And if somebody had to die- well.. Chase is kinda boring (if u get the hint, Janet), and unless he's gonna admit he loves Sally, the only thing for him is to die. and by natural causes.Two books from now, Logan is dead, and somehow Jessy's daughter turns out to be like Tara.That's it.

Maggie is my fabourite character, followed by Chase. Green Calder Grass, I think has a great plot, is very well written, though lacking in the romance department.

Ty and Jessy are my favorite characters, after reading this book I went back to reread \\"Calder Born, Calder Bred\\" where they first fell in love.It was wonderful to read more about Ty and Jessy in \\"Green Calder Grass\\", they are very happy with the birth of their twin daughter and son. And of course Tara (Ty's first wife)should come back into the picture. Tara's father suddenly dies and she manages to get Ty and his sister Cat to attended his Texas furneral. She uses that opportunity to get an invatation to visit them in Montana. From then on Tara uses everything she can to instigate herself back in Ty's life because she wants him back. Jessy is very lady like with putting up with Tara, she doesn't trust Tara's motives. I commend Jessy, she abosolutely my favorite Calder wife of all the series. She stands up for herself and doesn't not back down from nothing. Although it took a tradegy for her to finally stand up to Tara, I look forward to read more about Jessy and her twins in the next Calder book.I was devestated with death of a main character, but it was just like life and their is not always happy endings.

Their story was already done in Calder Born Calder Bred. I thought the arrival of twins after Jessy had had miscarriages (as mentioned in Calder Pride) was far fetched. Where was the love story? Tara barging her way back into their lives and making trouble was ridiculous. How on earth did she think that Ty would want her when she had gone behind his back? There were just too many holes in this plot. There were some poignant moments in the final scenes. Yes, in real life people die tragically all the time and people in love are separated but this was a novel we were reading and it just did not make sense. I don't think Dailey did justice to Ty's character instead I think she was too concerned with making Jessy into the next cattle queen. I think it was a mistake for Dailey to focus on Ty and Jessy's story again mainly because there was nothing much to say. We already knew they were madly in love and Tara's presence didn't change that. ... I think Dailey is a brilliant romance writer.

There seemed to be more chemistry between Chase and Buck than Ty and Jessy.Also, I know this is just fiction but I think I hate Tara. She annoys me and just seems to detract from the story of two people who are very in love and trying to start a family while running a huge ranch. Having Ty die at the end of the story made me wish she had just quit with Calder Pride. I am sure I will probably read the next books, but I might wait until they come out in paperback next time."},{"Title":"Green Calder Grass","review":"Readers will definately want to read the other books in the Calder series to truly appreciate the characters in this story. Dailey does a wonderful job of luring you into the story and keeping you there, with her wonderful detailed description and the love of the characters who we know so well. In this continuation of the Calder series, Chase Calder is back, along with his son Ty and daughter-in-law Jessy. Ty and Jessy face problems from the past in the form of Ty's first wife Tara, who forces her way back into their lives intent on starting trouble. This story takes some unbelievable twist and turns that will test the emotions of true Calder fans. Those who are looking for a story big on romance and \\"traditional\\" happy endings might be dissapointed, but for those looking for a story with strong Family roots, a deep love of land and family, strong characters, and a promise of more to come, will not be dissapointed. Well done Janet Dailey."},{"Title":"Green Calder Grass","review":"I was really enjoying Green Calder Grass until the death of Ty.I have read and loved all the Calder books, that is why I was so disapointed in the killing of the main character.The surprise ending was not worth killing off Jessy's husband, Chase's son and the twins father.This is a fictional story, I wish Janet Dailey would have made it end better."},{"Title":"Green Calder Grass","review":"I really loved the series but found it difficult when Maggie died. When Ty was killed I was so upset I couldn't stop crying, it ruined it for me. I just don't know if I can put myself through that again."},{"Title":"A Coloring Book of Ancient China","review":"The designs in this book are interesting and beautiful enough to entertain an adult, though they would be too challenging for a young child."},{"Title":"A Coloring Book of Ancient China","review":"Don't let the picture they show fool you. It's one of the only decent pictures in the whole book! The rest of the pictures were really disappointing compared to that!Other problems I had with this book... there are false deities or mythological figures in it, which some may not exactly appreciate. Secondly, while it LOOKS like one of the many coloring books out there aimed at adults, it's got big-print words in it like it's for kids. I would never give a kid that needs words that size, pictures that would require this much detailed coloring. The kid would go nuts trying to do it. And adults will probably find it disappointing after seeing the picture they show here.Maybe it's just me but, I really did not care for this at all."},{"Title":"DIAGNOSTIC THORACIC RADIOLOGY","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in chest radiology or pulmonary diagnostic challenges. Dr. Miller has chosen excellent cases to illustrate a broad range of chest pathology. Moreover, the book is pitched toward to clinician. I read the book cover to cover in preparation for the pulmonary boards and enjoyed it throughout. Dr. Miller should be commended for producing such an informative and accessible chest radiology text."},{"Title":"DIAGNOSTIC THORACIC RADIOLOGY","review":"The book is great. The only thing is that the images in kindle version of the book are so small it is impossible to see anything. And there is no way to enlarge them ! The same happens to tables -looks like they are poor quality photos of a printed book. Cannot enlarge them either. If I had a printed book I would rate it as five stars."},{"Title":"DIAGNOSTIC THORACIC RADIOLOGY","review":"A phenomenal resource for any clinician. The book offers a wealth of information but is presented in a structured and logical way that is easy to read and user-friendly for the clinician. The book really helped me to handle what I found overwhelming at first and develop a systematic approach to the various radiographic patterns. It is filled with CXR and CT images from every imaginable clinical scenario and invaluable tables of differential diagnosis. The book provides a truly clinical approach to chest radiology. I imagine myself using this book for a very long time."},{"Title":"DIAGNOSTIC THORACIC RADIOLOGY","review":"This is absolutely the best book for chest radiology. The size is a little intimdating at first, but it reads quickly and is filled with incredibly useful descriptions and differential diagnoses. It is straight-forward, and makes learning Chest Radiology a lot easier. I wish they had books like this for all sections of radiology. This book is ideal for residents and fellows, or really ambitious med students."},{"Title":"DIAGNOSTIC THORACIC RADIOLOGY","review":"The book is fantastic. It is well laid out in a logical and easy to follow fashion. The format focusses on differential diagnoses to radiological patterns - i.e. a practical clinical approach. The images are clear and all relate to clinical cases. I would go as far as to say that this is a \\"must-have\\" for any pulmonary fellow in training - there are few books which are as high yield as this one. Could not have asked for a better investment."},{"Title":"DIAGNOSTIC THORACIC RADIOLOGY","review":"This is a great book not only for radiologists but for all specialists who deal with thoracic diseases: respirologists, thoracic and cardiovascular surgeons and intensivists."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"An unengaging, unendearing tale about five privelidged girls and their &quot;trials&quot; at an East Coast boarding school. Taking place in the early 60s, it's supposed to paint a picture of these pampered young women and the dilemma of a changing society--one where polished social graces and charm are no longer required or respected. Tragic, huh?It's actually the story of spoiled, self-absorbed teenagers. I didn't care about any of them; I was just glad to be finished with them.It really deserves no stars."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Every spare minute I've had in the past month, I've spent with my nose glued to this coming of age tale. I identified with all five characters and found enjoyment in reading about their challenges in transition from adolescence to adulthood. Especially Muffin, who seemed to be the most developed character out of the five girls, whom I most identified with. I was shocked to find out who she married! I did find the writers style to be somewhat confusing as I had minor issues recalling the details of all five characters lives. If the author would have developed each character more and the book would have been a little longer, it would have been a much easier read."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"I began reading this book and was halfway thru it when I began to feel let-down and thought maybe I had missed something. The characters were interesting and many subjects were touched on (such as anorexia, bulimia, being overweight), but somehow these problems were solved without any explanation. One character is described as having bulimia, but in the next chapter she is back to &quot;normal&quot;, and it is never explained or mentioned again! The entire book is like this. Many interesting stories and situations are begun, but just as soon they are brought to an end and I was left frustrated wondering what happened."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"I thought that this novel would consist of more than the day-to-day rituals of an all girls' exclusive school. Based on the rear cover, I expected more on the 1960s and the relative events that would shape the lives of the main characters. In addition to the lack of events, none of the girls are really likable, and come across &quot;cardboard-Like&quot;. What they are is overindulgent and boring!There was no way of knowing through the content of the novel that it was supposed to take place in the sixties. I felt that too much time was spent describing the rules and dress code of the school. These things were mentioned on almost every page! I kept hoping as the book went on that things would turn around, but it never did. Finally, I had to give up and put it down unfinished."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Beth Gutcheon knows how to write and she also knows the world of an all-girls private school, where this novel is set. But there are so many characters in this book, and so much happens in approximately 350 pages that it's hard to remain engaged with the action and the characters. I had to fight the temptation to skip ahead in several parts, because I was bored with whatever was going on with some minor character I could barely remember. Like most authors, Gutcheon has gotten better in time and her later books are much better than this one."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"This novel reminded me of what it was like to go off to a new school. Muffin wanted so much from herself. She wanted to be the popular, beautiful girl. She nurtured a fierce conviction that someday life would give her a chance to show her own unusual self. The story goes through her life at bording school and the changes she begins to see in herself as a young girl growing into a beautiful woman."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"I first read this book right after I graduated high school (over 15 years ago) and I am buying a new copy since the first was read so many times and passed around and finally fell apart! The characters are like best friends. They each have 'something' of someone I knew in high school. Beth Gutcheon wrote a wonderful story with a lot of heart and laughter and tears and life!"},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Based on the reviews I read I decided to buy this book, it was a waste of money. This book has five main characters and it's hard to tell what's going on with whom based on how it's written. There is a lot of profanity and detailed sexual themes in this novel, which I thought were farfetched and unnecessary. The most interesting part of this novel is the end, which describes what happens to the five main characters later in their lives. If you're searching for a good school girl book to read, this is not the one."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"The book was a replacement for one I had lost. I just wish the book had arrived earlier than it did."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"An interesting insight, (fiction though,) on prep schools, wealth, and women in the early 1960's. This book was wonderful! It is a must for any women of any age!"},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Gutcheon's stunning prose and beatiful imagery, as well as her keen sense of humor and drama, make this a really enjoyable book. One of my favorites from this author."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"As a &quot;twenty-something&quot;, it's hard to find books that appeal to my age group. I'm too old for the &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; books, yet too young to be interested in tales of marriage/divorce, children, and mid-life crises. Even though Beth Gutcheon's &quot;The New Girls&quot; centers around teenagers at a prep school, this book is intelligent, deep, and interesting enough for women ages twenty to perhaps eighty. This tale of five friends--Jenny, Ann, Sally, Lisa, and Muffin--will captivate the minds of many personalities. There's a poet, a tomboy, a socialite, a conservative, and even a &quot;nice-to-everyone&quot; in this book. Yet, these five basic personalities evolve into so much more throughout the interesting framework of these chapters. You'll feel like a (lucky) fly on the wall as you mentally join these ladies. You'll get to experience the late night talks in the dorm, the vacations abroad and to Sea Island, first loves, and the occasional naughty smoke in the woods. Beth Gutcheon succeeds with the incredible task of completely developing FIVE characters, and she even reveals the background that each of these girls come from. Another satisfying aspect of the book is the class reunion. When the friends meet up years later (they made a promise while at Miss Pratt's that they would come), the reader finds out just how each girl turned out. So many times, books leave us asking, &quot;What then?&quot; This book won't leave you hanging. You'll know what happened to the New Girls, and you'll be so glad you have the memories....of the girls AND of this captivating novel!!!"},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Having read most of Beth Gutcheon's books, I sat down with this one with high expectations. The book failed to live up to them, but I will say this--it's a page-turner, because you do want to find out what happened to these women.The book opens with four of the five girls back at their boarding school for a reunion. IN the opening chapter, it is revealed that one of the five has committed suicide. For the rest of the novel, you search for clues on why it happened--what drove her to it? YOu also search for clues on what will become of these young women. Unfortunately, the drama doesn't really pay off--you see the girls as adults again the in the final chapter, but it doesn't tell you much about either of these questions.Having followed these girls throughout the book, it would be more interesting to see what became of them than to detail each and every last exploit of their boarding school years. Perhaps the book should have been longer and done that.This is a good book, but unlike &quot;Saying Grace,&quot; &quot;Five Fortunes,&quot; and &quot;Still Missing,&quot; it isn't a great one."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"It was really interesting to read this book about a culture so far from my own, yet the characters so like myself. The author captures what it is like to be a teenage girl perfectly, all the while painting a picture of wealthy America. I would reccommend this book to anyone who has ever been to Summer Camp, College, or anywhere else where friendships are molded through being roommates. This book would speak to you!"},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"....You certainly don't need to be poor and downtrodden and &quot;underpriviledged&quot; to suffer in many and varied ways. I think one point here was a keen illustration of how money can't necessarily buy happiness, and Gutcheon did a superb job of conveying this, among other themes.Loved this book, and loved her newer one &quot;More Than You Know&quot;. I recommend them both highly."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Beth Gutcheon writes in a way that combines the skill and insight of classical writers with the plot and passion of romance novelists. The new girls are depicted so clearly that you share their intense emotions as you eagerly aniticipate what will happen next to these lovely private school ladies. A truly memorable novel!"},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"Entertaining read if flawed. It's chief problem is that it throws it's net too wide - by attempting to cover the formative years of 5 girls in only 347 pages, I finished the novel feeling as though I really didn't know any of them too well. One example: One of the girls, Lisa, suffers from anorexia during her first year at the school. The author goes into adequate detail explaining how Lisa suffered from the disease, but little else. By the Lisa's second year, she has recovered and is no longer anorexic. But the author never tells us how Lisa is able to recover.Some storylines are quite lovely; I am particularly fond of one involving one of the girls, Jenny, who has a brief affair with her teacher. In describing Jenny's feelings, and the teacher's subsequent restraint, the passages are wistful, painful, and wildly romantic. I also enjoyed the descriptions of beach vacations, social dances, and stealing into the woods for cigarettes that are woven through the book. On those occasions, it's a lovely portrayal into the upper-class life of boarding school girls during the sixties. However, if you're looking for a book describing the interplay of the lives of these girls with the outside world at the time (such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War) you won't get much of it here."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"While I enjoyed this book, it wasn't a must-read, impossible-to-put-down kinda story. This is the second novel of Ms. Gutcheon's I've read, (the first being More Than You Know, which is GREAT) and you can tell it's an early effort.The story focuses on 5 'New Girls' as they're called, who all went to the very prestigious Mrs. Pratt's School for Girls (a prep school) in the early 60's. The first chapter starts with their 15 year reunion, where we learn one of the girls has killed herself...the rest of the book tells us about each one's experience during their three years as a Pratt Girl, and their path to finding friendships with one another.I thought the storyline jumped around a little too much. I felt like each girl was a bit incomplete, and wanted more information at a time, instead of the scattered pieces we're given. And there were so many secondary characters that I couldn't keep up. I'd come to a name and have to stop and think about whether or not I was already introduced to this person, or if it's another new character. In my opinion, it probably would have been easier to follow if their had been one less main character, 4 'New Girls' as a opposed to 5. Also, we never find out why the one girl ended up killing herself years later. That was quite a disappointment.Overall, it was a decent book. I don't think it's for everyone, there's really no climatic point in the story. It's pretty much just an account of the day-to-day life of prep school girls, and their wealthy upbringings. Though it wasn't my favorite, I'll definitely read more from this author, I've read her later stuff and it's much improved."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"I took a chance on this book, not being familiar with the author and was very pleased with my choice. Ms. Gutcheon told the story not only from each girl's persepective, but as each would have told it; glossing over parts they found unattractive or not as important. It was as if each girl were remembering her past. And as it is with remembering we don't always remember every detail or what exactly happened next. I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"After being intensely moved by this author's novel More Than You Know, I was gleeful. Aha, a new writer to enjoy! I decided to work my way through her earlier books and started with this one. I think it is her first novel. It feels like one, semi-autobiographical and ridden with remembered angst. Incidents are brought up and then dropped, leaving the reader with a sense of frustration. If I had read this book first, I don't think I would have guessed what a truly fine writer she later turned out to be."},{"Title":"The New Girls","review":"No, no...worse than terrible, it was lazy. This &quot;coming-of-age&quot; novel amounted to little more than a few stick figures plodding (clunky Abercrombies on, of course) through some weary story lines. For an entire weekend, I fought my way through this slough, trying to find something -- anything -- that might make me give a hoot about a single one of these characters. My herculean efforts were thwarted, however, by Ms. Gutcheon. With her painfully stilted writing and penchant for orphaning her characters and their development, Ms. Gutcheon nearly drove me to commit literary hara-kiri. While I sincerly hope that The New Girls is an anomaly and that Ms. Gutcheon really is a talented writer of engrossing novels, Lucifer and his impish pals will be winning Olympic gold in Siberia before I pick up another one of her works."},{"Title":"Mopsa the Fairy","review":"A young boy struggles to return a baby fairy to Fairyland, while his human touch changes her. This is a beautifully crafted book with a sweet message and gorgeous illustrations."},{"Title":"Mopsa the Fairy","review":"I ordered this version based on a review that said it had illustrations. The paperback version does *not* have any. Also, the text layout is poorly designed, with no breaks between chapters. Some of the pages end with the next chapter title and one line of text. It's obvious the publisher did not pay much attention to design. This is essentially a \\"script\\" of the text, all run together, rather than a nice copy of the book. However, this text is typically hard to find except in old library editions, so I am still glad it's being made available again. Just realize that if you decide to buy it, it will not be a \\"nice\\" version."},{"Title":"Mopsa the Fairy","review":"Since shortly after I met my wife, I had heard references to Mopsa the Fairy, one of her favorite books, but I didn't actually read it, for myself or to my four now-grown children. Not until my youngest turned five did I actually read it, and now I'm sorry that I waited so long. The little guy loved it, and so do I.Mopsa is a fairy, but don't presume you know what that means. Among other things, it means that as an infant, she is in danger of being eaten by a ferret. It means that she grows through childhood and adolescence like a human child -- but that may take only a few days. And it means that as an adult, she is a queen in the sense that some bees and ants are queens, and had better find herself a nest of her own before the local queen has to kill her.All of this comes as a surprise to Jack, a human boy who takes her under his protection (and she needs it -- see above about predation upon fairy babies), but that is far from the only aspect of the fairy realm that is surprising and confusing to Jack, and Mopsa is not the only one endangered. Not to worry, though -- Jack returns to the mortal world alive and sound, although I would not say unharmed."},{"Title":"Mopsa the Fairy","review":"Ooooh, Mopsa The Fairy is a WONDERFUL, magical, childhood-mysteries book, in the old-fashioned English genre of the more serious, almost-reality-flavored, \\"it could happen in the blink of an eye\\" fantasy... not in the cutesy, bland, predictable, \\"pastel-bunny and stupid voices\\" habits of modern childrens' story pap and supposed \\"fairy tale\\" representations, but in the broader, darker, more possibility-expansive and dreamlike wonderings of what could happen in this world of INFINITE ideas and realities. It's old-fashioned, of course, and that brings such yummy nostalgia as more graciousness, tenderer subtleties, a quaint and respectful formality, more nuanced colors (charming yet also sometimes somehow vaguely disturbing images), lending immeasurably to its story's twists and turns...There are actually many free versions online... often b&w-illustrated...; but THE BEST ONE -- to me -- is the 1910 version (with a red cover) I read as a child, which contains glorious and quirky images in lovely vintage color (by Maria L. Kirk), on the Univ. of Pennsylvania Libraries, \\"A Celebration of Women Writers\\" website, at [...]This is a classic to own -- but if you want the full and satisfying experience, do not purchase any paperback... you will not get near the advantages, images, or the thrill of this juicy reading opportunity.Oh, yeah, this is what fairy tales are really all about..."},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"Michelle Stacey's book, THE FASTING GIRL, is a lucid and compelling examination of the life of Mollie Fancher, a young Victorian woman who, after a streetcar accident in 1865, manifested bizarre physical symptoms including weakness, various paralyses, and apparent blindness and claimed to live twelve years without food. Because newspaper and other reporters picked up Mollie's story, celebrated her, and made her famous, Ms Stacey has been able to document the bizarre occurances in Molly's life which might seem too improbable to consider from a less diligent researcher. Ms Stacey's research is unimpeachable.She describes Mollie's life in transfixing detail and presents alternative possible realities of Mollie's claims for twenty-first-century readers. I think anyone would like this book, but especially readers interested in the psychology of Victorian &quot;hysteria,&quot; which today would probably be the companion of philosophers' &quot;mind-body connection,&quot; physicians' &quot;psycosomatics,&quot; and neuroscientists' relatively new field of &quot;psychoneuroimmunology;&quot; in other words, what your mind can, however improbably, make your body do without your knowledge or consent.I love this book. Fascinating stuff and a romping good read!"},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"Michelle Stacey's The Fasting Girl (A True Victorian Medical Mystery) tells the fascinating story of Mollie Fancher of Brooklyn who, after a fall from a streetcar, becomes a bed-ridden invalid until the end of her life. The facts that make this case so very interesting are that this particular invalid claimed not to have eaten for at least twelve years, have clairavoyant powers, and been able to read despite being (hysterically) blind. These attributes connect her with a larger history outside her bedroom. The author takes the story back into the past with the medieval fasting saints and into the present with anorexia nervosa girls. The story, at its most interestng, winds its way through many aspects of the nineteenth century, including science, relgion, philosophy, and spirtuality. The author often tackles the subject more as a journalist than a historian, skimming the surface. It is still a fun and enjoyable ride through the nineteenth century as seen through the life of one very celebrated invalid."},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"This was a very different book...with different meaning in a good way. Stacey did a tremendous amount of research into both the family of Mollie Fancher, and the times in which she lived. Just as in a hundred years when people read about the predominance of anorexia nervosa, they will not totally understand the mechanisms and stressors behind girls of our time literally starving themselves to death...we cannot possibly understand the workings of Mollie Fancher's decisions to alter the controls of her own life without understanding the immense pressures she was under. There is this prevailing concept now that things were 'easier in the good old days' because our own world is so complex and often so violent. Yet, we too quickly forget that the 'old days' including frequent deaths by bear children, terrible diseases that took the lives of children who lived past the first year and adults, crowded and polluted conditions in cities, and total lack of respect for women as shown in how little say they had in their own lives.Mollie had experienced almost all of these things by the time she reached sixteen. From a middle class family, she lost her mother early to childbirth, she had lost brothers/sisters to disease, her father remarried and abandoned the original family (which seemed to happen a lot according to my eugenics research), Mollie was fast approaching the age where she would be required to leave school, and marry and have children. The final straw was getting her long skirts entangled in a street car upon leaving it, and getting dragged for a long period of time.Stacey makes it clear that the decisions Mollie made to remain bedridden were probably not consciously overt decisions. Mollie must have retained a phobia concerning childbirth after seeing what it did to her beloved mother, and she was given a pretty good education only to be expected to submerge that education and her independence upon marriage. By choosing to invalid herself, she managed to retain some control over her own life...but at costs not only to others like her family who had to take care of her, but also to herself. Mollie was not a traditional anorexic as we are familiar with all too well these days. She may have gone through an early stage of fasting and food avoidance, but her invalidism did not have a significant effect on her length of life. Her photos look like she was fairly well-fed and at middle life, was heavy as so many of us women get. The mystery in this book is not concerned as much with the claim by others mainly that she lived on relatively little food. She may have not eaten a lot, but being bed-ridden with no exercise would certainly not have demanded that she eat a lot to retain a decent figure of health. The real mystery has to do with the reaction of society towards Mollie, the scientists who fought to prove she was a 'fake' though she was relatively uninterested in celebrity, and the absolute fascination that the press and society with Mollie's abilities and her problems.That Mollie was fooling herself is discernible in Stacey's fine writing. That others allowed Mollie's sure belief in herself to close their own eyes to reality is also obvious. As usual, scientists (usually minor ones too) were quick to jump on any available media soapbox to promote their own 'scientific' ideas against any possible spiritual reason for Mollie's continued existence. Not much has changed in 140 years. Scientists are still jumping on any available media soapbox to promote their ideas...and the quacks with their speculations, unproven theories, risky practices, and self-conceit are all around us again (including some Nobel prize winners who make ridiculous statements to the press!).I found the history of all this incredibly fascinating. Stacey wandered a bit from Mollie's story, yet the wanderings were interesting and added to the general understanding of Mollie's frame of mind, as well as that of the scientists and her own rabid supporters. One thing this book does it make you look at your own beliefs and prejudices to see if they hold up under inspection.I remember 'hearing' that anorexics were using food as both an attention-getter and as a power struggle within the family and society. To an extent, I think the power theory has validation, but I no longer believe that these girls (and occasionally men) do this as an attention getter. They are actually the opposite...sneaky, trying to avoid eating at all costs, using any means to void the body of nutritional benefit. These people truly do not understand after a certain point their own self-destructive behavior. Though Mollie may not have been a traditional anorexic, she also did not totally understand her own unconscious decisions...because in letters and statements she had made to others it is clear she 'missed' being able to do certain things. Karen Sadler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"This book has a ton of interesting information regarding Victorian America, and the stressors that came with the fast-changing times. The author obviously did extensive and in depth research regarding this book, which contributes to the vast amount of fact and well-drawn conclusions included in the book. However, it seems that the text does not flow well because there is too much information. In reading this book, I felt that the author included all the research she found, without recognizing that some could have been saved for another project. Initially, I expected the focus of the book to be about Mollie Fancher, but she is just a starting place for a dissertation on the origin of modern diagnoses of neuroses. The book is very interesting, yet did not hold my attention as I had hoped."},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"In the late 1800's, a girl named Mollie Fancher became a strange sort of celebrity when she purportedly went over 12 years on nothing more than a few sips of milk and a small banana following a bizarre horsecar accident. She never again left her bed, and in doing so became known as the \\"Brooklyn Enigma.\\"Although this book is a nonfiction account of Miss Fancher's life and celebrity, Michelle Stacey writes it as if it was a mystery novel. She gives just enough information to entice the reader to the next chapter, interspersing the details of Mollie's life with background information on the Victorian era, early Brooklyn, and the history of neurosis.Despite the enthralling nature of the subject, Stacey's writing sometimes drags. The reader finds herself wondering why we need to know this particular piece of information and whether we'll be getting back to the point anytime soon.In light of this, however, I would still recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good medical mystery. Unfortunately, Mollie died before revealing the secret behind her 14 year fast, so this mystery must remain one for the ages."},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"A little bit dry in places. Would have liked more detail on her day to day life. Also sometimes assumed I knew more about the case than I do."},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"Stacey takes a good cross-section of Victorian media and filters it through the lens of Mollie Fancher. Basically her claim is that only in the 1870s could a phenomenon like Mollie transpire: it was a time when the nature of the soul and the nature of mental illness were being reexamined and redefined. The author takes a number of disparate threads and ideas and ties them together quite effectively; unfortunately she examines each concept one at a time, in mini-biographies of other men only peripherally related to the Fancher case, and it's hard to see where she's going until the end. She almost lost me more than once, but I'm glad I stayed with it.For further reading about 19th century medicine, sociology and/or Spiritualism, try \\"Other Powers\\" by Barbara Goldsmith, or \\"Bleed, Blister and Purge: A History of Medicine on the American Frontier\\" by Volney."},{"Title":"The Fasting Girl","review":"\\"One can't believe impossible things.\\"\\"I daresay you haven't had much practice,\\" said the Queen. \\"When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day.

They in fact took to this belief with a fervor usually reserved for predictions about the end of the world--- give away all of your property and come sit in this cave to wait for it to happen.And the author has done a lot of research into the state of the nerves of America in the last half of the 19th century-- bad, very bad. But it's the application of the research to the case of Mollie Francher that hits a bump in the road.Did she have multiple personalities? Was she a hysteric? Did she suffer from chlorosis? Neuresthenia? Anorexia Nervosa? Take your pick. There is support for all of these. She could twist herself into shapes that would have astonished the exocist, lay for weeks and months in a trance, claimed to be completely blind while turning out fancy work-- sold in a shop on the ground floor of her home, and displayed what appeared to be psychic abilities.It was very interesting to read about the birth pangs of psychiatry and the personalities who midwived it. Chlorosis (green sickness) and neuresthenia seemed similar in description to modern chronic fatigue syndrome.

By \\"visual\\" the author appears to mean live electronic imaging as opposed to time-exposure images.In particular, this book is about using the Collins I3 image intensifier, by itself and in conjunction with a Stellacam II. I've never seen any mention of the I3 image intensifier, so if you have this gadget the book is probably one you should have.There's a little on the Stellacam II, but really you would do better withDeep-Sky Video Astronomy (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)Here it's exclusively paired with the I3.The author includes a lot of other general information about packing up for a trip to a dark site and includes photos (captured via Stellacam) of what you can see with his giant Dobsonian. But the writing style is pretty wordy and the photos are not very exciting.So I rate this as a kind of niche book, not something for the general reader.For more on this technology, see the Collins website at [...], as of Jan. 2012 they're showing a price tag of $3000 for the I3 image intensifier!"},{"Title":"From Mt Krizevac to Mt Carmel: A Medjugorje Pilgrim's Conversion","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this.

If I were to rate this book, I would give it: (out of ten stars)Creativity: **********Interest: **********Excitement: **********Action: **********Overall: **********/**********Age minimum: 10 years old"},{"Title":"The Ghost at Skeleton Rock (Hardy Boys, Book 37)","review":"In quite a few books in this series Chet Morton's hobbies either are important to solving the mystery, or they lead to a mystery. Such is the case in this story. Chet is learning to become a ventriloquist, and he has saved enough money to purchase a dummy. However, it appears that dummies are very popular and Chet has a difficult time buying one. In a shop that has a dummy to sell, two men take a dummy that Chet is about to purchase at gunpoint! Fortunately, the proprietor has another dummy in stock.Chet's dummy is damaged by accident, and suddenly the mystery becomes more complex when the boys discover raw diamonds in the dummy's glass eyes. The mystery continues to increase in complexity and danger when an extra suitcase containing a bomb appears on the Hardys' new plane. The boys also learn that the gang includes a member who looks a lot like Joe Hardy. The resemblance between the criminal and Joe will cause Frank and Joe difficulties throughout this mystery.The mystery leads to Puerto Rico, where the boys encounter the criminals time and again, and yet seem to have difficulties learning what the criminals are up to, only that there is something sinister and complicated going on. Eventually the boys travel to a remote island where the natives are clearly restless, and where the huge ghost of skeleton rock lives. Soon after the story reaches its climax and the Hardys, Chet Morton and Tony Prito solve all the mysteries, including one involving a group of revolutionaries.I thought the most intriguing part of this story occurred early on, when Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton were trying to figure out what was going on with the dummy and the diamonds. After everyone went to Puerto Rico the story seemed to get a little weaker. The story also dates itself because the story describes Carib Indians that appear to be living a very archaic life. Given the size of the island and its location, it seems unlikely that the Indians were indeed Carib and it seems unlikely that they would still exist in the same condition today.I find myself conflicted about this Hardy Boys mystery. The story had good portions, but there were also portions that left me wondering what the author was thinking. I happened to be reading another book about Puerto Rico at about the same time, \\"The Happy Hollisters at Lizard Cove,\\" and I noticed the same lack of attention to detail. While I am prepared to forgive a few errors, this time the author appeared lazy and that decreased my reading pleasure. However, I am determined to read all the Hardy Boys books, regardless of their quality. If I had the ability, I think I would have given this story three and a half stars.The publisher recommends the Hardy Boys series for ages 9 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. This particular book is a good fit for the new age range. Though the Hardy Boys series contains archaic information, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are good. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Ghost at Skeleton Rock (Hardy Boys, Book 37)","review":"The main setting is San Juan that is a capital in Puerto Rico. Calypso Island is north of Puerto Rico. The story starts in the United States in a city called Bayport. Calypso Island is little and covered with shrubbery. It is small enough that an Indian tribe, a mansion and a hill just fits on it. San Juan is a town. Bayport is a big city by a bay. Most of the story takes place on Calypso Island.Frank is dark haired, smart, brave, and clever. He is also alert, athletic, investigative, eager, and anxious. He wants to be like his Dad. His dad is a detective for the police department. Frank gets clues and organizes them. He talks with his brother, Joe who helps him solve mysteries. A few more things that describe Frank are detail oriented, a sometimes overactive mind, and self -confidence.At the beginning of the story, Frank was mostly a happy person. He was taking flying lessons and being with his brother. Frank was a little frustrated when he first got the clues to the mystery. He was eager to get some more clues to solve the mystery. It was exciting for him to help solve the mystery. He wanted to be like his dad the detective for the police. He was smart to find the bad guy in the phonebook. He felt important after he found two of the criminals. Frank was a little scared when the bad guy started shooting at their plane. He was a bit smarter after he solved the mystery. He felt good about himself.At the beginning of the book, Frank and his brother, Joe, were sent a secret coded letter from their father. The letter said &quot;Hugo Purple Turban.&quot; The boys looked for all the &quot;Hugos&quot; in the phone book. The boys were interested in finding the &quot;Hugo&quot; that stole some handbags. One of the Hugos had a purple turban. The boys went to investigate where handbag robberies occurred. They followed the suspects for a long time. They heard a clue. It was &quot;Cabezona&quot;, which means pineapple. Before the brothers left for San Juan, their friends Chet and Tony found a ticking suitcase in the cargo hold. Frank said it was a bomb and threw it as far as he could. Then Frank, Joe, Chet, and Tony went to San Juan.When they got to San Juan all the boys saw Frank and Joe's father. The brothers went to the airport. Frank went into one of the airplane's cargo area. The plane took off with Frank still in the cargo hold. He almost ran out of air but he didn't die. Joe was waiting at the airport for Frank. Frank and Joe went to a pineapple orchard because of the &quot;Cabezona&quot; clue. When they were there, someone pushed them off the edge of the 50-foot railing. Frank held Joe from falling any further. He held them till help came.Then they went North of Cabezona and found the island called Calypso. They found a mansion on the island. Someone greeted them and gave them lobster dinner. It was lightly poisoned, but not enough to kill a person. Chet got a big stomachache. Tony had a small stomachache but Frank and Joe were fine. They went to get Chet some medicine. When they got back, the man said Chet and Tony went for a walk. Frank and Joe went to find them. They found a tribe of Indians. The Indians almost fed them to the sharks. Frank and Joe found Chet, Tony and their father, tied up in an underground chamber. Then they fought the criminals. The Indians helped fight. After the bad guys were arrested the Hardys got a medal, Tony got a speedboat, and Chet got a ventriloquism doll. They earned the boat, ventriloquism doll, and the medals because they helped solve a big mystery.I like reading this Hardy Boys book because I like mysteries. I felt like I was in the book and I was Frank. In some of the parts I felt excited. When Frank found some diamonds, I felt like I wanted to read some more. I think you should read this book also."},{"Title":"The Ghost at Skeleton Rock (Hardy Boys, Book 37)","review":"Hello my name is Aaron Fitzgerald and I am writing this review for my Literature class at school. This book number 37 in a great series is about 2 boys named Frank(16) and Joe(17) Hardy who solve mysteries. Together with the help of friends and family together solve international crimes. They have been on many perilous journies around the world together in search of mystery and danger. If you really enjoy a good mystery/danger book with plenty of action then read on to find out more about the book.In the beginning of the book Frank and Joe recieve a message from their father(also a detective)that reads 'Find Hugo purple turban'. So they found a man named Hugo who had an assistant that wore a puple turban. Unfortunately the Hardy boys got tied up by Hugo and his assistant(Abdul)and they criminals escaped. Later when they went to buy a ventriloquist dummy it had a puple turban. Later after investigating the dummy they found uncut diamonds in the eyes.

In this book Frank and Joe Hardy investigate smuglers that leads them to islands in the Caribbean. The investigation starts when their friend Chet goes to buy a ventriloquist dummy. Frank and Joe find diamonds in the eyes which lead them to several suspects. They track them to Tropicale and find out even more about them. All the while the smuglers are tryin to catch them. The main characters are Frank, Joe, and Fenton Hardy and also Chet Morton. The Hardys are detectives from Bayport and Chet is their friend. Frank, Joe, and Chet are in high school. This story takes place in Bayport, and in the Caribbean. This is a mystery/adventure that will make you not want to put it down. It is very fast paced which is good for young boys that really dont like to read that much will like it. It is pretty similar to the other Hardy books because of the adventure and mystery. It is different because they are mainly by themselves and they have to deal with natives of the island. The style is third person point of view which is good because it keeps u wondering whats going to happen next. I really liked this book and I didnt want to put it down.

A revision of \\"The Melted Coins\\" written in 1970. I thought - boring title - boring book. I glanced at the back cover and after scouring the title wondered why I wasn't given The Ghost at Skeleton Rock. Surely that volume dealing with ghosts would be scary and a great read. When I finally read this volume I was greatly let down. Perhaps the best titled book in the canon - it does not live up to fascinating title. The brothers don't arrive at Skeleton Rock until the final two chapters basically and the ghost winds up being some air stuffed windbag. There was no suspense. The Hardys certainly weren't afraid. I yawned through the whole thing myself. This was the first volume cut from 200+ pages to roughly 180 pages. The cover art was definately not among Rudi Nappi's best. The brothers in this one seem more like FBI undercover agents than amateur teenage detectives. As I said - a very big disapointment.

During the last ten years his writing skills declined due to poor health and opium addiction; some of his later novels are really bad (semi-theatrical melodramas). Surprisingly 'The Haunted Hotel', one of the last works by Wilkie Collins, is a rather nice, compact ghost story. Fans of Wilkie Collins will be pleased.The story is about, um.., a haunted hotel. Several characters, mostly squabbling aristocrats, return to the Venetian home (now hotel) of a deceased colleague (..a rather nasty fellow). The past comes to haunt these guests in rather metaphysical ways. It's all a bit silly, of course. But the decent prose and characterizations save 'The Haunted Hotel' from being some camp ghost story.Bottom line: certainly not a classic but enjoyable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"I usually like a book like this, but found this one very boring.There was no \\"hotel\\" until over half way through the book and there was no 'haunting' untilalmost 75% of the way through.Just bored me to tears.."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"i found myself having to resist the urge to put it down before finishing a chapter. the plot is unclear in the beginning.

It plods along without getting to the exciting parts of the story. I set it aside to go back to later. I am glad that it was a free book."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"As with many other Wilkie Collins novels, The Haunted Hotel has elements of fate, romance, danger, deception, murder and mystery. The story begins with Lord Montbarry breaking off his engagement to Anges Lockwood. Countess Narona, who will marry Lord Montbarry, comes to see a doctor to evaluate her sanity. The Countess seems to be under a good deal of stress about this marriage, as she was unaware Montbarry had already been engaged. There is an aura of fatalism about the Countess, as she feels an impending sense of dread about this situation. However, the marriage goes through, and it seems that the Countess and Agnes Lockwood will cross paths several times. When a mysterious death takes place a bit later, followed by a disappearance of equal mystery, then things get more complicated. Fate seems to beckon all key characters to an ill-fated hotel with one seriously spooky room.The novel's conclusion, where all is unraveled in the denouement, is probably the most effective part of the book and mystery to the plot. As always, Collins knows how to put everything together in amazing fashion and hold our interest by delaying major plot developments. This makes the final few chapters quite compelling, as we await the fates of key characters and the mysteries involved with the hotel. I also really enjoyed the \\"book within a book\\" approach that Collins utilizes as a key component in the mystery.Still, I think that several of Collins longer books are much more effective at creating a well-timed pacing and building the appropriate amount of suspense and tension. The pacing for The Haunted Hotel seems to be off, with long bouts of romance and trivial developments in the first half that stall the story. At these moments where we learn a bit of the background the plot moves at a plodding pace, with no sense of tension or real drive to get going anywhere. It is only when several character motives are in plain view, and when the hotel becomes the focus, that the suspense takes off and heads to a fitting conclusion."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"One would wonder how the book was received upon its inception, way then. Perhaps mentalities were different ; perhaps people were more credulous then. Because this is not a very good book. As a matter of fact, this is verging on a very bad book. It is nicely written but the story is nave and not credible in the least. If you do have an interest in the writings of Wilkie Collins, perhaps \\"The Moonstone\\" would be a better choice.I wouldn't have given it any star at all, but I haven't figured out how to do so..."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"This is another great book by Wilkie Collins ,although it starts slowly and drags a little until it begins to be very good ,I think this is due to setting the stage for the really great stuff later on. I think this book comes very close to the drama of The Woman in White, a great read and doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"This was a fun read!Written around the late 1870's, it's a mysterious tale with a hint of the supernatural.The story is woven around around both the old and the young between the cities of Londonand Venice. Mr. Collins keeps the pace moving by revealing small pieces of the mysteryat a time and then reeling the reader in with them.I thought that this tale would lean more towards the supernatural side, but the mysterywas well conceived and told and I enjoyed myself anyway.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"This is the first Wilkie Collins book I've ever read, so I can't compare it to others. However, it stood very well on its own as a classic horror/mystery. The writing style is surprisingly modern considering that it was written in the Victorian period, aside from a few roundabout descriptions of sensitive details. The plot itself, though, didn't hold back any punches. The content and style reminded me of Poe.The characters were more archetypes than drawn from life, but that's what I expected from a Victorian horror story anyway. I liked the little insights into Victorian life (what travel was like, \\"the post,\\" doctor's visits) but more than anything else just enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"If you don't have any other reading to do on a rainy day, I would recommend this book. It was a quick read. I did figure out the truth before Collins actually revealed it, but that sometimes happens. Do I think the hotel is haunted? Was it a true ghost story? Not really. It's more murder mystery than ghostly."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"This novel was originally published in 1879, and is still readable today. It does have a nice plot twist, but suffers, as much writiing of that period does, from little sense of urgency. Life was more slowly paced and people had more time to smell the roses.To my thinking, 130 years after the author wrote it, the transitions are somewhat clumsy, and there could be a lot more drama in the story. But allowance has to be given for the era in which it was written. In those days women were delicate flowers, although the Countess is memorable as an exception to the mold.I was surprised that there was so little detail of Venice where much of the story takes place. In fact the subtitle is \\"A Mystery Of Modern Venice.\\"If you collect antiques, this might delight you. For the rest of us, it is a worthy reminder of whence the murder mystery derived."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"When I first came across The Haunted Hotel, I figured the main theme of the book would be a hotel with a few ghosts roaming down the halls. There IS a ghost in this book, but the ghost takes a back seat to the mystery behind the life and death of a man named Lord Montbarry.Lord Montbarry was engaged to marry a lovely young lady named Agnes Lockwood. His family found her pleasing and quite approved of the match. Suddenly, Montbarry terminated the engagement and married a woman of questionable reputation, Countess Narona. Although heart broken, Agnes remained brave while the newlyweds honeymooned in Venice.The novel really begins to take off when Agnes receives a desperate plea from a woman she once knew to allow her to use her name as a reference for her husband, who wishes to apply for a job as a courier in the service of Lord Montbarry! Agnes finds the request offensive but agrees under strict rules.Later, Agnes receives another frantic visit from the woman. Lord Montbarry's new courier has gone missing. No one associated with him have a clue what happened to him. Lady Montbarry herself states the courier vanished into thin air. The next time the woman visits Agnes, she is convinced her husband is dead. She received a letter from Lord Montbarry's deathbed which contains one thousand pounds.The novel is dark and creepy, especially Lady Montbarry with her wild black eyes and her strange prophecies of \\"the end\\". When Agnes and Lord Montbarry's family travel to Venice and stay at the infamous haunted hotel, where Lord Montbarry once lived, the mystery behind the courier and Montbarry finally fall into place. Definitely WC's most creepy novel!"},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"The fine art of writing a good mystery is to so intrigue the reader that, ponderings of the plot and characters lingering in the mind, draw him/her continually to the story with a hunger for the conclusion that exeeds any other diversion. Such was my experience with this story. Having read The Moonstone and Woman in White by the same author, I expected a quality read. I was not disappointed. A sense of impending doom amid Victorian gothic ambience is painted in the first pages when we are introduced to the Countess Narona, an enigmatic beauty with a soul possessed of a magnetic enchantment and an inner terror that draws the reader immediately into the haunting dark destiny she seeks so desperately to escape. The unfolding of the end at the hotel in \\"modern\\" Venice THE HAUNTED HOTEL A MYSTERY OF MODERN VENICEis chilling."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"I came to hear of Wilkie Collins when doing some research on Charles Dickens. The two were friends and I had heard good things about Collins, so I decided to read one. I read, The Woman in White, which I really liked (but didn't get around to reviewing). Collins is purported to be the first to write English detective novels (and I feel lazy, so I won't be looking this up, so you are on your own for that!) and I have to say, I'm a big fan. Huge!In this particular mystery, Agnes is betrothed to Lord Montbarry, but he ends up jilting her for the Countess Narona. Agnes is the picture of a good soul. Instead of being a shrieking, insane jilted woman, she has taken the high road and forgiven both for their transgressions against her. Lucky for us, her nurse hasn't, which does provide some comic relief for the reader.Now, the Lord and his new Lady are going on their honeymoon, and her brother will be meeting up with them in Italy. All is well, except for the little fact that the Countess doesn't necessarily have the best reputation and the Lord's family utterly detests her. The Lord falls ill while in Venice, and the courier whom Agnes has recommended has suddenly disappeared, leaving his wife quite distraught. The mystery thickens as whisperings abound, and suddenly the Lord is dead. The Countess is to come into quite a sum of money to support her brother (and honestly, no wonder people talked about the two of them pretending to be brother and sister, Collins has the Countess maintain until the end that they are, but there is still sufficient doubt, in my mind at least.)Needless to say, the family of the Late Lord Montbarry is distraught, but an upcoming wedding and the opening of a sibling's hotel provides a reason to go to Italy and meet up with the happy couple a month into their honeymoon. And here is where the plot thickens: the family members of the late Lord Montbarry have strange reactions to a room in the hotel, and then, the discovery!Now, of course I can't really tell you much more, except to say that I am really loving Collins' books. I think I will be going on a Collins bender over the summer, but we'll see, as I have quite the stack of books to get through before the Fall!"},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"Reading a novel by Wilkie Collins requires substantial time, but my investment is usually well rewarded. His lesser known novel, The Haunted Hotel, is uncharacteristically short, and is an easy way to become acquainted with Wilkie Collins. The Haunted Hotel offers a fast moving, tight plot that maintains the reader's interest. It is a mystery story, a ghost story, and an early psychological thriller, all melded smoothly together.The story begins in London, but later moves to the modern Venice of 1860. The dark, wet waterways and aging palaces provide an ideal setting for a mysterious death and a possibly related disappearance. Suspicion there is, but evidence is sparse. A threatening apparition indirectly hints at further clues.The psychology component revolves around the Countess Narona, one of the most memorable characters created by Collins. The seemingly amoral Countess foresees, or believes she foresees, her eventual punishment and doom for previous evils. Her obsession leads her step by step toward the very retribution that she hopes to avoid.The Haunted Hotel - A Mystery of Modern Venice was first published in 1879. I recommend buying the inexpensive Dover edition (ISBN 0486243338). Dover also reprints other books by Wilkie Collins, including The Moonstone, The Lady in White, The Dead Secret, Basil, No Name, and others. Through these works Wilkie Collins is credited with having popularized the classic detective mystery story."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"If you are a Wilkie Collins fan, well then, add this title to your list. I have. A story filled with suspenses and mystery. It keeps you turning the pages until the end. Who killed the count or did anyone? What happened to the courier? Is the countess mad? Told partly by letters and differing characters' perspective it is typical of Collins' narrative style. He takes the readers to a most stupendous climax in Venice. It is a ghost story, a fun read, like watching an old black and white movie. Recommeded!"},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"Wilkie Collins, who wrote such landmark (and lengthy) mysteries as &quot;The Moonstone&quot; and &quot;The Woman in White,&quot; has a very short effort, too. &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot; is that effort. As mysteries go, this one is rather understated, though one must make allowances for the fact that it was written in 1878, long before Christie, Carr, and others gave the genre a more definite shape. (One must also make allowances for the sexism contained in the book lest one hurl the book at the nearest wall, window, or other suitable repository.)The story begins when a man and woman become engaged. Sadly, though, he was already engaged. His first fiancee very graciously bows out, and the man marries his second fiancee. They head to Venice, where their stay in a castle is marked by mystery. A maid quits. A porter then disappears without a trace. Finally, the man dies. All of these events lead toward a series of coincidences that draws the many characters together for a final revelation.The story, though, is more a melodrama than a mystery. Indeed, the mystery is subverted for much of the story as the characters' lives overlap, collide, and generally run into each other. It is easy, amid this seeming chaos, to lose sight of the second fiancee, a fascinating character who is so dominated by her sense of fate and supernatural vengeance that she causes events for which she later blames Fate. Unfortunately, she is the most interesting character and is absent from too much of the story. She alone seems to break free of the rather confining roles imposed on the others by the times and the culture. In a longer book, her absences might be a source of great consternation, but the reader who pushes through the first 80 or so pages will be well rewarded in the last 50, where she reclaims center stage and where the mystery also comes to the fore."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"The book's real strength lies in the character of the villainess/ victim Countess. As in Armadale, Collins creates a female character capable of enormous evil,and at the same time so riddled with guilt,and so seemingly trapped by her destiny, that we feel a horrified sympathy for her from the off.None of the rest of the book's characters really come up to the same level, but the plotting as always is excellent, and the variation on the 'substitution' device in 'Woman' marks another first in crime fiction, which has been ripped off ad infinitum. The ending is truly chilling; if the hero(s) and heroine had had a bit more blood in them, this would rank with the very best."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"I have very much enjoyed the works of Wilkie Collins that I have read, so happily downloaded the free Kindle version of The Haunted Hotel.Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the main female and male characters. The main female is just too perfect and everyone loves her. Bleah.However, I think the Countess redeems the story. As she describes herself, a woman of good and evil (i.e., an actual character). Watching her mental state as the story evolves is quite interesting, and how she reveals what happened in Venice is certainly one of the more unusual ways.Is Room 14 haunted? Considering this is a Victorian novel, it very well might be.Give it a try if you like Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"This classic ghost story is part mystery and part psychological/character study. The point of view in the story jumps from character to character as the complex plot unfolds. Modern readers may be a little put off by the way characters in the story seem a little condescending towards the women involved, but that's really the only criticism that I have of the book.The story begins with the enigmatic Countess Narona seeking a doctor's opinion in London upon whether or not she is losing her sanity. The doctor says that he can find nothing wrong with her, but the Countess is rather disturbed in her mind over her impending marriage to Lord Montbarry. At the time she became engaged to him, she was unaware that he had already been engaged to another woman, a cousin of his. Although he and the cousin have more or less amicably broken off their engagement, the Countess still feels guilty about her engagement to this man, particularly when she has a chance encounter with his former fiance, Agnes. Agnes seems like such a sweet, likeable girl that the Countess says that she makes her feel her own wickedness, and now she has a horrible sense of impending doom that will be brought down on her by Agnes in punishment for her sins.In spite of her misgivings and the disapproval of Lord Montbarry's family, who think that she is merely a fortune-hunter, she proceeds with her marriage, and she and her new husband leave the country in the company of the Countess's brother, Baron Rivar. Later, word reaches the family that Lord Montbarry has died of bronchitis in Venice. His widow, the Countess, receives a regular allowance as part of his will and a good amount of money from his life insurance. The Lord's title and most of his estate pass to one of his younger brothers, and the family hopes that they will never hear from the Countess again. However, much as the Countess herself is anxious to avoid them, particularly Agnes, circumstances and the Countess's own premonitions (or, perhaps, sense of guilt) bring them all together again in Venice, at the scene of Lord Montbarry's death. All is not as it first appears, and both the dead and the living will not rest easy until the truth is known."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"When I purchased this book I was hoping for a \\"detective\\" novel, as Wilkie Collins is considered the father of the English detective novel. His novel \\"The Moonstone\\" is his most famous for this reason. However, the storyline to \\"The Haunted Hotel\\" sounded more interesting to me than \\"The Moonstone\\" so I bought it instead.If you're hoping to read a detective novel, don't buy this. There isn't an ounce of detection, logic or even an understanding of human nature in this work. Nor is there any significant character development of any kind. On the other hand, if you like Gothic literature and don't care a jot about character development, buy the novel and godspeed. This IS a page turner, but almost everything about this novel is so predictably facile that it almost doesn't bear reading.My advice is that if you want something serious, steer clear of this one. If you need a brain candy alternative to TV, this is probably a good bet."},{"Title":"The Haunted Hotel","review":"...This little volume contains enough suspense, fog, and familial twists-and-turns to satisfy any modern mystery fan (if one overlooks the inherent sexism that dates this book)...not to mention the delicious sense of voyeurism in peeking in on this group of gentle Englishfolk.

Robbins' intensity and commitment almost physically jump out at the reader, urging you to wake up, take control and massively improve the quality of your life and those around you. I bought this 5 or 6 years ago and continue to dip into it every so often to shake myself up a bit. Just about every page contains an immediately applicable suggestion or strategy for changing your life for the better.Is it all as straightforward as he describes? My view would be yes... and no! Sometimes no amount of focusing and mind control can change some of our deep-rooted patterns? But this book is still brilliant. Many of the ideas here have improved my life.Some of the ideas and techniques are very simple, some far more complicated. The concentrated power of the writing is sustained throughout as Robbins continuously emphasizes the need to commit to lasting change. Early on he suggests the importance of decisions - your decisions about what to focus on, your decisions about what things mean to you, and your decisions about what to do to create the results you desire. He distinguishes between being those who are interested in personal change and those who actually commit to making things happen.Raise your standards, change your limiting beliefs, change your strategy. Ask yourself empowering questions such as &quot;what is great about this problem?&quot; or &quot;what am I excited about in my life right now?&quot;. There is a brilliant chapter on &quot;transformational vocabulary&quot; in which the author suggests that merely by changing the words we regularly use we can profoundly change our reality. As with many of the suggestions in this book, I have tried this and it works, especially if you keep working at it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Trite and simplistic. That is how I would characterize the ideas presented in this common sense journal. There is nothing new or ground breaking here, merely a rehash of dated ideas presented in Tony's awkward writing style. As some one who was caught up in the self help genre I can tell you from personal experience that this stuff will not produce lasting change or measurable improvement in your life. I know, I still suffer from the same emotional problems that I had when I embarked on my quest for personal improvement eight years ago, and I have pretty much read all the self help gurus...Chopra, Robbins, Covey and Scott Peck. It was entertaining but NOT life changing. What a sad commentary.Also bear in mind that may of these gurus lead incredible double lives. Mr. Robbins for instance recently divorced his wife of 15 years. Nothing particularly shocking about divorce, but after going on and on endlessly in his books about how great his marriage was and how his simple little techniques could be used to fix any relationship problems I must say it came as a bit of a surprise. Why, did'nt he do enough swish patterns...not enough neuro associative conditioning, Tony? Or maybe he lost his &quot;motivation&quot; for his wife ? My point is this stuff really does not work, neither for its authors nor for the suckers who are gullibe enough to buy it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I bought this book for a couple of dollars at a second hand bookstore and after taking it home and reading it decided to bring it back to the second hand bookstore and see if they could resell it.After hearing all the hype on Robbins on the TV Talk Shows, his own informercial with celebrity endorsements, I expected more, MUCH MORE!Basically, this book is just a primer for Robbins Personal Power Program, Seminars and related products. He wets your appetite and wants you to go for more. And where do you get more? You buy Personal Power, Power Talk, go to his Date With Destiny Seminars and buy more books, and tapes, go to more seminars.I checked Robbins out on the internet... now he is pushing a Financial Semimar called, you quessed it &quot;PERSONAL FINANCIAL POWER&quot; the cost to attend just $3,500. How do you suppose Robbins makes his money or acquires &quot;PERSONAL FINANCIAL POWER&quot; I suspect, it's not by the content of his seminar, bt by the profits ! of the seminar!I also made the mistake of calling the toll free number and now have been inundated with junk mail and annoying telemarketing calls from Robbins company and others (watch out, he sells names to other promoters).My best advice is not to buy this book. Not even worth $2 at a second hand bookstore."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Maybe it's because I've been a fan of the positive mind books for years and am already familiar with self-development techniques---but I really didn't see anything earth shattering in this or in Unlimited Power.To me, it's a matter of &quot;been there, done that&quot; show me something new with a lasting benefit. And for me the key word is &quot;substance&quot;, not promotion.In modern times, one of the very best in teaching personal development is Stephen Covey. His works are outstanding! No fluff or ads for $3,000 seminars here.I remember a few years ago when President Clinton hired Anthony Robbins temporarily, a member of the cabinet referred to Robbins as a &quot;charlatan&quot; and that what he represented &quot;is not success&quot;. Robbins work was short lived so maybe he had a point!If you are new to personal development, you may want to read this book. It is a easy read---however, I would rather see you start with &quot;SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY SUCE! !

First, as a Christian, they often offer wisdom and advice that is contrary to what I believe to be the truth. Second, so many of them are saying the same old thing. I'm also usually a little bit wary of those who become celebrities, such as Tony Robbins. But in spite of these caveats, I found that Tony Robbins' \\"Awakening the Giant Within\\" offers sound practical advice that will very likely change your life for the better. It also happens to be that what Robbins teaches, while not from a religious perspective, is consistent with Christian teaching and that of other religions as well.In short, this is a powerful book that teaches transformative principles: and you should read it and even study it. When I first read it more than 15 years ago, it set into motion a number of important, positive changes in my life that are still bearing fruit in my life. Every time I look back at the book, or part of it, I still learn something new. While Robbins is not necessarily original, he is an amazing synthesizer and presenter.

I believe that your life will improve if you follow the book's advice. Unfortunately, for many people, this entails referring to the book daily and fighting habits and thought patterns that may not be so easily overcome as Awaken the Giant Within suggests.Tony introduces (or probably revisits, for apostolates of his books) neuroassociative conditioning. The appeal of the techniques or methods that he prescribes is that they can change behavior overnight - even in minutes - if done properly. The flip side is that we do not have the scientific knowledge and research to prove that Robbins' methods work. Another problem is that making the methods work for some people (if indeed they can work) may require hiring a consultant in addition to reading the book.However, I still enjoyed reading the book and find it useful to refer back to it. Tony Robbins is an amazing and accomplished person. The most touching aspect of the book is the fact that you know he really wants the best for you, and wants to help you achieve what you want in life, even though he will never meet you. Obviously he is a positive person, and he refuses to let you believe that something cannot be done. He gives real life (and plausible) examples regarding how people have been able to eliminate unhealthy habits, overcome enormous difficulties, and find happiness, using various techniques that he describes or has invented or modified himself.I don't know if Tony is a prodigy or just a spruced up modern version of Dale Carnegie, but if you're in a rut or interested in self-improvement, reading the book can't hurt, and it might help. econ"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Anybody who claims Tony Robbins's teachings contradict Christianity, or are only a temporary &quot;high&quot; are wrong. Tony's concepts changed my life, because I had the desire to do so. He showed my how to apply my desire to change and channel that energy. People who claim it didn't work for them, did not utilize the techniques fully, because they truely didn't want to change. Like physical excerise, mental exercise requires time, patients and a lot of work. Going to the gym once will not make you buff and trim, and reading a Tony Robbins' book once will not do the same for your mind. You have to apply the information over and over to get results. As for the contradiction to Christianity, well, I don't understand that claim. Tony's philososphies are rooted in the power of a supreme being wanting us to be happy and helping us. I am a strong Christian, and the instructions I recieved from Tony only helped me to serve my fellow man better."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This is a very good book with lots of techniques and skills that will change your life, IF you faithfully apply them in your life to make a change. Robbins stands out from most self-improvement educators because he produces massive results by massive action and applying the techniques he learned.A lot of people I see who don't get any result out of this book are the people who reads it halfway, and didn't do anything else, let alone apply any of the techniques in this book! Another group envies the author's fame and wealth, and uses that as an excuse that the techniques can't change their life.Yet a group of very successful self-made millionaires I know recommend this book and say that this book is one of their favourite that changed their atiitudes, beliefs, and actions.If you want to be successful and improve, will following the suggestions and actions of those people who aren't successful make you sucessful? That would be like studying all the broken cars in the junkyard, in order to learn how to build a brand new car that works!This book includes many skills and 'tools of the mind' that you can use to change your life - such as Empowering Beliefs Sucessful people have, Power of Right Question, Knowing your values, Rules, among others.

And they probably buy Tony's books and tapes expecting him to wave a &quot;magic wand&quot; over their mediocre lives and make everything perfectly alright, with no further effort required...Such people are to be disappointed by Tony. What Tony teaches is actually Very Hard Work to put into practise.Tony is a remarkable man. He learned much, at a very young age. He applied what he learned. And he chose to share it with the rest of us. And, in the process, he made his fortune, which only a churl would begrudge him.Don't be fooled -- Tony's way is not easy: it is hard and it requires personal commitment. But is it good? Is it right? Does it work???Yes, yes, and alas yes.Tony Robbins is an Aristotle of our age. Like it or not. (His overt American style really p*sses me off, but his messages are spot on! He is bigger than Life. After a while, you get used to this.)Read his works, do as he suggests, and succeed. Or muddle along in your own mediocrity."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Admittedly, I've not finished this book yet; I'm about halfway through, actually. But I wanted to write this review now (of the first half at least) because I wanted to capture the profound enthusiasm I have for Anthony Robbins' methodologies about living a fulfilling life.I've read plenty of self-help books. There were times when I felt I didn't need them and times when I could hardly believe how depressed I felt. My friends and family were supportive, and that was very helpful. I saw a psychiatrist for a little bit and it was nice to talk about what was on my mind. But as I grew older (currently 21) I started to worry that my brain had been &quot;hard-wired&quot; to be unduly sad, or to behave in certain dysfunctional ways.One day flipping through the TV channels, I saw an interview with some guy named Anthony Robbins, talking about how he'd cured people with multipile personality disorder in under an hour when psychiatrists had tried for 17 years, how he would lead motivational seminars of 20,000+ people and consider his performance brilliantly successful, and how lucky he felt to be able to understand how to consciously operate a happy life.Intrigued by the prospects, I decided to pick up a copy of _Awaken the Giant Within_. The strong majority of self-help books are almost more like self-pitying books--books that feel bad for you and that make you feel bad for yourself. But _AtGW_ was motivational, excited, and eager to convey knowledge that was useful. It didn't give me a shoulder to cry on, it told me how I can stop crying.Each chapter seems to dig deep into my well-established habits of living--the good ones and the bad--and talk about where I might have gotten them from. For example, to this day I get very nervous about sex. Using Robbins' &quot;pain and pleasure&quot; theory (though I'm almost positive he didn't come up with it), I started to understand how I associated sex as both a pleasurable thing, and a source of extreme pain. So much more conscious of my feelings before, I was then in a position to transcend them.That's how this book has been working out for me. It shows me why I have the habits I have and how I can change them. It doesn't pander me like other books, it says straight-up, &quot;Here's how you can fix them.&quot; And best of all, it works! And really really well!I apologize for writing such a lengthy review, but I truly believe I'm making the world a better place by adding yet one more 5-star recommendation for this book."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Anthony Robbins is a master of promotion---that is his forte.

The problem, is that NAC (actually NLP, ROBBINS, changed the name) offers a limited time change. You feel good, but the changes don't last and this to me is misleading, as Robbins makes it sound like the changes will be permanent. You can't just &quot;anchor yourself&quot; or &quot;swish&quot; into a new per- sonality. A large portion of the book is just advertising for his &quot;Date with Destiny&quot; and other seminars. It's easier reading than the other NLP books out there by ... BANDLER &amp; GRINDER, ANDREAS, ETC. and can be somewhat useful which is why I gave it a 5. For anyone who wants even more rapid change that will last, I recommend BRIAN TRACY's BOOK ---MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT and any of TRACY'S audio tape programs. I also highly suggest &quot;THE SILVA METHOD&quot; by Jose Silva or any good boo on alpha programming.

This book is the \\"How To\\" manual for understanding emotionsand then using them to effect positive change in our lives and the lives of those around us.I think one of the reasons why it's so effective is because it's fundamental. If a professionalathlete is struggling, the first thing a coach does is exercise fundamentals. It shouldn'tbe any different for life. Don't get me wrong, it is going to take work. You just can't read this bookand then expect immediate fulfillment overnight. If an overweight person gets a gymmembership and a workout manual, they still have to put in the work to achieve the results they want.The gym and the manual are just resources, just like this book. Without proper use, the gains will beminimal if that. So if your life is \\"overweight\\" or unhealthy and you want a change for the better andyou're willing to work, then this book is definitely for you. I've had it for about two months and togetherwith the Ultimate Edge Program, I am seeing positive results and it's only getting better.THANKS TONY ROBBINS!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Often referred to by me as \\"The Book\\", I can't believe I've never written a review of it before. This book has changed and improved my life in a way that no other ever has. I casually refer to Anthony Robbins as \\"Uncle Tony\\" because his words feel like sage advice from a favorite uncle. It is constantly within easy reach, either on my desk where I spend most of my time, or on my nightstand by the bed. It it well-worn, highlighted and color-coded so that I can find key concepts at a glance any time I pick it up. I have purchased and given away many copies, to all of my closest friends. In my eyes, it is THE most valuable gift I can give to anyone, because as corny as it sounds, I feel as though I am giving the keys to LIFE. Yes, it is THAT important to me.The crux of this book is finding and realizing the power within yourself to make any change and improvement. We all have amazing strength, power and determination within us. Once we learn how to utilize that, there is nothing that can stop us from achieving our dreams. Many have criticized Robbins for \\"merely stating the obvious\\", but you'd be surprised how many people miss what is right there in front of us all the time. What he does is guide you into taking your blinders off and helping you to step out of yourself to really SEE the forces that guide every action we take. What it all comes down to is this: in the simplest, most basic terms everything we do, EVERY SINGLE THING, is an action to either avoid pain or gain pleasure. And we will often go to far greater lengths to avoid (usually imagined or over-estimated) pain than to gain pleasure. Also many times we take the easy route to short-term pleasure that leads to long-term pain, rather then suffer through some short-term pain to gain long-term pleasure. Once you are able to determine the motivations behind your goals and actions, you will be able to use them to your benefit to overcome any obstacle and make all of your dreams come true. Anything is possible once you put these forces to work for you instead of against you. :)My only criticism with this book is that Robbins relies heavily on personal anecdotes (frequently in conjunction with abundant name-dropping) that can easily come off as self-congratulatory. This is where my highlighting has been most beneficial because it allows me to skip over all of that to find the core message.While I honestly have yet to read it cover to cover, just reading and re-reading the first 10 chapters have been enough to make huge improvements in my life. Currently I am working on reading the entire book finally. :)I would HIGHLY recommend this book to ANYONE who is unhappy with ANY aspect of his/her life and wishes to make some changes, no matter how large or small. The person who turned me on to Uncle Tony said he used the principles in this book to get out of a bad relationship, quit smoking, stop using drugs, and put himself back on the right path. I have personally used this book to break out \\"learned helplessness\\" and feeling like I had no control over my life. Now I know that nothing controls my life more than I do. I am always referring back when I feel like I am in a rut. It never fails to give me a fresh perspective. :)"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I am a therapist who thrives on personal growth and helping other people achieve it. I have been to tons of seminars, read literally thousands of books, and this one distills them all down very succinctly into news you can use. I think some of the terminology is more complicated than it needs to be, but the ideas are very sound. Even if you can't grasp all of what is being said, there is so much material here that it would be near impossible to fail at making changes at some area of your life. I highly recommend it. This doesn't mean that my journey (or yours) should stop here. I intend to keep searching, but I am sure that this is a book that I will go back to again and again.

Well anyway to make a long story short I was diagnosed with a life threatening disease shortly before Christmas of 2010. I had treatment and now I am in remission. The fight to survive took everything out of me and then some. I had to start the process of rebuilding physically and mentally. I had known about techniques used in the practice of neurolinguistic programming or NLP for a while. This book had been out for quite awhile but it is still very timely. The techniques described in this book are great and rooted in sound practices. There is a large amount of information to read through. Read the book and trying a few or All of the techniques. I would also recommend other books by Anthony Robbins, \\"Unlimited Power\\" and \\"Notes From a Friend\\"."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"The CD itself is great, my seller was so nice and accommodating. However, I didn't shop around before buying this. I paid $60.00 for this, and afterwards, I noticed you can buy it anywhere else for $12.00-$20.00. I was completely foolish to not look elsewhere. :( Lesson Learned! So before you buy this at such a high price, check EBay, Overstock and other selling sites!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This CD has it's moments. If you are looking for for a jump start on life change it is not bad. Some of the info on goal setting is helpful. I can't say that I would recommend this to friends, although I certainly wouldn't condemn it to them either. This CD outlines a few goal setting strategies flavored by some classic tenets of motivational speakerism and cognitive behavioral therapy. I liked the emphasis on doing and on accountability towards life change. I bought this CD used for about $3.00, I did get my money's worth."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I think Tony Robbins is brilliant. He's simple and very logical in everything I've ever read or heard by him. When I hear of what some of his critics say, I have to wonder if they've ever even read his books. There's nothing spooky here, folks. Most everything he teaches is a &quot;no brainer&quot;--things you can't believe you wouldn't think of on your own. More than anything else, Tony reveals the obvious, things we were probably too busy or wrapped up in our daily lives to see on our own, hence the term &quot;life coach.&quot;&quot;Awaken&quot; was a fabulous follow-up to &quot;Unlimited Power.&quot; I was pleasantly surprised to see that Tony didn't simply piggy back on the success of his 1st best seller by simply pumping out another book of lesser usefulnees and quality. On the contrary, Tony did a fantastic job with this one. It's packed with useful information and suggestions. In my opinion, it's a better book than &quot;Awaken&quot; but not by much, as &quot;Awaken&quot; is a priceless book in its own right.10 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book completely changed my life.

But ifyou wan't to change it and make it something you never thoughtpossible then read it!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Funny thing about all of these motivational speakers... they're all rich. And that's one of things that makes us buy their stuff. Though they preach motivation and personal growth, the unsaid implication is that if we follow their lessons, we'll be rich, too.Tony is no exception; he talks on this tape about how one year he was living in a tiny bachelor apartment, and a few years later he was living in a castle and flying his jet helicopter to his seminars.But what none of these people ever talk about--including Tony--is HOW they got so wealthy. That would be a problem, since they tend to downplay the importance of money, all the while being paid millions of dollars to do so.My hunch is that Tony makes his money by having people come to his seminars and buy his stuff. It's the same with financial guru Suze Orman--she hasn't made her money through smart investing; she's made it by writing books and doing a TV show telling us how to invest.One of the secrets of making money is to find a niche and fill it; if you can't find one, then you invent one and convince people they need it. Arnold Schwarzenegger did this back in the 80's; he convinced people they were out of shape and came up with the whole \\"I'm going to pump you up\\" campaign. Tony, Peter Lowe, Zig Ziglar and others have done this with our minds: convinced us that we need to get control of our lives, and to let them tell us how to do it.That's not to say Tony's stuff is a scam; if you're feeling out of sorts with the world, this tape is indeed a valuable help in focusing on how to get back with it. But for people who have a normal level of intelligence and presence of mind, it may be somewhat unsatisfying.One thing I've learned is that sometimes the best advice someone can give you is to stop asking for advice! I think a fair number of Personal Power converts probably spend too much time and money going to seminars and studying Tony's stuff, and not enough time simply living their lives and making their own decisions. This tape is not going to tell you how to earn enough money to buy a helicopter or live in a castle. It is not going to tell you how to end up with a beautiful spouse and kids. It will tell you to follow your dream, and offers a few basic guidelines on how to do that. But you have to do the work.N.B. The tape ends by telling us that by following Tony's advice, you'll attract the \\"appropriate coaches and role models.\\" Sounds like a plug for Tony's personal coaching services. In other words, even after you've awakened your inner giant, you'll still need help! (Hint: you still need to buy more stuff!)"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Fluff? ATGW is fluff?? I'm imagining you only read the book. Am I right? I didn't just read the book. I used it. I traded in my most disempowering questions to myself for the most empowering.... and I did the same with my rules, values, beliefs and decisions. I have two lives. The one before I started using what I'd learned in Awaken the Giant Within, and the life I have had after I started using what I learned in that book. It is like night and day. I no longer suffer depression, anger or anxiety - I use them and teach others how to use them. It doubled my income in six months. It put the healthy function in my formerly dysfunctional family. I went from suicidal to saving people teetering on the edge of suicide.If you're buying the book just to read it, don't waste your money. But if you really want to improve the quality of your life and your character by and you're willing to use the book to that end instead of just read it, it's the best money you'll ever spend in your life.Check out my site.

And yes, Robbins, does talk a lot about his seminars that may or may not be overpriced. But there's still a lot of useful stuff here. It's kind of refreshing that while other self-help gurus seem to be veering off into weird and obscure spiritualism (Okay! My opinion only!) Robbins sticks to the same stuff that has always worked: goal setting, discipline, learning, and relationships. I repeat: this is not magic. You will not turn the last page and find a million dollars in you r bank account. But picking out and applying the basic principals will definitely make you more prepared for success."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to get more control of my life and I've heard of Tony (who hasn't!). I did get some benefit out of the book but it fell short of my expectations.

Still, what works for one person may or may not work for you. Read both and decide."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Tony Robbins is a gifted salesman. He has boundless energy, optimism, and knows how to set goals. If his books and tapes were as effective as his sales prowess, we would all have been immensly successful and deliriously happy long ago.Robbins pivots his approach around Thorndyke's Law of Effect that, briefly, states that behavior that gives rise to a pleasurable state of affairs tends to be repeated, and behavior that gives rise to a painful state tends not to be repeated. Then Robbins shifts into Watson's and Skinner's behavioralism and pushes operant conditioning, saying that every problem is a behavioral problem. He then shifts gears once again and talks about the &quot;power of focus,&quot; which is his spin of Gestalt psychology. When this brew is delivered optimistically, it has some effect, especially if you listen to Robbins on tape.There are some more serious issues. For example, I believe that his nutritional advice is harmful to all but those with a very unusual metabolism. His motivational material can also build up unrealistic expectations and set you up for frustration when you don't even come close to meeting them. So much in life does not depend on you and me, so much is other people's doing and blind fate, so many insights and ideas come to us to late. This book has insights, but it is not great."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have read all of Tony Robbins books, used to listen to his audio tapes in the car, went to Chicago for &quot;Unleas the Power Within&quot; and to Hawaii for Life Mastery but when I found out that he was divorcing his wife Beckie because he had found another girl (I was told she was one of the many volunteers who attend Robbins' conferences to make them run smoothly), I lost all respect for the man. He used to regale us with Beckie stories and made it sound as if this were the marriage of the century. How can we believe anything he as to say now? He is just another adulterer with the requisate trophy wife. God, the hypocrisy. Making millions of dollars preaching one thing, and doing anothr. There's a lot of money in bilking people these days, as Mr. Robbins has found out. The book is well-written and does have time-tested theories, but how can one take it seriously?"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have been reading self help books with a focus on success the last 12 years. I have read all Tony's book as well as Brian Tracy etc. And looking back I can only say; how stupid to spend time and money reading this junk!Now I am in my mid 30'ies and I am successful my normal standards, good job, nice home, lovely wife etc. But it was not because of this book.The one thing these people have in common is that they have become successful by telling others how to be successful. And that they try to be an expert in all areas that are of importance, at least that they believe are important. If you want to learn about a specific subject, look after books written by expert in the area, selling, time management, relationships etc. Tony can hardly be an expert in all these areas, the only thing he know is marketing of junk.It is easy to read the book, one feel happy afterwards because you think you will be soooo successful a few weeks from now, but the problem is that this book will do nothing at all to help you, no other Tony Robbins books or CD either, (and I have them all!) This book might help you feel good for some time but you will not be successful with the techniques that he writes about.I think that the feeling good thing is what makes people write five start reveiws, but no reviewer tells you in the reveiw what thay have accomplished after implementing the strategies learned from the book, and the reason is simple, they have not accomplished anything!After reading all I can and takling to successfull people I can only recommend a few books that actually can help you:Overachievement by John Eliot is the only book you need to learn how to think in a way that will help you become successfull.Other good books are:the highest goalLife is not a game of perfectJust enough"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I'll try to keep it short. This is not book for everyone, no matter that it was written for everybody. What I mean to say is that this book could be useful for everyone, but it will be useful only for those who find a will and dedication to make some changes in their lives. It is written in very simple and straight forward language. There is no unnecessary philosophy, but practical explanations what to do in order to succeed in personal change.Anthony Robbins in my opinion is genius of personal development. His ingenuity is in the fact that he has put together number of very simple concepts (most of those can be found elsewhere, in NLP, with other authors), but he put them in a way that is simple to apply and easy to understand. However, that does not mean that they are easy to apply, that requires persistence and dedication. That brings us to my first thought, that this book is only for those who are committed to change. My personal favorite form this book is the part on the vocabulary of ultimate success. Becoming aware of internal dialogue is simple and very efficient way to manage our emotions and to stay persistent on our path to change.I've read this book years ago in paperback version, so I can say from personal experience that it helped me a lot over this years and I am using bunch of things from it on regular basis. If I could compare to any other book that made so much impact on me (from this kind of literature), I could only compare it with 7 Habits. These two are most probably that I recommended to biggest number of people around me.I hope it will help you at least as much as it helped me!All the best,Igor"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Ahoy there mate. Just finished cleaning my knife. Went through New York City and had a laddy come up to me with a pocket knife. I saz to him, you call that a knife. I pulled out my knife (which looked like a miniture sword to him) and saz, &quot;Now this is a knife.&quot; The laddy ran little a scared little chicken.I came across several of Tony Robbins Powertalk tapes, I did. Very good programs the lot. Really enjoyed them. Sent some copies back to my friends in Australia. They really enjoyed them too.In particular was the one about decisions. I really enjoyed that one. Really impressed me. Made me decide to buy more of Tony Robbins books and tapes and improve myself more and more.So I bought another PowerTalk program on references. Oh yes I did. And as I read this New Yorker's review on Tony Robbins I realized that he didn't have any referneces to substaniate his preponderance bs.Sort of reminded me of a guy from New York who went into surgery becuase he had gangrene in his left leg and had to have it removed (the whole leg)When this lad went into surgery the surgeons accidently removed the wrong leg so t hey brought him back in and took the other leg off.When this poor lad realized what had happened, he contacted a lawyer straight away and heard back in a forthnight. But alas, he was told that he couldn't sue the hospital or the surgeons for what appeared to be outright incompetence.Why you ask? Because he didn't have a leg to stand on (he-he-he-he)Seriously, this New Yorker who obviously is not aware that Elvis has been dead since 1977 is one sorry guy. Picture a guy who has to buy all of his Tony Robbins programs used. No wonder he has missed out on the message. The programs are probably so worn down that they sound worst than an old Elvis 45 rpm record made back in early 60's.Anyway mates, I really enjoy the Tony Robbins book Awaken The Giant and the PowerTalk Tapes. Sure beats sitting around and playing some pc game like Grand Auto Theft or something like that. This lad from New York probably watches Professional Wrestling matches and thinks it is real and unrehearsed too.I feel sorry for this poor, poor lad. Yes indeed, there except for the grace of God go I but since this poor, poor guy is one of God's children we have to respect him.I guess, considering this New Yorkers attitude and probable lack of success, he is living proof that God, our creator does indeed have a sense of humor. After all, he created this guy.There except for the grace of God go I. Thank you God for blessing me. Perhaps you can throw at least one gift to this guy.

What even more great about this book is that IT WORKS and the method is very simple in understand all human behaviour with a simple but VERY effective method of pain and pleasure. I am now free from all the bad habbits that i was a slave to. THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Here is a book that is predicated on a somewhat Aristotelian concept of the Potential Self. Robbins posits that there is a Potential Self for each of us that is far greater than our presently experienced Actual Self.What he doesn't say, nor does he appear inclined to say, is that this could be true, however the Potential-Actual Self gap varies dramatically from person to person.This poses difficulties for those who are feeling around for the outlines of their true Potential Selves from the relative smallness of their Actual Selves.Robbins' suggestions in this book will probably be most effective for those who have a firm, realistic grasp on who they actually are, what their limitations consist of, and what the opportunity costs of transcending said limitations will likely be.Try as most of us might, and believe with all our hearts, it is most doubtful that we will morph into a Richard Branson, a Mohammed Ali, a Barry Diller, a Sean John Combs, a Bill Clinton,a Bono, or a Brittney Spears.... nor, once we fully understood the costs that these luminaries had to pay for their greatness, would we necessarily want to.The question hinges then on how well we do know ourselves, and perhaps more challenging to our self fantasies, how willing we would be to see ourselves as others see us, to have a significantly objective evaluation of our strengths and weaknesses put before us in an undeniable way?? Such is the hard path that a minority is inclined to follow.For whatever it is worth, the genetic lottery is still the number one game in town. Some of us will have more grace, some will be beautiful, some mediocre, some seriously flawed. Life will be easier for one person than it is for another.Those who have first come to terms with those limits may be in the best position to transcend them as they may make the best evaluation of how much effort, how much time, how great a portion of their mental life will be consumed in the quest.What percentage of the readers of Awaken The Giant have contacted a first rate testing service and had psychological and aptitude profiles run on them, spoken with a qualified psychologist or counsellor about their strengths and weaknesses,compared their temperaments to their goals to see if they are suitably matched ? 1% maybe ? .1% more likely....All that said, if you have done the prerequisite groundwork, you have a realistic assessment of who you are and how great the Potential-Actual Self gap is in your specific case, you could possibly derive great value from this book by Mr.Anthony Robbins.Tony might come back and say that this personal realism is nothing more than a self limiting belief that you must get out of your head at once if you are to awaken the giant within. I would say in reply that Tony couldn't be more wrong. One of the most liberating pieces of self knowledge one can have is to know one's natural limits and do one's best being what one can be, instead of burning endless hours, hopes, and dollars trying to be what one cannot possibly be. As samuel Johnson said, no man is so ridiculous as when he attempts to be what he cannot possibly be.Of course, there is always the other side of the argument. One could also be saddled with falsely limiting beliefs as to who one is, how far one might go, what the world has to offer, how one can maximize ones gifts and minimize one's weaknesses.To add to the frustration, but hey, this is life we're talking about, many of us overestimate ouselves in some areas and underestimate ourselves in others. Massive egotists are stuck with a heavy dose of overestimation, depressives with a massive dose of underestimation. For the majority of us, we're like wheels that are out of balance, a little too much here, not quite enough there.I would definitely consider Tony's thoughts, techniques, and so on, useful steps in direct proportion to one's self knowledge. With the lack of self knowledge, they may lead to a state of dissatisfaction. Why isn't this working for me ???If it is working for you, congratualtions, you've done your homework and you can put the tools to good use. If it isn't working for you, move back a step, get to know yourself and where your head is at for real, then try again."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I'm studying Hypnosis and hypnotherapy etc... and my teacher advised me to buy one of anthony robbins book,so I did, and I found they really Interesting and indispensable, great book !"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Great service will use again on time securily wrapped, very easy, book was in great condition will use again hands down very professional."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"It's clear why Tony has become so successful.

I read this book many years ago along w/ 1 or 2 others and listened to a cassette (remember those?) or 2. No question he speaks and writes w/ passion. Somewhere along the way, I just got turned off by this guy. I was listening to him talking w/ John Wooden. Somehow he was able to coerce the legendary coach to chat with him. Mr Robbins was nauseatingly over-the-top sycophantic towards the coach. It didn't jibe w/ his philosophy of self-empowerment. It was an emperor has no clothing moment for me. Also, he's way too earnest in marketing himself. I guess he's a walking embodiment of self-empowerment. He's mainly empowered his bank account and lifestyle by convincing a lot of people to buy his books and attend his seminars.I can't not (double negative, all apologies to my 9th grade English teacher) recommend this book, because it is powerful. On the other hand, if you want to empower yourself, just take out a pen and paper (or your computer) and write out how to do it. It's not difficult to come up w/ these ideas w/ a little effort. If you're a thoughtful person, you really don't need Mr. Robbins to Awaken Your Giant Within."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"All the unfounded, undocumented criticism against Tony Robbins can be dismissed with a single quote by playright Cristoph Lichtenberg: &quot;a book is like a mirror-- if an ass looks into it, don't expect an apostle to look out of it&quot;."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"If you have very high expectations of this book, you may be bitterly disappointed. The authors slams together various self-development themes--most of which he already presented in his previous published work--and claims that if you follow his advice your life will be significantly changed for the better. Don't hold your breath, either figuratively or literally: it's hard to imagine most people regularly doing Robbins' breathing excercises or adhering to a vegetarian diet. Besides, these things seem to have little connection to feeling good and having lots of money, which seems to be the author's definition of success.Besides some concrete, and apparently shaky advices, the book consists of broad phrases of encouragement and soothing statements about compatability of seemingly incompatible things, such as satisfaction and relentless drive. As in his previous work, Robbins seems to overstate the power of associative thinking, if true, this seems to me the most damaging criticism. He also regularly conflates Pavlovian conditioned reflex with simple mental associations which peple develop regularly and which have nothing to do with reflexes.The book is an easy read. If you never had exposure to self-development literature, you may consider buying it. At times, however, the style is tedious, as Robbins unnecessarily underlines words or has them printed in bold type, or both."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Tony Robbins is one of the biggest names in the game.

This book combines everything one could possibly ask for.I would label this book as the best advice you can receive for under $20. Some of the strategies and principals he teaches in this book are taught in weekend seminars which cost thousands upon thousands.Get this book, read it, and apply some of it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This is a pretty good book but a bit dry in places.

Make a lot of money by selling people hope. 2. Got a black belt in karate by having personal instruction from a grand master. 3. Learn to fly a jet helicopter (couldn't you if you had the financial resources?) 4. Walked on Fire. Has he witten any major works of fiction or poetry, has he learned even one foriegn language? With NAC or NLP he should be able to teach himself 1/2 a dozen quickly. Has he created anything other than slick self improvement babble which encourages people to cover up their pain with mindless enthusiasm for acquiessence? I used his program and all it was good for was getting temporarily pumped up with false confidence. Robbins doesn't address the mystery and paradoxes of life. His clientele are people pusuing the emptiness of the American Dream, desperately trying to fill the void that it creates. Quick Fix Tony's solutions will rarely last longer than the afterglow of one of his seminars. Robbins will never run out of customers, naive young people are being sold the American Dream every day on TV and Robbins will gladly guide them towards it (for a small fee, of course).

When I read those reviews, I saw that more and more people no longer simply accept things like that; they are rational and more critical.Tony Robbins! If I was in front of you right now here is what I would say: &quot;Thank you, Tony, for being such a 'friend'. You took thousands of dollars from me over the years because I was miserable and didn't know how to live. You 'cared' about me so much you wanted to 'help' me -for a small fee of course- some 'friend' you are! You helped me to awaken the 'Giant' within myself and to take some 'giant' steps. You also made me realize the 'unlimited' power I had within. But, you know what? None of it ever helped me. My family told me to stop waisting my money on your tapes, books, and seminars, but I just couldn't. I was so depressed and hurt from my past that you became like a drug to me. I listenned to your tapes daily... I wrote in my journal a couple of times a day... I used your OPA program... I did all your conditioning techniques... I had incredible goals and dreams, and today, 9 years later, I see that my life didn't change a bit. Thank you Tony for that. But you know, I have been saved. I no longer think about you. I threw out all of your books and tapes a year ago, and I am free again. No stupid conditioning, or asking myself moronic positive questions every morning and evening, controlling my physiology, writing in my journal, artificially copying people to become 'friends', listinning to your same jokes and same tapes over and over again.... It's all finished. I'm still sad at times but I can now deal with my problems because I discovered that no one can help me but myself. And this knowledge gave me strengh. I'm a new person today.

If you are ready to do so, I recommend you to buy this book... It's an excellent one !This book is an enormous (550 pages !) bible. Absolutely all personal development techniques are in. Basically, if you need some positive thinking, after you read this book (and if you believe everything), you'll think that you can change your whole life in an instant, that you are the marvel among the marvels, that you can always win and feel good. What a program !Indeed,there are some really valuable tools to get from this book, that help understanding human behavior in details. There are very intelligent and &quot;easy to understand&quot; chapters. As for myself, I was able to make positive changes in my life. But it took some time, I had to work hard actually. NAC is really good, although it is pure NLP (i.e a try to make readers believe he invented NLP...). Reading it without working it will lead to : &quot;Oh yes, that's right ! (...) Oh sure, I knew that ! (...) Oh ! Success looks very easy !...&quot;. But you won't change at all.Also, I know many people who read the book, or went to the over crowded and over expensive seminars, and after several years, they are still &quot;the same&quot; ! Obviously, Mr Robbins is a great speaker, and an excellent salesman.Sometimes, although his techniques are valuable, I think of all these poor people who bought the dream to change their life in an instant, who paid thousands of dollars for the seminars, the tapes, and all the stuff that is &quot;hard-sold&quot; too... and who are still facing the same problems, while Mr Robbins enjoys the million dollars he earns. He sells them the American dream and tells them &quot;success is easy ! Look at me... I enjoy the American dream !&quot;. And they believe.It is not jealousy. But I think one cannot &quot;guarantee&quot; success when statistics are far from 100%. He does know it, and he continues. However, as I sa! id, if you are able to discipline your life, and to work on the material, I recommend this book. It's a cheap and good investment, according to the seminar (you'll hear exactly the same thing for 30 times more expensive).&quot;Only&quot; a very good book, but a very good book !"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"A couple years ago, I was fortunate to be among some sales reps who were sent to a one-day Tony Robbins seminar! ONE DAY with this man is to be buoyed up for DAYS! I can only imagine what an entire workshop with him would be like! You leave pumped up and full of ideas and enthusiasm. I'm not fond of Robbins' books ONLY because you REALLY have to experience him first hand. I don't know that I would have spent the money on a seminar, books or tapes had I not had the first one paid for by my company. I must say though, NOW I would save up to attend one of his weekends or seminars! The books are simply &quot;texts,&quot; you get out what you put in! Robbins' is a magician!

It's better than pure positive thinking. I think a lot of the &quot;fat&quot; could have been taken out and the repeated information from Unlimited Power could have been left out. My only major gripe is Robbins constant self promotion and advertising his &quot;Date with Destiny&quot; and other seminars. He also makes it sound like he invented NAC (actually NLP-Neurolinguilstic Programmng) and that his NAC is somehow better and different than NLP. Overall, I think it's a good book, especially for people unfamiliar with NLP and unlike other NLP books is easy to read. I also highy recommend &quot;7 Strategies for Wealth &amp; Happiness&quot; and &quot;The Art of Exceptional Living&quot; by Jim Rohn. &quot;NLP-The New Science of Personal Achievement&quot; by NLP Comphrehensive is one of the best pure NLP books &amp; NO FAT OR HYPE!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book just put it all together for me.

There are the 10 Action signals, which remind you to do something different right away. There are several exercises on goal-setting and understanding your own rules. He concludes the book with a lengthy discussion on healthy eating and exercising--after all, if you don't take proper care of yourself, little else matters!

Invest the time to read this now!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book, as excellent as it is, is titled wrong and I will explain. The title here is \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\".This so called Giant within is the ultimate you, the best you, your highest self or your spirit self/perfect self. This self is not and has never been sleeping and does not need to be awakened... We need not awaken the Giant within. It is we who need to awaken to the Giant within! It is we who are sleeping. All of us at times, some more than others, sleep walk through areas of our lives and never recognize the power already within us just waiting for us to unleash it. We tend to ignore that soft still voice that speaks to us from within guiding us to realize our pure potentiality. How do we unleash it?... We trust our intuition and we trust that little voice. We let go of fear, worry and doubt and follow through with all that we dream of for our lives. As we live our lives fully awake and in awareness we are awakend to the Giant within.Tony's book as I have renamed it, Awaken to the Giant Within, is not just full of motivation and inspiration, but full of strategies and techniques to discover and wake up to the giant within you, as well as give you strategies to make your dreams come true. When you understand on a conscious level who you really are then you can do anything you desire. When you understand who you are, you realize you are the Giant, unstoppable with the potential to be, do or have anything you want. Not until you know who you are can you truly know what you want. When you know who you truly are you drop the Ego and all of its desire to impress others and instead you find your Spirit Self (the Giant) and you no longer desire to impress but only to express. Then you will truly be able to live a life of truth. Tony's book helps you know who you really are, discover what you really want and are capable of.You cannot just read this book. You MUST DO THE WORK to get results! In order for your life to change you must change. At times you may feel uncomfortable doing some of the exercises in this book but discomfort is a signal that you are expanding yourself. If you are not growing you are dying... Commit to doing the work and your rewards will far outweigh the effort you put into it. The work will become a constant part of your life not just a one time thing. As you evolve you will discover new areas of your life to improve upon and even if those areas are great, you can always go to the next level.Give yourself the gift and not only get this book but DO THE WORK!!!I also highly recommend all of Tony's products.

The book is pretty hefty, but is well worth the read. It is a \\"take action\\" kind of book and the author tries several different ways to get you away from the book and work on the things he teaches. The book starts off with getting you ready for what he calls, \\"unleash your power\\" inside. That is done through decision making and understanding how they affect us. And you are taught how to control that \\"power\\" and let it shape your life.It can take some time practicing his principles, but after all, why else get a book on self improvement unless we intend to improve ourselves. That is what I liked about the book. It's not just to gain some knowledge on a certain topic, but to actually improve your life in some way; and the principles are legitimate too. No quick fixes, but the real thing. The book also keeps your attention, which is needed for a book this size. He does it by clever cartoons here and there, questions he asks you to write down and actual exercises that can be applied just about wherever you are. It's not perfect by any means, but if you have the time and you seriously want to improve what you have or don't have, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"It is amazing life transforming book and must read for everyone who would like to have a long lasting change in life.Now I have become great of Tony Robbins.............."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"After years of being mesmerized, hypnotized, industrialized, robotic and socially ostracized, I found something that would get me back on my feet again.

A similar technigue is used in a new kind of therapy that is teaching people to recognize body postures that keep people stuck in negative states and can trigger a failure mode. A person with confidence doesn't walk around with his shoulders slumped and his arms dragging the ground. Carolina Tarheel players were swooshing all evening yesterday.

While listening to the CD, I kept waiting for the Wow moment, as in when is he going to say something, I think \\"WOW!\\". Never happened. The material is good, but simplistic and very basic. It is a good introduction for someone who is becoming aware of self sabotage by their own thoughts and needs a primer to shift their focus. This is like the movie that ends and you know there's definetely going to be a Part 2, because there are too many unanswered questions. In other words this work is the hook, which gives you a taste, and then reels you in (if you allow it), to buy other products authored by Anthony Robbins.

It is worth reading for this alone.One detraction from this book is that although the author references many different works and experts in the field, there is no bibliography. All references at the end of the book are to parts of the Robbins consortium of companies.

I picked it up after reading unlimited power which I liked. Robbins covers so many topics, it's impossible to list them all. It's basically designed to be an 'owners manual for the brain' but I find to be nothing more than 'pump up' hype. It just doesn't make sense to me no matter how often I read it. I could critique every chapter of the book, but I have to abide by the 1000 word limit. One chapter that I think is extremely misleading is the one about questions. He says better questions produce a better quality life . OK. Like if I get mugged Ill say &quot;How can I use this&quot; and everything will be allright. PUHLEEZE! The fitness advice is outright juvenille, and his financial advice doesn't even warrant a review. My bottom line is his stuff just doesn't cut it. I know, Ive done his programs for years and have no improvements whatsoever. Neither do any of the people i know who have also tried it. DO NOT BUY INTO THE HYPE! HE IS LIKE A CIGARETTE, ONCE YOU READ ONE OF HIS BOOKS (OR PROGRAMS) YOU&quot;LL FEEL COMPELLED TO BUY MORE, GO TO HIS SEMINARS, ETC. HE IS ADDICTIVE! It's a vicious circle. Anyone who wishes to challenge me on this topic, write a review and let me know."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Robbins book is lacking writing skills on every site. The tremendous amount of informacials and quastionable stories makes this book a very, very poor written one. This is - simply and polemical said - a very outdated and overrated nonsense from the early 90's which is proven to not help ppl in the long term. Awaken the giant within &lt;-- Rather consider you are a human being and no monster.Reading this book is - again simply and polemical said - a torture.I give this a two star ranking. Some of the mentioned means are quite useful and very well known and much better described in other books. The power of visualizing for example is proven and well practised in sports science. You definitely don't need to read 400 sites of a bloated book that could easily be shorten to 100 sites or less.If this book helped anybody, I mean REALLY helped you in the long term, then I feel honestly happy for you. But be honest: was it rather just a moment where you THOUGHT it helped and changed you?"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I like the idea of making decisions by blocking all other alternatives.

This and other Tony's stuff has helped me rise from very low to infinity. I cannot thank this Great Man enough."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I'll make this short, Anthony Robbins is everything that is wrong with the world. Not one idea of his is original and not stollen from someone else. He skims the surface of modern psychology (mostly Victor Frankl, everyone steals from Frankl) and passes it off as their own enlightened sense of well being and success. Yes he's living his dream. Why? Because his dream was to get rich by selling nothing. And that is what he's done, mooched of the idea's and theories of others that took them a lifetime to perfect, and he's packaged it and now he's selling it. It's dangerous and irresponsible, not to mention superficial.It's low brow but I quote Triumph the Insult Comic Dog: &quot;To make fun of him, would be in a sense, like pooping on poop.&quot;"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have just read what this person writes regarding Robbins' ways against christianity. With all due respect, I just want to say that if you're looking to improve your life, to be confindent of your actions, and firmly believe that you're in control of your own destiny, maybe christianity is not the path for you. Firstly, christianity is a mere invention towards gaining power over the masses. Secondly, christianity is not based on the real teachings of Jesus Christ, it's all about manipulation to DISEMPOWER people, to make them more docile. When Robbins uses the word \\"Whatever it takes......\\"...depends on your criteria. As an adult, I know exactly what I'm doing when I take an action. Believe me, if you want to gain power no matter what,despite hurting people , you'll know it !!!!.....And it's a personal decision anyway.I think Robbins is a millionaire because people like us buy his stuff. But I have to admit that he is a terrific inspirator, and that his knowledge about PNL, and other subconscious techniques are impressive. He's one of the best presentators I've heard. So I give him his well deserved credit for that.What really strucked me hard, was the beginning of the tape, the cheesy speech about the silly helicopter, and the traffic jam because of his FABULOUS seminar.........I don't know....I was about to shut the player off, but I kept going, and I really enjoyed it after that.My advise, again, if you try to gain power over life and destiny, forget about christianity, the church, catholics, and all their variations. The real value of the human being is not written in dogmas, but written in the souls of the people who believe in the collective welfare."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"before winding up my arm for a brief sermon on the effectivnessor sometimes effectiveness or sometime non effectiveness of NLP ideas, however they are packaged....An NLP joke that was making the rounds in the trainings. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who think there are two kinds of people in the world and those that don't. Get IT ?No ? Didn't get it ? Wait a minute... this isn't The Forum, this isn't EST, we don't get IT around here.But this much is true. Every decade or so there is a new face in town, the man with the answers, the guy everybody, male or female has a crush on, the figure we identify with as our big enlightened thousand watt smile hero.Once it was Billy Sunday, once it was Krishnamurti, once it was Werner Erhard, you can fill in the blanks in your free time.This isn't to say that Tony is doing bad stuff... its OK stuff, decent quality, functional stuff, but it isn't the Second Coming or anything... there are still lacunas, incomplete areas, tough ideas that have been watered down to be suitable for mass marketing purposes.Then there is this small but nagging issue of Meta-Belief. And another called Congruity.Well fine and dandy, last one first. Congruity. The master teacher on the subject of Congruity is a man, still alive but elderly, who lives and works in Friday Harbor, Washington State, across the sound from Anacortes, and to this day teaches seminars on Congruity. His name is David Dobson and he is spoken of by some as a living Milton Erikson.Anybody here ever taken the touble to locate Dobson and study with him ? Anybody here ever heard of Dobson ? Tony Robbins sure did. He was scheduled to attend the same trainings with Dobson that I was... Tony got distracted doing infomercials or something and broke off at the last minute, sent one of his people on ahead. Did Tony ever get around to serious face time with Dave ? No way to know.Tony sure talks a lot about Congruity, but he tosses it out there like another groovy idea, some mental secret sauce, instead of boring in on the deep levels of understanding Congruity, its significance, the distinctions of congruity and incongruity, and the near mystical levels of human interaction Dobson calls Other Than Conscious Communication. Dave is out there to this day. You want to get a tight bead on Congruity ? See Dave while he is with us. Then carefully compare Tony's understanding of Congruity with Dobson'sAh yes, Meta Beliefs... I think that I was the first person in NLP to start talking about Meta Beliefs, and then there was a kinda sorta tentative acceptance of this distinction... to etherial for certain types who like to ground their mojo in crisp pictures and plangent bell tones...Meta Beliefs are &quot;beliefs about beliefs&quot;. The previous reviewer, who evinces a strong faith based worldview, has a powerful Meta Belief that informs his thought processes. Is that good or not so good ? Lets examine.His Meta Belief is that strong, unshakable belief (although he doesn't say exactly how this belief is represented in his thinking.... movies ? sparkly pictures ? echo chamber type sounds ?) is the prime determinant of success or failure. To assert &quot;change your belief, and you will change your reality accordingly&quot; is, in itself, a potent meta belief that could, potentially, be liberating, self limiting, or not much or either, depending on the context and circumstances.Could his Meta Belief be refined to give him more real world effectiveness ? Undoubtedly so. Many early peoples, or pre industrial peoples had intense faith in their gods and totems, yet they were wiped out by smallpox and modern weapons regardless of their ghost dances and visits to the spirit world.The Cherokee, on the other hand, were darned smart, they kept elements of their faith, but they studied the European ways that made them successful and emulated accordingly. They were the only Native American to develop a unique alphabet , Sequoian, based on Hebrew, Greek, and something else, published newspapers in Sequoian, learned to fire hard brick, trained lawyers who argued before the US Supreme Court, and sadly, unnerved Andred Jackson sufficiently (he was afraid they'd form an alliance with the English) that Jackson wiped them out and stole all their possessions.The Trail Of Tears aside, one could say that the Cherokee had much more sophisticated Meta Beliefs than their plains bretheren.They could analyse and choose when faith in the old gods would be of benefit, and when careful analysis and consideration of costs vs. benefits of material actions could alther their fate.Tony falters, in my opinion, when he dives right in and insists that you change your belief system. He should take more time to closely examine Meta Belief and how it brings belief systems into existence. Once you gain leverage at the Meta Belief level, although you must be exceedingly careful with it, profound change becomes available.Other parts of the world today, obviously those riven with strife and deprivation appear to be suffering from either a complete loss of belief in anything (Nihilism), i.e. the Meta Belief that nothing can be worth believing in except immediate survival, or hyper intensified Meta Belief,(Absolutism) i.e. the more anything causes me to doubt my belief, the greater that proves the power of the Dark One... thus feeling of doubt, questioning, or curiosity about the Outer Realms are in and of themselves evidence of seduction into the ways of Error... quite a gummy thought loop to find oneself mired within, like those super sticky glue traps....However, the great advances toward modern thinking were precisely great Meta Belief shifts, as when Martin Luther insisted that each man and woman be responsible for his or her relation to the Creator, which required a great social innovation, universal literacy so any person could read the Bible and make up his mind for himself as to what it meant."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I am very pleased, excellent insight and valuable information which I am now using in everyday life as well as business"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"book was in very good shape and was shipped in a timely manner. would definitely buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Does teach you alot of things..its a great but a long book..takes you a while to finish up..uses more advanced approach..I would say by reading it all..its good to put these things in practice..but shouldnt be totally effected by thier ideas,,cuz they do talk about God there but in a hypocritical manner...just take a look at the words are used as heading \\"Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical & Financial Destiny\\"I m little against this idea...

I started to listen to Tony's speech every evening just before I went to bed. He is a great speaker. However, I like him because everything he is talking about is either my personal experience or I know it through a friend/relative. He is not talking about big secrets neither promises miracles. He just says how people should change the way they think in order to get out of depression and stand up after a tragic event (like death of a close relative or loosing a great job) or anything which does not allow them to live a happy life.

By that, I mean they can really heal inner wounds while you are reading it, but afterwards, it doesn't really last. I blame the complexity of Robbin's techniques. NLP is no beginner concept. Personally, I found it too complicated to effectively apply to my life. There are lots of great ideas in this book, but they are only as great as how well you remember them and use them to empower your life. So why the four stars? Well, yes, I do remember one concept from this book. One that is so powerful that I use it as my eternal goal in life in addition to my other more specific goals: the concept of CANI - Constant And Never-Ending Improvement. With this goal, you will never fail in life."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"After reading the psycho-babble of the reader from Los Angeles, I had to comment. I am familiar with all of that and if it gets you out of bed in the morning--great. Tony Robbins book has been a key for drawing together a lot that I know but have not been able to put into practice. I have learned that simplicity is really quite a good determinant of wisdom. If I can't understand something, how can I accomplish it? Awaken The Giant Within is very exciting to me because I can check what is said against my experience. Robbins is not &quot;the expert&quot; who's words cannot be verified, but must be taken on trust. Rather, He states his case and you are free to test it out. By me early tests, the book holds up, and I would be able to recomend it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I received this book from my boss, who found it at a flea market. We aren't into self-help books, but this one intrigued him I suppose, and since he didn't have time to read it, he passed it onto me to see what I thought.I totally laughed when he gave it to me. After all, the only place I had seen Tony Robbins was on SNL or Mad TV being made fun of. The guy with the big teeth and goofy hair. Give me a break. But what the heck, I love to read, so I read it.I have now read the book 3 times. It is that good, in my opinion.Some critics have accused it of being full of \\"fluff\\". I can see how they would perceive that, but the useful info far outweighs what one would consider \\"fluff\\".One man's \\"fluff\\" is another man's treasure!I also expected him to plug his seminars, and other readers were under the impression that he did so constantly. I didn't think so at all!!!

NLP techniques have been eliminated from the book and I view that as a positive. Significant time is spent educating the reader on the importance of self understanding and examination of the inner self. Generating lists of personal goals, beliefs and values is once again encouraged. The importance of expanding your vocabulary in order to be a more effective communicator is discussed in detail. In fact, if the reader only views the chapters dedicated to vocabulary expansion and utilizes the authors suggestions the effects on your life will be profound. Once again, I believe that Mr. Robbins has provided the reader with an excellent starting point to self improvement."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"So many people have written such accolades for Robbins' work, that I hesitate to add my 2 cent's worth. But this book is excellent. It's also disturbing - especially to many psychotherapist. Not because the disagree with Robbins's theories, but rather because they dislike how much money he makes. I suspect they're simply jealous. The fact is, that Robbins shows that self mastery is really quite easy, as long as one remains committed. If you doubt your own abilities in any way, read this book.

What turned me around was a warning he gave on YouTube about the looming financial crisis in the USA. I never expected that from him. Made me view him favorably. If the guy could be truthful about a bad situation, and not gloss over it with a bunch of Positive Mental Attitude crap, maybe he was an authentic person. So I bought this book. I read Think and Grow Rich and Psychocybernetics years ago and loved them both and reread them both. I have found every other author to merely regurgiate their concepts. This books does that too, but also offers concrete tools for setting your mind to think at the 50,000 foot level as far as goals go. He shares the methodology he used to arrive at decisions, the self-talk he had with himself, the adjustments he made along the way. I found it to be a very personal book.

First, the premise on which the entire program rests--that we, by nature, seek pleasure and avoid pain--is faulty. The idea is due to Jeremy Bentham, one of the founders of Utilitarianism. But this idea is an unfalsifiable generalization. It cannot be demonstrated to be either true, or false. It adds nothing to our understanding of human nature or of the various predicaments that we find ourselves in. Most of the work is based on simplistic assumptions about human nature and social conditions. It overstates the power of individuals to better their existence. Lots of things are out of our hands, and the power of reason is much more limited than Robbins assumes. Another problem you may find is that the approach used by Robbins is actually a mosaic of fragments of different approaches. He readily combines operant conditioning from behavioral psychology with Pavlovian conditioned reflex, and has elements of the cybernetic theory of mind woven into the fabric of his work, as well. Watch out: A highfalutin mumbo-jumbo that sounds like it's easy to use is seductive! What Robbins offers is not science, but it has some similarities with art. His is a pump-up, feel good approach, not much different than that of his competitors, but delivered with more passion, conviction, and charisma. However, you can take this advice for free and achive the same or better results that you can get by speding money on Robbins' products: Like yoursefl, respect yourself, and try to respect others whenever possible. As far as broader principles of life and society are concerned, don't spend your money on superfluous literature of handsome young men."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Of all the questions that have boggled the human mind through the ages I have one more question to add to the litany of unanswerables:How is it that people fall for self-promoting hucksters like Robbins time and time again?It should be quite obvious that Robbins real success lies in telling you repeatedly how successful he is.He has not amassed a $300,000,000 dollar fortune by any financial genius but merely by selling the idea of success.As they say,nothing sells like success.It is not that Robbins gives bad advice but only that it is adrenaline-rush excitement that abates in a few hours.His books,tapes etc. are sort of like heavy metal music:it is inspiring for a few minutes and makes you feel as though you could go up to the biggest guy on the street and whip his tail,but as soon as the adrenaline rush wears off and you come to your senses you realize how ridiculous your momentary delusions really were.Ten minutes after you've finished reading Robbins you realize that you've read the bluster of an exceptional used car salesman.Of course,the selling never ends.If you want to be an even greater success you'll need to attend Robbins seminars at two or three thousand bucks a clip.Of course these seminars lead to more seminars.The Church of Scientology has the same kind of racket.I imagine that is precisely whre Robbins got his inspiration.In the end,Robbins books and advice are squarely in line with the heap of new age blather and nonsense.Human beings never change until they want to change or have to change.All the cheerleading and toothy smiles and feel-good pap in the world can't change the fact.By the way,don't miss his QVC appearances.They're a hoot!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Robbins has a lot of good ideas but he is a terrible writer.

I bought this in 1993 -- read the chapter on power words and then put it down. 5 years later it dropped off the bookshelf and I read it through -- energized by the concepts within. 5 years later I am again working with Tony's material.The question is &quot;Why did I wait so long?&quot; Perhaps one has to be ready to take advantage of the tool. Look at all the people who are still alcoholics even though AA has been in existance since the early 1930s. And AA is FREE! This goes straight to the heart of Tony's argument that we are all motivated by pain and pleasure. Alcoholics don't go to AA because in their perception IT IS MORE PAINFUL TO QUIT THAN TO KEEP ON DRINKING.Tony didn't invent the basic NLP concepts in this book -- Bandler and Grindler did in the late 70s. It was nothing short of a breakthrough in understanding how our minds work. It is interesting to me that NLP has not gotten more press because clearly it is a breakthrough in helping people change. There are perhaps smarter NLP people than Robbins. I would consider Tad James a genius in this genre as he invented some of the theory.Robbins' genuius is PACKAGING NLP in a way that the masses could quickly understand and relate to, not just &quot;experts.&quot; The swish techniques mentioned need to be done repeatedly. They are not a quick fix. Do you learn to play the piano by playing scales once? Do you get good at a sport by doing it once or once in awhile? It is the same principle. You are &quot;conditioning&quot; yourself to get your outcome good or bad. The techniques used to condition new behavior need to be repeated. Sorry you people out there who don't want to work for what you get in life. In case you didn't get it yet ALL ACHIEVEMENTS IN LIFE REQUIRE REPEATED EFFORT OVER TIME.This book is chockful of useful techniques that work. The good news is that ANYONE CAN DO THEM BUT NOT EVERYONE WILL.I am neither a robbins cultist nor a skeptic. I respect hard work and perseverance. I do not respect people who are too lazy to write their own books or try to better life for others -- and trash the good works of others to make themselves feel better(AH ANOTHER PLEASURE MOTIVATOR!)about what THEY ARE NOT ACHIEVING IN THEIR OWN LIVES.The bottom line is -- if you are interested in change, buy this book. But realize that you may have to try again and again before you get successful. Remember Edison tried 10,000 times before he found what made electricity work. Where would we be if he gave up at 9,999?"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"In chapter 17: References; The Fabric of Life. Robbins discusses the importance of references. But where are the references to support his statements? I couldn't find any. When I went to the back of this book which where references are typically located, all I found were advertisements for Robbins.While Robbins talks about how he used to live in a 40 square foot apartment washing dishes in his bathtub, he never explains what he did to reach his level of wealth. Of course we all know what he did; he sold books, tapes and seminars.Notice the 5 star reviewers (probably Robbins emloyees) use the same lines but also neglect to say what they didto change their lives and attain such great success.How can Anthony expect anybdy to take him seriously? I recommend Norman Vincent Peales book, You can if You Think You can and Miracle Power by Joseph Murphy. I also recommend introduction to NLP by Joseph O'Connor and Instant Rapport by Michael Brooks.If you must read this one by Robbins, borrow it at the library. You'll find it there. Robbins is the greatest self promoter of the last 100 years."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"If value were weight, this would be one of the three heaviest books in the universe.

I wouldn't even bat an eye choosing &quot;Awaken the Giant Within.&quot; And I dearly love Mercedes.This one book dramatically upgrades the hardware we call the human brain. It makes it about a hundred times easier to accomplish whatever you want to accomplish. It won't turn you into a Tony clone. It will bring the very best of YOU out easily.I owe my life and my web site to a great coach by the name of Tony Robbins. His work really did dramatically upgrade my mental hardware.

I'm still taking a lot of action, very different action."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Obviously Tony Robbins is a very committed and intense individual. That is worth 3 stars. But, a self-help book should be just that: a book that enables you to help yourself, so you don't need to use Tony or his seminars or tapes for constant reinforcement.The book is applicable to everyday life situations, but the practicality is questionable. Everything he writes has been said before, and could be distilled down to a few lines that you could concentrate on, as has been done by other Spiritualists. Instead, you need to remember 6 NAC steps, 5 problem solving questions, 10 emotions of power, 6 steps to emotional mastery, 10 Action signals, 6 Master steps to change, and the list goes on. Whew! You need a briefcase just to carry all that around with you.The bottom line is no one is going to remember all those steps.

I was 35, selling cars, making less than $35,000 a year, fat, a smoker, and wondering where all the supposed \\"promise\\" I had ever went. I had a few good years in the past, but they were long gone. I didn't just read this book, I consumed it. Like Baptists read the Bible I read this book, and I started a success journal. Now, 3 years later. I work for myself (if you can call doing whatever I want work) and make $10,000 - $15,000 per month. I work out 6 days a week, I don't smoke, every relationship I have with everyone I love is 3x better than it ever has been.I read \\"motivation\\", \\"self-help\\" and \\"how to succeed\\" books since I was 19 years old. And I did my best to follow them... not much happened in the end. This book, when Tony said \\"do this\\", I did it and there was an INSTANT change. Instant change after Instant change turned into the beginnings of a new life after 6 months, the taste of freedom after 18 months, and now unstoppable, unflappable, unimaginable success and happiness for a guy with a high school degree and never a penny in the bank before my next paycheck (until after Tony Robbins).

I've bought his books, I own his audio programs and I've been to his UPW seminar. His message is one of empowerment, of raising your standards in your life, of accepting more, of doing more, of becoming more.Some people may wonder, ok, how specifically has this book helped me? What specifically have I done in my own life:Change starts by raising your own standards for yourself. I got around empowering and more positive people. I joined the public speaking group Toastmasters and have had a fun time overcoming a fear I once had (at age 23). I got out of the &quot;matrix&quot; of society of accepting a 9-5 job, working for 40 years, etc. To borrow one of Tonys phrases, I'm designing a life instead of just making a living. Doing work that I really enjoy.I realized how important it is to have focus and have a vision for yourself. Focusing on what's most important in your life. His time management products are excellent.I learned that I have more control over my own state than I thought I had before reading his books or attending his seminars. That distinction alone can change your life.Asking yourself quality questions, the power of your beliefs, CANI, these are all incredibly valuable things to learn. And to USE. That's the most important part.Although I'm a huge fan of his, I don't believe everything he says 100%. The part about relationships, some of his health tips, even some of his financial wisdom. And the NAC and NLP material I never really used. Absolutely, be a critical thinker. Use what works for you.To Tonys detractors, I just don't understand the negativity. Everyone borrows from everyone; that's not a big revelation, is it? Even Napoleon Hill got his material from somewhere. Steven Speilberg didn't invent story telling either. These aren't new concepts, but if you're being exposed to it for the first time, it doesn't really matter where you get it from. Some of it may seem like common sense, but unfortunately, alot of people never learn or use it. Regardless of his master persuasion and selling skills, I think Tony has done alot of positive things for people. The results he's produced for people speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I first picked up this book in 1995... didn't get serious into reading it, as i just browsed through. But even as i was just browsing, I realised how intelligent this guy was. He is happy, has lots of motivation, lots of Personal Power, and he makes lots of sense. The thing is that we think many things he writes about we already know (they make sense) but our BIGGEST problem is that we KNOW WHAT TO DO, BUT WE DON'T DO WHAT WE KNOW! Or perhaps we aren't persistant enough. Tony says :&quot;Knowing doesn't change your life, doing does. You got to take MASSIVE action.&quot; But how? He offers you his STRATEGIES! Some of them are so simple you'll even suspect if they'll work. BUt if you try them consistantly, you'll know they do! Then in 1999 i reread it again (more seriously this time) and bang! My life changed. I applied what he said and I dropped my shyness and insecurities. I became more passionate, confident, outspoken. Achieved my goals. I was so shy before but now I can walk up to anyone to stike a conversation, even strangers. I became so confident that I walk up to girls and ask them out for dates. I realised that if you are shy or unhappy, it's because you have RULES that sabotage you, and yet you think they are the 'right' rules. And your values contridict each other, you go up one day, then down the next. No consistency! If you are going to get anything out of this book, you've got to read it thoroughly. And I tell you once you get your rules and values right, you'll fell congruent and happy. And you'll be clear of what you want, what to do."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Hi all, I originally wrote a review for this book back in 1998.See 'Easy and exciting to read, with amazing results., January 11, 1998Reviewer: A reader'That was me! At that time I was back in the UK and finishing up in University. In my original review, I emphasised how easy it is to apply the lessons that Mr. Robbins suggests in this book. Having recently reviewed the posts near to mine, I noticed something very interesting. Very few posts have been marked as 'helpful' where the post is giving the book a positive review. But WOW! Look at all the 'helpful' agreements for all those that have something negative to say about it!!Those people who say nothing good about it, obviously haven't applied the everyday principles to their lives, to help themselves. Now, I'm not suggesting that one should solely rely on just this book for all their advice. Indeed, one should seek confirmation from other sources if needed. But, since reading the book, almost 8 years ago; and giving the review nearly 7 years ago; I have to tell ya, whenever I've hit bad patches, I've referred to the teachings of Mr. Robbins and put myself back on track!!Almost 15 years ago I lost everything I had to my then partner. She took the lot, including our daughter, whom she later gave up for adoption. To this day I have never been able to trace her. (Lots of reasons stand in the way). I tried for several years to get over the depression, even seeking counselling from therapists. Nothing worked. I realised, only I know ME like ME! Mr. Robbin's book helped me understand areas of my life that were in a mess. It helped me to sort them out. In essence, what it did was help me discover myself and my OWN learning processes of success in ALL areas. Including beating severe depression. If you're feeling suicidal, trust me, you're reading this book review because somewhere in your soul and heart, you KNOW there's something better for you ahead in your life, and you're simply seeking answers to sort it out. Suicide is NOT the way. WHATEVER negativity you're feeling in your life right now, you CAN change it by applying the lessons from this book! The authors of book reviews that talk negatively, failed to continue learning. Simple as that.Today, 15 years later, I have achieved EVERYTHING I set out to achieve to end the depression in life. I went to college, then University, and am now married, with a 3 year old son. Also, I now successfully own TWO businesses that I started from scratch, and make more money now than I ever thought possible! Why? Because I learned to believe in MY OWN POWER of change - thanks to Awaken The Giant Within!Not every word is necessary, and this is made clear in the book. Just use what you need! I don't need the book anymore, but I KNOW, I couldn't have reached my goals today, without the invaluable advice from Mr. Robbins. I apply the lessons whenever I'm hit with negativity - which usually comes from those that don't stick with anything long enough to make the changes they seek! That or those who have plenty of 'advice' to dish out about what YOU'RE doing wrong, because it's 'Not what I would do if I were in your shoes!'. Well, guess what, they're NOT in your shoes are they? So how can they possibly know what's right for you unless they experienced the same thing and changed it? Ever get business advice from someone who doesn't own a business? Ever experienced someone telling you how to raise your kids even though they don't have any of their own? This is YOUR life, and Mr. Robbins simply helps you take it back! He did so for me, and he can do for you!A million thank yous Mr. Robbins!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I first saw Tony Robbins on the Joan Rivers show back in 1993. I was very impressed by his charisma and energy, but like many others, felt that Tony Robbins was just a salesman trying to dupe the naive into buying his books and then all of the other products, seminars etc. At work, I ran into a friend who was radiant (unusual for her) and unusually bubbly She told me some of the changes in her life that were taking place and she had begun to read this book: &quot;Awaken the Giant&quot; What really impressed me were the changes that started taking place in the days and weeks that folowed. She started to lose weight, was participating more in meetings at work, and then got promoted. I was impressed. So I decided that this must work. I went out and bought Awaken the Giant and began to use the techniques such as &quot;the swish pattern&quot; and&quot;scrambling technique&quot; Awaken the Giant is a huge book, but I read it in one week. My job performance improved immediately as did my tennis game. I got immediate and dramatic results. This is not just a &quot;feel good book&quot; the techniques really work. My girlfriend also recommended that I read &quot;More Wealth without Risk&quot; by Charles Givens. She told me that More Wealth without Risk did as much for her on a Financial Level than Awaken the Giant did on a personal development level. I went out and read that book and I got equally dramatic results from a financial perspective. I highly recommend both books to anyone who wants to dramatically change their lives...and quickly!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I must confess that after seeing Tony Robbins informercial, I thought he was the king of hype. Then our local Waldens had Awaken the Giant and Unlimited Power on sale for $2.99 each! At that price, I figured how could I go wrong.Much to my surprise, the techniques worked. Swish patterns and anchors have helped me tremendously. Now having experienced remarkable results, I would have gladl paid the full cover price for each plus some more.If you are in business or in a managerial position, then I highly recommend Direct from Dell by Mike Dell. Great book for anyone in a leadership role.Thank you Tony for your great work."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I first saw Anthony Robbins many years ago on the Joan Rivers show along with Charles Givens. Both were talking about success and hawking their respective books; Awaken The Giant and More Wealth Without Risk.What impressed me about Awaken The Giant is that it is not just &quot;feel good&quot; stuff that gives a puffy, artificial high. Tony Robbins offers real meaty advice that works and works right away.NAC or NLP offers fast and permanent change. I had a stuttering problem. After using Tony's methods--gone. Not in months or weeks but right away.I also had a fear of public speaking. When my manager called upon me to speak to our group, I was petrified initially. But after following Tony's advice, using swish patterns and installing anchors, the fear was gone and everyone complimented me on my performance.It didn't take weeks, it took one application.Since then, I have been able to flatten my fears, overcome lifelong phobias e.g. fear of snakes and public speaking. I have made rapid and permanent changes.Awaken The Giant is a great book. It will unleash the giant sleeping inside of you and h elp you reach whatever goals you can realistically set and go for.I also recommend More Wealth Without Risk, a book that does for personal finance what Awaken The Giant does for you on a personal development level and also SuperSelf, another great book by Charles Givens that offers personal development strategies different from what is in Tony Robbins book."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I enjoyed AWAKEN THE GIANT and feel that this book gave me a new lease on life. It's very easy to read, entertaining, uplifting as well as informational. Tony Robbins has the ability to get you to &quot;take action&quot; like no one else.If you just read the book, you'll get knowledge. If you read and apply that knowledge by doing the exercises, you'll get results like you've never seen before!I also subscribe to Tony's &quot;PowerTalk&quot; Program and highly endorse it. Nobody communicates with the power of ROBBINS.As a result of &quot;PowerTalk&quot; I've been building my library as per Robbins recommendations. I particularly enjoyed Barbara DeAngelis &quot;Are you the one for me&quot; and Charles Givens &quot;Wealth without Risk&quot; and the related interviews with Tony on the &quot;PowerTalk&quot; Tapes. In fact, if anyone had to pick just three books that would substantially turn their life's around, the three best books would be 1)Awaken the Giant-perso! ! nal development and achievement, 2)Are you the one for me?-relationships and to ignite that passion in your life and, 3) Wealth without Risk-for building and keeping wealth.So thank you TONY ROBBINS for not only helping me reach a new level of personal achievement with your book and tapes, BUT also for recommending DEANGELIS &amp; GIVENS.

In October '99 I attended one of Anthony Robbins' seminars, albeit reluctantly dragged to it by my boyfriend (I too was a cynic). Two years before that I had attempted suicide, been admitted to several psychiatric hospitals and was on a huge amount of medication for a 'mental disorder' as well as various painful physical ailments. I was addicted to sleeping pills, was unemployed, overweight, depressed and often violent. Anthony Robbins' seminar inspired me enough to test out the merit of his claims by quitting smoking and no longer taking medications and I embarked on the vegan diet he suggested. Within a week I was feeling wonderful and decided to improve other areas of my life. Reading 'Awaken' has given me new insights into how I can improve and it is great as a handbook to remind you of how you can be at your best - but by all means GO to one of his seminars. Be sceptical, but also be eclectic and use to information he gives - if you want happiness enough, you can have it! This book is an excellent distillation of ideas. Start with the physical and go from there if you need proof that his ideas work. Anyone who believes they can perform at their best while eating animal products is kidding themselves - become vegan and you will understand how energetic, vital and balanced you can really feel. I have been totally vegan for 4 months and I lost 25kg effortlesly and now maintain a stable weight of 57kg. Everyone is amazed at how wonderful I look. Also, I practice the breathing techniques every day and use his simple NLP techniques to control my anger. Anthony Robbins is a fantastic guide.There is always room for improvement. It works - just give it a try!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Yes, I too thought Tony Robbins was just a huckster when I saw him doing those infomercials on TV. I mean, the guy was just so sales-ish, so excited. In my case, it was seeing Tony on QVC that turned me around. I was already reading \\"self-help\\" type books like Covey's \\"7 Habits of Highly-Effective People\\" and I believe that you should wake up and put yourself in the driver's seat of your own life. I watched Tony take live on-air phone calls from people on QVC, answering their questions and giving them individual, REAL answers. He was smart, empathetic, and THERE in the moment for that caller. I was very impressed, and thought, what the hey - I'll buy the book. Well, unlike other books such as Covey's, Robbins materials are more about work! They contain tools and mental exercises and to-do lists. In other words, they are like learning ABC's for your mind. You have to practice and work on yourself. You can't just read it and voila! your life changes overnight. I didn't expect that to happen, but some naysayers out there probably expect that. Robbins gives you the tools you need to get to working on yourself. Is it hard to change your habits? You bet! Is it difficult to change yourself? Your ways of thinking? It is the most difficult thing you'll ever do. But with Tony's materials, it's easier because he gives you a blueprint. He doesn't just tell you again what we all already know - anger is bad, eat well, lose weight, don't be sad, yadda, yadda. He gives you examples and tools for how to get out of that rut so that you can change from sad to happy, broke to whatever.

I must tell you, I am surprised to see so much negativity. But then you have to step back and ask why? I would have to say that most of the negative reviews where because people thought they where going to purchase a book and open it up, then the next morning they would be rich and happy. As ridiculous as it may sound, that is really what they believed deep within themselves. I will tell you that this was the first book I purchased of Robbins. I APPLIED the material to my life and went from a depressed kid that worked in a restaurant to a happy person that now makes six digits trading stock, as my father would say, \\"not bad for a twenty-two year old\\". Did Robbins do this, no I did. Robbins did teach me how to apply my attitude and skills to master my financial, physical, time, emotional and relationship skills. If you are looking for a simple, easy, no effort needed, way to change your life, then this is not the book. If you are looking to take your life to another level and are tired of being confused on how to do it, then this is the book. By the way, someone said that he charges a lot for his seminars and that is how he makes money. This is true, but he is the only one that I know that gives a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee on everything he sells. So, obviously what he gets for his seminars must be worth it, or he would be out of business by now.

It's easy to sit on the sidelines and say, \\"Oh, yeah, that guy, that guy just wants to make money...\\" Of course, the guy wants to make money, but I also believe that you can make money and do what is yours to do; if that is giving seminars, and making infomercials, or writing books, then so be it!I am a Spiritual Counselor myself and when I first started charging clients, I really felt guilty about it. Who am I to charge for my services? Actually, you really do owe it to the client to charge. It is a fact that when people don't pay for \\"services rendered\\" they don't appreciate it as much as when they do pay.I do have certain talents. I do have certain skills. I do have certain gifts and I do, gosh dernit, deserve to charge for my time with a person and that is what I'm really charging for; my time. You don't expect to not pay a mechanic who fixes your car? No! You pay him for parts and labor...in other words, time.So, yeah, Tony Robbins is making a fortune doing what he does. I don't begrudge him a thing. He is excellent in what he does. I once attended a seminar of his and I wasn't just motivated to go out and just \\"do\\" something, I was inspired to \\"become\\" something.It is all in your intent, people. Who do you intend to become? What do you intend to do? What do you intend to have? If we came into each and every day with a list of intents and happily handed them over to our Higher Power without any kind of restrictions or resistance, oh, my God...tge results would be astounding.So, don't hate Tony just because he's beautiful...and he truly is, the guy is just a vibrant soul that exudes certainty, faith, and dignity, love him for what he's trying to do; heal the world one person at a time.Peace and Blessings..."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I'm not going to say this is a bad book. It's very motivating and if that's what you need than this will do the trick. However if you're someone who is already motivated, but is just stuck, then this is not for you. I was stuck and looking for practical tools to get me unstuck. I tried this book plus Tony's 30 day Personal Power kit & found them to be pretty much the same. They're meant to put fire under the butts of those who lack it. Since fire isn't my issue it didn't work for me. I also found it weird that Tony teaches in these about relationships & marriages and how to make marriage work etc.. when he himself carried on an extensive affair with the woman he's married to now WHILE he was married to his first wife. The woman he's married to now was at that point also married.. oy yoi yoi YOU want to charge ME 5 grand for one of your Relationship workshops? No thanks.I believe in looking into someone's history before taking their word. And Tony started as a salesman from a very young age- and that's all he's done ever since. He's never had any other type of job than sales, and he began selling \\"success\\" from when he was teenager! So in other words he has made his own success exactly FROM talking about how to make you successful. He promotes, he sells, He gets the fire burning under you. That's what he's been doing pretty much since he was 19. But he doesn't have the background to tell managers how to manage their firms & certainly doesn't have the success in relationships to tell people how to have golden relationships. Yet he conducts events where he tries to \\"sell\\" this in a way. I'm not saying he's wrong to do this or that he's a hypocrite (well, when it comes to the relationships & marriage techniques he is, but that's another story). I'm saying that Tony's books & events mirror his life's work in that- they get you motivated to DO..to take action. But they don't do much more than that.

(The power of metaphors and the fact that questions guide our thoughts.)I respect the rest of the book, but these chapters alone are worth the purchase.(I am an Instructor of NLP.)"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Anthony Robbins is the first person that I modeled that really changed my life for the better. Before him, I have read other books on psychology and self-improvement, but all those just ended up with lots of theories about things, but very little practical application in real life.Robbins is the person who walks his talk. He takes what he learned and modelled from other masters like Jim Rohn, Robert Shuller, Richard Bandler, Milton Erickson, Robert Cialdini and many others, but he does something different and achieve far greater results than his teachers. The reason is that he takes all the techniques seriously and apply them faithfully to the n-th degree. Few of his very powerful beliefs he lives by that I have used to achieve impossible achievements are &quot;There is ALWAYS a way, If I am committed to find one&quot;, &quot;It is in the moments of your decisions that your destiny is shaped&quot;, &quot;Manage your emotional states and you master your behaviours&quot;.If you read about his story, he was 17 years old, broke and living in his VW car outside 7-11, and he joined Jim Rohn's company to start selling Rohn's educational sets. And he sold to every single person he made a sales appointment with, just by applying what he learned from Jim Rohn and others. Even Jim Rohn couldn't believe it, since nobody in the company could sell more than this 17 year old kid. And when he was broke, he set such goals as owning a castle home, big cars, being successful etc, and in 1 year he achieved them all, just by rehearsing and staying committed to his goals every day. And over the years, he achieved amazing redults just by applying the skills, beliefs, and techniques he learned. He proved to me that, if you are committed to your goals, values, and committed to doing the things you MUST do each day to be at your best,- then you can do seemingly amazing things even with simple techniques and beliefs.This cassette is an additional companion to his book Awaken The Giant Within. Although the publisher produced this tape, which is about 60 - 90 minutes, some of the information and techniques in the book are not included here. But I love this tape as his delivery is very powerful and infectious. Get this tape, I guarantee it will help you, IF you apply them in your life. Don't be like most people who reads good books, and then say it's not good, just because they don't apply what they read. Reading and merely listening won't change your life. Applying it does! The world is filled with educated derelicts- people who know a lot of knowledge, but didn't use what they know."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Anthony Robbins is a famous writer, motivational trainer, speaker and celebrity. Most people in the US know him as the tall, energetic self-help guy on television. He first reached acclaim with his book Unlimited Power and is highly regarded for his specific techniques to re-train yourself to be a happy, motivated and successful person.While the size and content of the book is somewhat overwhelming, the premise of this book is quite simple: You have the power to live the way you want, but you have to coach and train yourself to do it.Things don't change. We change. - Henry David ThoreauThe first step to any change is a decision. Not a passing interest, or desire, but a firm decision. The word decision comes from the Latin word (de-caedere) for to cut. It means that you cut away any other possibilities. Interestingly, there is a similar word in Korean (GYUL DAHN). These words indicate finality. It is the end of one thing and the beginning of another. Decisions are not just logical conclusions, but acts of willingness and commitments to action.The next step is to train the body and the mind to accept this change. Robbins explains that we have neural associations (physical nerve connections in the brain) with certain behaviors, and unless we change those associations, we cannot change our behavior. Simply, if our brain likes smoking (more than it hates it) ~ we cannot stop smoking. To stop, you must associate more pain (than pleasure) to the action. At times it seems obvious, but it is a practical way to teach yourself to change.Finally, any change must be reinforced through repetition. As we all know too well, it is difficult to give up a bad habit and even more difficult to keep a good one. As Aristotle said, \\"We are what we repeatedly do\\"While reading this book, I had to take breaks periodically to digest what Robbins was saying. While he writes in a simple and readable way, the objective of the book is quite large and comprehensive: change your life. It is a serious subject and it requires some open-mindedness. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants to change some aspect of their life, and wants to know the actionable steps to affect that change."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"The book has some great information that, when applied, can make some significant changes in a person's life. After reading numerous other works from authors in the self-help and academic arena, I discovered that a lot of what Mr. Robbins shares is the work of other people who paid the price to learn the techniques and methods. The information is based on sound research, yet very little is credited to the researchers. Just one of numerous examples is the concept of NAC. Mr. Robbins was in a legal dispute for using NLP, so he simply changed the name, added a few twists, and voila -- a new change technology. The information gets an &quot;A&quot;, but Mr. Robbins gets a &quot;D-&quot; for ethics."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I'm in the sales game, and thought I could pick up some good techniques to 'Awaken My Giant'. Tony Robbins writes in a jumbled manner, switching from one self-serving story to another. What is your point, Tony? Please get to the techniques already! 'Awaken' has a lot of pages and information, but it's like trying to put together a two-sided puzzle. This book is for robbins' loyalists who've seen the guy live. It is nauseating to read his continual chest-thumping tripe. That story about getting a tear in his eye when travelling via helicopter to a seminar made me laugh out loud. PAAAAHLEEEEEZE. And the 20 trips to Fiji to see where he wanted to buy his dream house on 120 acres, and don't forget all those celebs he hobnobs. Let's get real Tony!Pass up this book! The only thing I got from it is to 1) MAKE MORE DECISIONS 2) FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF 3) DON'T DO THINGS THAT WILL CAUSE LONG-TERM PAIN 4) REWARD YOURSELF WHEN YOU DO THE 'GOOD' THINGS. There, I just saved you 12 bucks."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Unlike the person who wrote their review before mine, I actually applied what Tony Robbins teaches in the book. By applying the techniques he describes in this book (and Unlimited Power) I changed my life, for the better, forever. This stuff WORKS if YOU CHOOSE to put the lessons into practice (optimal word &quot;CHOOSE&quot;). Case in point: I first read this book when it first came out in hardcover. Using the techniques in the book, I set out on a quest of eleven goals. These were things I really wanted to change in my life. There were many things in my life that were holding me back and the book specifically instructed me how to change my limiting beliefs and turn pain into action. At the time I wrote my goals, I had absolutely no idea how I was going to achieve them. Here I am seven years later and I achieved every single goal! Every one! From losing 40 pounds (and keeping it off by staying in shape), to finding the woman of my dreams and marrying her, to owning a very successful business. You can &quot;choose&quot; to be cynical and say the contents of this book are superficial and it's only &quot;feel good&quot; literature. To the contrary, in my experience, the lessons contained within the pages of this book are powerful! If you're reading these reviews to help determine if you should buy the book, do not let any nay-sayers influence your decision. For the cost of a mere dinner at a restaurant, you can possess the keys to unlocking your potential. I have never met Tony Robbins. But if I ever get the chance to meet him, I'll sound like a broken record just like the thousands of others who have been incredibly impacted by his powerful teachings."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"There is absolutely no way that the U.S. Army, the British House of Lords, the President of the United States, the British House of Commons, Xerox, IBM, American Express, Erin Brockavich, and Andre Agassi (among others) would all rely on Tony Robbins for regular coaching if he lacked credibility.Tony Robbins is not some corporate lame-duck pulling a marketing scam. He is THE recognized authority on organizational and personal turn-around, both here in the US and abroad. The facts speak for themselves. When I read reviews which berate Tony Robbins, they just prove that the people who wrote them are inferior in the realm of self-discipline. No one can force anyone to change. No one can force you out of bed in the morning. No one can hand you your goals on a silver platter. What Tony provides is one hell of a roadmap to get back on the highway of success. He himself says that unless you carefully apply the principles regularly in Awaken the Giant, it will be worthless. But for those who apply them and dare to be drastic, permanent changes can be made and you will meet with incredible success.Personally, I plan to attend his next seminar in Chicago. In a world run amok with sales hype, there's at least one person selling something worth your money. Let the rabble wallow in self-pity and criticism-- the rest of us will achieve our dreams."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I decided to write a review after reading some of the negative reviews on here. They were actually very thoughtful, well articulated reviews, which usually ended in a promo for some other author's book. But I felt that most of these people are in search of a magic pill, which is probably explains all the plugs for other books.For me, I could care less about who wrote this book, what his credentials are, whether he's a false prophet, or a narcissistic self-promoter. Big bird could have written this book for all I care.I care about how the words in the book resonated with me. I continuously found amazing concepts that I was able to internalize and help develop a conviction that I can transform into a better version of myself. And, a la Tony, a conviction is something we do not question because we have absolute certainty about it. This book helped me develop that conviction that no matter what, I will always be improving my state of being and the quality of my life.I've internalized many of the concepts from this book. One major concept is that we can physically re-wire our brains, creating powerful neurological pathways that allow us to move towards feeling good all the time, while dissolving the old pathways that led us into pain, and ultimately into reading this book. Eventually, it is actually harder to develop those old feelings of pain than it is to experience the new feelings of pleasure.This book provided me with great clarity as to how our brains operate and how we experience pleasure and pain. With this new-found sense of clarity, I have actually been able to develop my own concepts and guidelines that I follow to constantly improve my state.If you're looking for a magic pill, don't read this book. Then again, magic pills don't exist."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book is a must. Tony really knows how to motive you. The book goes into detail how to change old habits, etc. The cd is great to listen to in the car. But the book is so much more detailed. If you need to take control of your life, this is the guy who can help you."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I've read quite a few books in the personal development genre and I think this is one of the better ones. I read some of the one star reviews that criticize the author because he got a divorce. Although I'm somewhat old fashioned on this issue too, I think judging this book based on that is a serious mistake. The only question is whether the author offers insights and strategies that you can use to improve your life. The answer to this question is a resounding yes. While you won't agree with everything in the book or find everything relevant, I think there's no question that you will find many useful ideas. If nothing else, it will reinforce what you already know, but haven't necessarily applied.Another book I like in this genre, but with a bit different focus isLeadership for Life - Your Guide to Becoming A Transformational Leader"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This CD was delivered to me in just one day via Amazon Prime Shipping (free shipping). I really like the CD and I listen to it in my car whenever I want to. I like how it summarizes all that Anthony Robbins talks about. I'm also reading a book called Unlimited Power from him, and he talks about some points that he makes in the book on this CD as well. This is a good inspirational CD and motivates you to take control of your life, realize your true worth, and guides you in the steps you should do to get there."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I believe Tony Robbins is sincere about what he writes in this book. I know we have all been down and out in our life times. Some of us learn from the &quot;school of hard knocks&quot; and others don't. I applaud Tony for rising up above his circumstances and turning his life around.If we could all learn the things Tony teaches in this book, we should be able to get the world by the tail. We would the masters of our destiny and not let the world dicate to us how we live.I CAN AND SHOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EACH AND EVERYONE"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book is definitely one of the greatest self-help books I have ever read. Anthony Robbin's phillsophy comes to life has he tells his readers that they can make all of their dreams come true if they just take control of their lives. Every chapter outlines what has to be done to take care of one's mental, physical, social, fiancial and other goals. His is a well-rounded book that shows how his readers have so much power and how they take so much of their powers and resources for granted."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I was so impressed with this book, that I went and purchased EVERY publication that Tony Robbins has published.

This book reached me profoundly! One can find practical applicitions of Empiricism in this book, and of course, a lot of Operant conditioning. But the bottom line is this book reminded me to hone my dreaming skills once more, and start on the road towards achieving those dreams. To the cynics: Don't look at it as the gospel according to Tony Robbins'--get what you can out of it.

But still he promotes to suppress feelings, instead of release them. He does not understand that suppressed feelings are causing diseases. When he said that he had learned and are learning all techniques, what is about EFT. With EFT everybody can get rid of even traumas in 5 to 10 minutes, so he does not like to learn( EFT,- look it up from the internet, you will be astonished how many pages are showing up). The next point is, why we can not be happy, without demanding anything/any condition, like little children? The inner happiness is the real happiness what we can have our entire life (Goethe). And this is possible for everybody. Meditation and other Asian techniques can help you to develop it. We can learn something from the east....also he can do. Update your knowledge will be great, so many people will profit from this."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I purchased this book a few years back after having read Anthony Robbin's first book 'Unlimited Power.' Though it did take me a little effort to actually get into this book, I am so glad that I did for the lessons that I learned are timeless. Within this book, Robbins mentions how it is possible to change anything within our lives, even if the only change possible is to change how we feel about something that we cannot control.One of the reasons for why I like this book so much is because not only does Anthony teach one some of the most powerfulest tools-of-change at which one can have at their disposal, but the core theme of this books is personal responsibility. By this, I mean choice. Reading this book makes the reader come to see that they are responsible for what happens within their lives, be it good or bad.The one part of the book which I like in particular is Robbin's concept of CANI. Based on the Japanese principle of Kaizen, CANI stands for Continuous and Never-Ending Improvement, which is a new concept on improving the direction of your life.I would recommend this book for anyone wishing to turn their lives around and leave a masterpiece of a life at the end.Beat The Bully: A Guide To Dealing With Adult Bullying"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This is the second copy of this book I have purchased. The first was back in 1998. I wore it out and then lent it out and never saw it again. There are many exercises in this book that can singlehandedly change or improve your life if you only commit to doing them and then using some repetition to groove the new stuff. If you just read casually, it will be interesting stuff, just not life-changing. Tony Robbins is truly a gift to our generation and I only wish he would write some more books to see what he's been up to all these last 10 years for those of us who don't get to seminars much. I did attend one of his 4-day Firewalk Seminars in 2000 and still use some of the \\"distinctions\\" I learned there. That being said, the info in this book is as relevant and useable today as it was in the 90's. You won't regret the money you spend on it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Anthony Robbins spent a great deal of time and energy convincing people that they could break out of the stupor of their lives and reconnect with their dreams. When I first read the book I was homeless, living with friends and suffering from a directionless depression. NLP and NAC are not cure-alls for our psychological ills but giving our problems an honest focus can make a huge difference towards solving them. I didn't transform into an overnight success, it still took many years for me to become balanced and many more to become focused on my career. It takes more than one book to change a persons life but Tony created a great place to start."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts.Anthony Robbins summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) to create quick change. He also presents a tool called Neuro Associative Conditioning (NAC). This technique assists you to condition yourself for success. Robbins applies them in a very practical and useful manner.\\"Awaken The Giant Within\\" is a fantastic book with powerful strategies for those who are perceptive enough to use them. This book will improve your entire life from reaching goals to rapport with others. You can change your limiting beliefs and achieve goals that you thought were out of reach. You can greatly improve your interpersonal relationships. You can be better than your best. You can learn to quit bad habits like smoking or alcoholism or solve your overweight problem. You can overcome fears and phobias.The material is presented in reader friendly way. The material is well organised and flows smoothly throughout and is easy to read and follow.Don't be intimidated by the length of the book as it is very interesting and exciting to read. Robbins gives some very insightful anecdotes that illustrate the practical application of his principles and methods that really work. He methodically, step-by-step, explains how to go about articulating what it is you want, the forces that shape our destiny, and how to harness the power within to create our own destiny.This is recommended reading for those who want to change for the better and are prepared to back up their desire with action."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken the Giant has it's place on bookshelves if for no other reason that it is a workable system to empower a person's entire life.In doing this, Robbins has done an outstanding job to make change techniques applicable to the average person. His previous book, Unlimited Power, conveys Robbins' understanding of NLP and therefore can be claimed to be a book on the subject. The problem with Unlimited Power is that there countless books on NLP by much more reputable and learned authors than Robbins.Awaken the Giant is a book that extends well past his first works and the way I see it, adds tremendous value to the field of positive psychology. How, I hear you mutter? Awaken the Giant, using NLP and conditioning techniques at its core, is a well thought out and cohesive system of change, rather than a collection of insights and techniques as many pure NLP books are. The book really focuses on taking control of your life and how to do it. It is not a book of fluffy half-theories and heart-warming anecdotes as most self help books are.Awaken the Giant never claims to be a book on NLP, and, in fact, takes a main premise of NLP - you have all the resources inside you - and helps organise those resources so they work for you, not against you.The book is a little long, and could have been a bit more concise, however, it is presented in a much user friendly way than Unlimited Power.As an NLPer, I appreciate the outcome Robbins had in mind for this book - a whole system for the average person couldn't tell you the difference between a metaprogram and a submodality, but is probably frustrated with underachieving."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"One of the most complete books that I've read on self improvement.

Very articulated and proper use of syntax. His voice is so penetrating that he impells you doing whatever he asks from you.

OK, I'm not going to bore you with myself who's a stranger to you whom got nothing to do with you, YOu can find plenty of examples of transformation in his book. but this book really concern you it's the book from heaven.However, I think it was a book about american way of thinking. it criticised communism and Chinese way of living here and there, being a hongkongese, this is the one thing which i can't agree, apart from that everything else make sense.I love web surfing and It's on this books I began my book surfing! awaken--&gt; unlimited power ---&gt; bandler ---&gt;.....etc... it's teh starter of my life long search for qualityit's a must for everyone.... to quote a sentence from the book(which is itself a quotation in that book) &quot;it's not what happens to you that matters, it's what you interpret what happens.I hope my book surfing can be somehow supported by Amazon.com :) OR, Anthony will use this as the prologue for his new edition of &quot;Awaken the Giant Within&quot; , well, just kidding actuall I just wanna share with you people how great this book really is.It's also better than steven covey's &quot;7 rabbits of highly defective people&quot; (just kidding the title, I hope Covey doesn't mind.) well it's a cool book too, but I find Awaken the giant closer to me, Their difference lies in style and practicality, one is rheotic and the other is very user friendly ( you can see how user friendly this is when I, as a foreign reader only use the dictionary 3 or 4 times.) the differenc! e is like that between an OPERA and a MOVIE.

I found it better than the Success Journal that came with the $200 set of tapes. It is hard to think that if you followed through (took action) on these ideas that some part of your life wouldn't be permanently changed for the better.This would be a great book for someone thinking about buying the tapes but not quite sure.

Early self-help books, like Wayne W. Dyer's &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot; and Norman Vincent Peale's &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; just offered a load of good wishes and positivity. This one really is an advance, because it contains many cognitive techniques - imaging, association, manipulation of vocabulary - that are widely used by therapists and coaches. No, Robbins didn't invent anything in here. A lot of it he stole from Richard Bandler and John Grinder, the developers of Neuro-linquistic programming. But if you can get past the silliness of his persona, his presentation of these ideas and his positivity really are winning. He is a damn good inspirer.

Even today there isn't much new written about such concepts as transformational vocabulary, global metaphors, and empowering questions. While the stories are somewhat outdated, I think this book stands up well even today. I look forward to any new works by Mr. Robbins. It's very surprising to me that this work and Unlimited Power are his only real original books written to date (the others are take-offs). Any new reader should own both and perhaps an audio program as well."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"While a lot of Robbins' philosophy is very outdated and plain wrong (especially his behaviourist idea that all human behaviour is motivated by pleasure/pain), there are techniques in here which definitely bring results when carried out.

It changed my life forever. To the people reading this, here is what I believe to be true. All the information Tony supplies us with is obviously already within us. He is the ultimate coach in the area of human development. I can also tell you for a man with no education he has a Ph.D . How, you say. He has a Ph.D in results. He can turn the most limited minded person into what their true potential really is. He gets people from knowing what to do, to doing what they know. He is relentless in his pursuit. Anyone out there that does not understand him is obviously has some major disempowering associations. I do not work for Tony, though I would love to. Anyway, I found an affective strategy that I can utilize on a consitent basis in order to enhance the quality of my life.Tony is the ultimate mentor of success. It works.

The brisk pace and wide range covered in the book is constructive for anyone who wants to get serious about moving forward. After reading the book, I attended the seminar which I found to be very much the same materials covered in the text, but good none the less. The book is also available on tape and is an excellent for jogging or cycling.From Neuro-linguistic programming to what is popularly known as classical conditioning, Robbins quickly and succinctly instructs the reader on how to program themselves to self directed goals with written exercises for the reader and easy to read quotes and bullet points that waste as little time as possible.Excellent reading for adolescent and young adults in development."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have read the book several times.....AWESOME!!

Robbins has read extensively on human development and has rolled many worthwhile concepts into his book. He explores topics including belief systems, how to change, positive decision making, destroying blocks to success and more. This book gives a good overview of how to take better control of one's like.The reading is quick, but he could have been somewhat less verbose and get the same points across. Then again, it is a relatively minor point if this is what is needed to motivate people to take control of their lives.Although interesting, Robbin's book did not change me significantly. Almost all of his concepts can be found in other sources. However, Robbins work has helped many people a great deal...and it would be unwise to argue with this success!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Author and \\"life coach\\" Anthony Robbins takes on the gargantuan task of analyzing how the mind and body work, and how you can take control of every part of the process. He explains that all human actions and decisions originate in the pain-versus-pleasure principle. He then teaches you how to rewire your neurology so you associate pain with negative emotions and events, and replace it with the pleasure of the positive. Reading an Anthony Robbins book is like viewing a transcript of one of his self-empowerment seminars. The personal revelations, stories, anecdotes and analogies are fun to read, but the essential messages are buried beneath page after page of verbiage. Only the most patient and devoted Robbins follower will extract all the gems of wisdom from this lengthy treatise, but we think it is a worthwhile pursuit for the seeker who is willing to make this book a long-term companion."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Buy this book... its full of little gems of information5 stars no questions asked.

I like &quot;Awaken the Giant within&quot; for a number of reasons: 1) Concepts are clearly described 2) Assignments to apply the concepts take place immediate 3) Feed back on the results can be examined and quantified. The book is not a passive discussion of philosophy, but basic day to day paradims which apply directly, into your life. Here some of the valueable concepts I've learned: increase your net worth begins by increasing the value you offer daily. Increase the payout you provide increases your hourly wage. Second, change is a matter of focusing on pleasure and deterence from old behavior patterns is the result of pain. Third, creating 10 totally positive days. I haven't yet accomplished this assignment, but just three days or one day in a month is amazing. I will be happy to share other insights, but reading the book is really the key, to begin your self-improvement journey."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"All these power people pushing their own agendas has left little respect for others. These are the people who drive 95 miles an hour and run you off the road, the people who care about nothing but materialism, the people who are setup for shallow relationships and failed marriages. I don't want to meet power people, I want human beings who care about others, value something other than money and success, can deal with conflict in ways other than trouncing weaker people, who live by morals and ethics and respect others' boundaries, who think about something larger than themselves, and who build intimate lasting friendships instead of hollow feel-good encounters devoid of meaning."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have read everything Tony has come out with and everything is very practical.

There's no such thing as unlimited power, either. NLP is a pseudoscience. The YALE STUDY OF GOALS never existed, and firewalking is a scam!

But the last half the book is nothing but self brainwashing techniques that borders on practicing psychiatry without a license.

Robbins is all fluff, a Snake Oil Salesman and nothing more."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book, along with the entire body of Mr. Robbins products and services, is little more than grandiose promises of self actualization which will completely fail the individual who buys into them. Tony robbins is no different from the Church of Scientology, Landmark Education, or any of the other numerous vendors on the market who sell personal fulfillment at exorbitant prices. Make no mistake, the purpose of this book is to catch your attention so that you attend his seminars ad infinitum, which can be as expensive at $10,000 each.There is absolutely nothing of substance to be found in the \\"Giant Within\\", other than lies authored by a pimp who believes his own lies. Mr. Robbins' trademarked series of exercises, which he terms \\"neuroassociative conditioning,\\" are self hypnosis tactics of dubious validity. This is to say that they either do not work in any capacity at all, or that they will only exacerbate one's confusion and despair, leading to a further investment in Mr. Robbin's more expensive products and seiminars.There is no magic, quick fix solution to the tribulations of one's life situation. There is no single book or seminar which can lead to the rapid transformation of character. The most we as individuals can do is go deep within, find the sacred alter of our own spirit, and pray. This is what all of the great prophets throughout history have repeated time and time again. Perhaps we should listen to their sacred words before we give power crazed liars like Tony Robbins our money."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"It's funny how the reviews seem to be either gung-ho supportive or dripping with hostility.Let me be one to say this is a great book if you're looking for some help with *some* problems in your life. Yes, Anthony Robbins is largely a showman, and promises the world. Hopefully you're smart enough to realize you will not read this book and quit your retail job tomorrow and join NASA's astronaut program.But -- this book has many helpful parts. My personal favorite is his chapter on emotions. He categorizes and discusses all negative emotions (anger, frustration, etc.) and tells you how to use these emotions as tools to improve your life. I use this alot. Another fave of mine is his pattern \\"scrambling\\" technique for changing how you feel about very bad experiences you just can't seem to forget.Buy this book and try to make some positive changes in your life, but remember that it's not going to turn you into Mr./Mrs. Perfect. That part is up to you (maybe I should write my own book...). Good luck."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book is a mammoth task to get through and comprehend. If you're not prepared to put everything into action consistently you'll be disappointed. You'll get all excited because it is charsimatic and if you don't actually apply what you read you'll become disillusioned when your life hasn't changed. As for the losers saying he stole all this stuff from a whole bunch of others, get over it. The best thing about this book is that it means you don't have to read the seven hundred books this guy did to get to the heart of what all these mind guys said over the last 100 years. This is the only book I've read in this area so I can't really compare it to any other book but I have applied what he said and it has made a massive difference in my life. Personally I have no real desire to go to Mr Robbins seminars because I doubt there is much else to learn. I've checked out some of his other stuff at the bookstore and it seems to be a rehash of this. If you're wondering why he hasn't come out with anymore major works it's probably because he pulled out all the stops in this book. As far as his marriage break up goes, by the way he described some aspects of his relationship I was surprised it lasted that long. This is not a bible but it does have some fantastic ideas that if you put into action will bring changes to your life. Take what is useful to you, discard what is not, add it to everything else you have learned, then apply it to your life, persist in this way, and you will be ultimately successful."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Thanks to Tony and this book, I am now well on my way to finding the woman of my dreams at age 48, and finally achieving the career I want as a pro speculator in stocks and futures. And on top of it I am a life coach and personal trainer as well.If every junior high school child had to have a self improvement class that was mandatory to pass before going to the next higher grade, the entire world would be different. And if this book, could be a course unto itself at any high school, college or even junior high, it could change the world. People here who say this book is an infomercial or commercialized in any way are either \\"prove it to me\\" scientific types who need everything spelled out in a dry formula, or they must be completely unopen to new ideas. There is not one page of unecessary \\"fluff\\" as a few reviewers have claimed. Every word is a gem. One of the best books ever wriiten, period. And might even be the best self improvementt book of all time. People who claim NLP is better, tell me.....who do you know personally that claims they changed their life with it? I dont know any. I will take Awaken the Giant any day. Sure Anthony took some NLP and used it, but he made it more fun, easier to understand and much juicier. Nothing against Bandler and all those NLP guys, but they are so dry and hard to understand and they are the ones who want you to get \\"certified\\" for thousands of dollars in their methods. The one thing I would add to Anthony Robbins material is something author Brian Tracy said....\\"The key to success is to find the one thing you want more than anything else, and organize all of your activities around it.\\" That is the most amazing thing Ive ever heard, and I teach it to all my clients. Add that to Anthonys books and you have a complete package. I also recommend getting Tony's audio stuff, but since its sometimes expensive, get it used and listen to it in your car. This way if you read and also listen, your brain is impacted on 2 different levels! I also recommend starting a club or support group in your area to re-infoce and discuss the strategies. I wonder if anyone in south Florida would like to do that. If so, contact me at mince38 with a yahoo address.I would rate this book more truthful and accurate than the bible. One of the best things Tony says in the book is on page 390 where he says that when we are burdened with too many \\"shoulds\\" in life we dont want to play the game anymore. Man, who of us here hasnt started a new project and then got burned out from having too much on our plates? Tony is great. He shows us how to deal with overwhelm too. He talks about how we need to focus on our \\"musts\\" and eliminate the \\"shoulds.\\" Incredible. By the way I am a personal life coach like Tony and consider him one of my mentors,though I have never met him in person. Ive read the book at least 10 times since 1992 and am proud to say I am starting it all over again, today. Reinforcement! I would like to just add that I have been studying this book for 15 years. It just keeps getting better. For those of you who dont like Tonys materials, let me ask you a question- Could you imagine spending a day with Tony at your apartment just chatting and it \\"not\\" being really interesting? This guy is one of the most interesting people on the planet! 6 stars!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Imagine how much each of us can accomplish if only we believe in ourselves. Tony Robbins may be the only person I know who can blow the bugle and wake us up to realize the potential each of us has. Through helping us to get rid of our bad habits and behaviors, and set those goals we never thought we could reach, we can live happier, more fulfilling lives and contribute to humanity in ways we never dreamed possible. I love the expression &quot;flabby goals&quot; because it helps me visualize a half-inflated helium balloon with the word &quot;goals&quot; written on it. Who wants to have goals that can't quite reach for the sky?There is a new book out that offers this motivation and road map to organizations of all kinds, &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution,&quot; by Donald Mitchell, Carol Coles and Robert Metz. The book teaches that it is easier to achieve 20 times the normal rate of progress or get there 20 time faster, and it is less expensive! To begin, it helps you identify why you are &quot;stalled&quot;. These &quot;stalls&quot; are caused by poor Communications (the message is not understood), Disbelief (We can't do it), Tradition (We've always done it this way), Bureaucracy (too many unproductive policies and procedures), Misconception (based on poor assumptions), Unattractiveness (Not wanting to wade in murky waters) and Procrastination (We can do it tomorrow, and maybe it will get better before then). Then, using questions to develop new information, and as Tony Robbins does so brilliantly, changes the way decisions are made and, in effect, changes corporate behavior, we succeed mightily. Read and reread these books and you will achieve what you never dreamed possible.These books encourage us to set our stretch goals and go after them. I have been inspired to each by these books, and I know you will be too."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"The material is very disorganized and he constantly jumps from one topic to another within sections. He talks about himself way too much. And I don't think he goes in depth enough in the topics. Like for example the first chapter is about making decisions. He says that decisions can change your life in an instant and gives examples of people who have made important decisions and concludes that decisions can change your life. He gives no strategy for improving your decision-making skills besides \\"make more decisions\\". He does seem to have a lot of energy, which can be motivational. I'm going to guess that the motivational component is what is getting his high ratings, but I don't think the strategies he gives are very good."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"After reading &quot;Unlimited Power&quot;, I was eagerly expecting this book. It wasn't what I expected. I originally read this book 2 years ago. Since then, I've read it 2 more times. The book is dated with references to OJ, Micheal Jackson, to name a few. Each have fell off the deep end. (OJ trial, Jackson's behavior) The book is also overwritten in my opinion. He's constantly asking questions every other sentence. (I got the feeling I was being cross-examined.) The author uses a conversional language as if the book was being dictated on a recorder for later type up. This at times leads to rambling about everything from his family members, friends, the play Les Mis&eacute;rables, his trip to Figi, his company, Mr.Smith, his visit to a morgue. It reminds me of being stuck on the phone with a friend for 3 hours straight listening to every bit of gossip and trivia. The last reason I give it 3 stars - he starts being too preachy around page 300 on; from taking up causes to eating less beef. On the plus side, there are some useful bits - from identifying the values that are important to you to making the right decisions and breaking habits. At 511 pages, the book is more like a handbook than a book that should be read outright. The finacial part of the book came near the end of the book and covers only one chapter with 5 keys to wealth. One key I disagree with partly as being outdated. Creating wealth by being more valuable to your company for example doing 3 times more work or adding value to your work is ok if you're self-employed, but as an employee I found that for you to become more wealthy you need to have fair mind employers to recognize your creative efforts and give you those raises to increase your income. I've found many employers simply pocketing the savings their employees come up with and not even acknowledge their efforts to avoid giving raises. This is mainly true in low end jobs like fast foods. Down-sizing has made this key advise mandatory just to KEEP your job. The author needs to update this book and reduce the number of stories and personal accounts in the next edition. To start out, I would recommend &quot;Unlimited Power&quot; instead and only &quot;Awaken the Giant&quot; as a supplement reference manual to &quot;Unlimitd Power&quot;."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I read some of the reviews below (notably the ones from France and Germany Sept 13th) and it became clear to me that such reviewers really should try to see the positive in things. I think any one of Robbins' books is worth over a million bucks each!I'm an Emergency Physician and I have read Kant, Descartes, much Shakespeare and numerous vessels of 'profound knowledge' or whatever you prefer to call it. Every book has a use. There is something to learn (or be amused with) in everything we come across: book or person!Tony Robbins yes is a millionaire and a successful person: I could not take his stuff seriously if he wasn't! He practises what he preaches - that much is very obvious.He's ethical and claims to be nothing more than 'just another human being'. He could have been unethical many times and made some kind of crazy cult out of this. He could have had a long line of misled devotees at his door with religious offerings to Swami Robbins every morning - but did he hell?!If people don't see the value in his advice then I would advise they try again and not suspect or be cynical of everything you see. Its true the Americans especially are prone to believe anything they see (in truth they are the most open-minded of nations) but this guy is no idiot. He has a formula which he says is NOT the only method but is ONE method.Give him a chance or go and pity yourself some more and then, when you're done, give yourself a chance!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"It's amazing to me how many people in society think that psychologists and psychiatrists are the &quot;know all&quot; of the human mind. It's the same with medicine (especially in medicine). Do the research...you'd be amazed on what you'd find. (especially on how much money doctors make pharmaceutical companies a year..and how about those kickbacks!)Why is it that much of society is dogmatic? Raised on beliefs of their parents (handed down from their parents and so on) and the &quot;norms&quot; of society shaped very much by the media. Society as a whole fails to think for themselves. Ask someone why they believe what they believe and most can't give you any logic behind it. That's sad. Robbins teaches us to break our negative belief patterns by challenging your beliefs. Why do you believe what you believe?Robbins offers logical principles much of what is taken from NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). I've been a fan of his ideaology since 1990. Have an open mind and stop giving into the dogmatic views of the western culture."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have quite a library of books and tapes from people like Napolean Hill to Anthony Robbins. Many years ago, somebody gave me a book on NLP, I have yet to finish it. It was not easy reading.Conversely, Robbins is as enjoyable to read as he is to listen to. He offers basic NLP techniques (he calls it NAC) and I agree with Tony that the key for long lasting results is to practice these techniques, to condition your mind with neuro associative techniques.Perhaps the best key is to model other successful people. This can speed your success rate. The goal setting workshop is powerful.Awaken The Giant is an outstanding book that can help you reach your dreams."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"While their ar many self help books on the market, Tony Robbins excellent work, &quot;Awaken the Giant&quot; is perhaps the very best to help you get results--quickly.I am dismayed at the negative reviews. Perhaps these reviewers don't want to change.I also highly recommend &quot;The Magic of Thinking Big&quot; by Dr. David Schwartz and &quot;Direct from Dell&quot; by Michael Dell.Direct from Dell is excellent for anyone who is in business and is very motivational.Tony Robbins teaches to find mentors and models. If your goal is to be successfulin business, who better to model than the 9th richest man in the world-Michael Dell!And by the way, Tony why not interview Michael Dell for a future Power Talk program?"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book is well worth the money. It has more detail than some of his audiotape programs. For $11.20 he includes complete information from several of his seminars combined. As far as I'm concerned that is a total bargain. I paid $700 for a weekend video seminar of his and the information in &quot;Awaken the Giant Within,&quot; covered it all and even more on top of that.Some of the reviewers have left some negative comments about Tony Robbins that I believe to be inaccurate. I'd like to address those. The October 7, 2000 review from Abilene, TX stated some things which are incorrect. The reviewer said that very little information is credited to researchers. That is simply not accurate. All throughout the book he gives credit to numerous authors or people on all different areas. Then the reviewer goes on to say that NAC is basically ripped off from NLP. (I am a Certified Practitioner of NLP.) Throughout his book he mentions NLP so he wasn't trying to hide his association with the NLP concepts. NAC is not just another version of NLP. It is quite distinct from NLP. NAC is a bunch of psychological technologies put together. Even NLP was mostly borrowed from a couple of other Psychologists. It took Tony Robbins to make NLP famous. He made NLP more famous than its founders ever did. That in itself could say something about Tony Robbins abilities to market and certainly his ability to succeed.The reason so many people know about him is because of some of the Self-Improvement technologies he either developed or at least used. I've read over 200 books on personal development and I've found there is much repetition in these books. Being original is not the key issue. The key is whether you get results. The ideas for his infomercials came from one of his technologies called Questions are the Answer. At the time his company was in debt to the tune of around $700,000 and against all the advise of his advisors he found a way to turn his company around and make it very profitable. That's another great story of his principles in action. Questions are the Answer is not Tony's creation for that is basically the way anyone becomes creative; by asking the right question. But the way he put the information together was really useful to me. It showed me that there is always a possibility to make an improvement in my life by simply changing how I focus on a situation by changing the questions I ask myself. This technique has become a lifestyle for me. I'm always looking for better questions to make breakthroughs in my life.Another technique I really like is Nuero Associative Conditioning or NAC for short. It helped me realize that in the main thing I needed to change myself was strong enough desire or Leverage as he calls it. But better than that, he showed me how to create that desire at any time. That is the great part about that technique for me. (Though there is much more to it.) I've used Leverage with several habits that I wanted to change and I was successful at changing them when before nothing was getting done about these problems.To some up, this is like many books in one. I recommend reading many other motivational books. Tony Robbins is not the only worthwhile motivational author, but he is a good one. I also recommend reading &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People,&quot; by Dale Carnegie, &quot;Maximum Achievement,&quot; by Brian Tracy, &quot;Your Infinite Power to Be Rich,&quot; by Joseph Murphy, and &quot;How to Be Twice as Smart,&quot; by Scott Witt. Anyone who thinks his stuff is all hype either doesn't know much about self-improvement or dislikes Tony for some reason. Tony has made his mistakes but you won't be making a mistake by getting this book.(Note I do not work for Tony Robbins, I just think it is funny how some people have a negative reaction to him with all the things he has achieved. I've found that many people have a built in bias towards someone who is good at marketing himself or herself. They dislike people who in anyway promote their other materials in their books. Is there something wrong about helping people have more ways to improve themselves? Is there something wrong with a guy like Tony Robbins making money? I think many people are just jealous and that is why they criticize him.)"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken The Giant Within is one of the most powerful books I've ever read. In December 1994, after winning a battle with cancer, I stood, nearly bald, in the audience of my first motivational seminar, conducted by Anthony Robbins.Shortly after the seminar I read Awaken The Giant Within to learn more about taking charge of my destiny. To this day, I refer to this book often for inspiration and guidance.Over the years, I've read and listened to lots of self-help material in my quest to discover the secret to success. Without question, this book provides the clearest and most incredibly inspiring ideas. Since reading this book, I've greatly increased my level of health (by becoming vegetarian), doubled my income, and formed my own consulting company.Awaken The Giant Within consists of four sections:Part One: Unleash your powerPart Two: Taking Control - The Master SystemPart Three: The Seven Days to Shape Your LifePart Four: A Lesson in DestinyAlthough the book is quite long, it is a very exciting read. Starting off with \\"Dreams of Destiny\\" Robbins tells a story of how his life changed as a result of the principles he learned. He states \\"We all have dreams ... We all want to believe deep down in our souls that we have a special gift, that we can make a difference ...\\" Moving on, he explains, step-by-step, how to go about articulating what it is you want, the forces that shape our destiny, and how to harness the power within to create our own destiny.In summary, what I enjoy most about Awaken The Giant Within, and all of Anthony Robbins' other works, is that he challenges you to test his ideas for yourself, instead of accepting ideas on blind faith. Also, I must clarify that Awaken The Giant Within (or any other book for that matter) WILL NOT magically make you successful. It requires YOU to work with the material, develop strategies, and most importantly - take action.Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Wow. Lots of discussion and information in the other reviews, but I am kind of concerned with the naysayers. It seems everyone forgets it is just a book. It doesn't claim to be the Bible, or a great literary work. It is just a book. And as such, it is a tool (or in this case, a collection of tools). It offers you the author's viewpoint and his collected wisdom. With this in mind i think Tony does an incredible job with this book.Sure it is repetitive with his other works. Sure most of the ideas are neither his nor are they new, but to quote Tony &quot;if reading or hearing something one more time, or in a different way, gets you to apply it, than it's worth it.&quot; One thing which I feel AtGW does well is put those concepts and techniques which we may not pay attention to into &quot;simple speak&quot; and present it in a way that people can understand and relate. That is the goal of a good book. And in that regard i feel it is successful.Sure parts of it are corny, but if being corny helps you to remember what you learn, isn't it a successr? I know personally i had heard much of the same concepts in college Psych classes but they were never presented to me in ways that made them pop into my mind during normal day-to-day interactions. Tony's enthusiastic and quirky presentation helps you understand and apply. I see many people compare it to the works of Mr. Covey. In my opinion - having taken Covey course twice and having read his books - Covey offers a great deal of information. And maybe more powerful tools. But they are dry in presentation and not easily absorbed. AtGW, as well as Tony's other programs and books, offers its material in a way that is fun to read and educational.We all follow some philosophy for how we live our lives. AtGW helps you understand what yours is and helps you understand how to change what you don't like. It offers a number of tools, techniques, annecdotes, and viewpoints for changing your beliefs and preconceived notions. Some of these may be right for you, some may not. YOU have to decide what does and apply it to make the magic happen.Like Tony says, &quot;We all need a coach.&quot; Coaches in sports don't necessarily give us new skills or talent. What coaches can do is help us understand how to use the abilities we have, and what AtGW is do that for your personal development skills. I read that he is overly enthusiastic and self-promoting. Now if you were to pick a coach for any other aspect of your life would you want someone excited, passionate and confident or someone dispassionate and reserved. Part of Tony's success is that he comes across so passionate about what he is teaching that the excitement rubs off.It is interesting that a lot of the negative comments center around the changes not lasting forever. They shouldn't. Order and direction require work. They require constant attention. Tony states that we have to continually condition ourselves or like a piano we lose our &quot;tuning&quot;.So read the book. If you get one technique you can use, or one different way to look at yourself, for the rest of your life it will be worth the &lt;$20 you shell out."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book will appeal mostly to the the infantile/gullible. I have spoken with at least a dozen people who bought this book and Robbins persona power program--No noticeable improvement.One guy was a janitor ten years ago making $7.50 a hour.

I must admit I had some scepticism of Mr Robbins based on his infomercials, mainly because he tells what his material can do, but not how it works. In this book though he delivers the goods.This book contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. I am still working through this book, yet already I have successfully used some of the concepts.For example, there is a chapter about asking yourself the right questions, which can instantly change you into a more positive and empowering state, rather than feel victimized as people often do by adversity.I used the transformative language technique to resolve a situation where I was angered by the behavior of an associate. Through using the word disenchanted instead of angry to describe how I felt, I immediately lessened the emotional intensity of the situation, and was ultimately able to resolve the situation peacefully.This book also contains practical and powerful NLP techniques, such as repatterning and swish technique. While it may be true to say that some of Robbins work is derivative of the works of Erickson, Bandler and Grinder I have rarely seen the material presented in such a user friendly way. There truly is magic in these concepts.If you can imagine leading a better and more effective life the concepts in this book will show you the way.What I particularly appreciate about this book is how well written it is. It has a really flowing easy to read style. I highly recommend this book, and I have a great deal of respect for the writer after reading it.I hope you find this review helpful."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I first read this book a few years ago when I was jobless and feeling only despair . The overriding feeling and message I got from the book was that your past was not equal to your future. It gave me new inspiration to continue and more importantly it gave me some much needed advice on how to deal with rejection when it inevitably comes along. Mr Robbins is a great motivator and I expecially like that fact that he rarely embellishes his work with any religious hocus-pocus . He makes you believe that it is in your own power to make changes and I now believe that everybody is responsible for their own happiness and destiny .Before i always used yo blame others for my problems. Perhaps the book does mirror what others say bit the book is so well-written that you always feel better having read a few pages of it . Although i first read this book 3 years ago I still keep my dog-eared copy of it . It's like a personal handbook that I refer to again and again whenever I need some inspiration . This is the highest recommendation I can give it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts.Anthony Robbins summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) to create quick change. He also presents a tool called Neuro Associative Conditioning (NAC). This technique assists you to condition yourself for success. Robbins applies them in a very practical and useful manner.\\"Awaken The Giant\\" is a fantastic book with powerful strategies for those who are perceptive enough to use them. This book will improve your entire life from reaching goals to rapport with others. You can change your limiting beliefs and achieve goals that you thought were out of reach. You can greatly improve your interpersonal relationships. You can be better than your best. You can learn to quit bad habits like smoking or alcoholism or solve your overweight problem. You can overcome fears and phobias.The material is presented in reader friendly way. The material is well organised and flows smoothly throughout and is easy to read and follow.Don't be intimidated by the length of the book as it is very interesting and exciting to read. Robbins gives some very insightful anecdotes that illustrate the practical application of his principles and methods that really work. He methodically, step-by-step, explains how to go about articulating what it is you want, the forces that shape our destiny, and how to harness the power within to create our own destiny.This is recommended reading for those who want to change for the better and are prepared to back up their desire with action."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Great book! I see some negatives reviews, but my opinion is that those who critize have not used Tony's techniques. I feel this and other Tony's materials are invaluable!. When I read Tony for the first time in 1991, I was broke, I barely spoke English, but when I started studying his material, suddenly my confidence grew! I started applying his techniques in everything, relationships, my spiritual life, I went in business for myself, etc. In other words, my life changed! After 9 years, I have been featured in a couple of magazines, I am respected in my field, I have spoke in front of thousands (Great for somebody like me who did not speak much English before) I earn a six figure income, I have a great family, great peace within me. now, I want to clarify that his material DOES NOT WORK by itself, YOU ARE THE ONE who has to work with his material. Now I also, read, listen, study and use the ideas from other great thinkers like Denis Waitley, Bob Proctor, Brian Tracy, etc, but the one who inspired me to start finding my potential again was Tony Robbins! The others have been also great addition in helping me to be a better person.If you don't like his material, it is ok, but it maybe the missing link in your life.truthforum@aol.com"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Recently I'd been having some problems applying for jobs. Every day I'd commit to applying and every day would come around and I'd find some excuse not to do it. In fact, I couldn't even get myself to take action and search websites or read want ads. I wouldn't even let job hunting enter my consciousness.Realizing I had a problem, I first read Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy, by David Burns. This book seemed promising and according to the author was the #1 most recommended book on a list of 1,000 self-help titles. (I learned this in the follow-up: The Feeling Good Handbook.) Yet, every day I found excuses to avoid applying for jobs. It just seemed too painful to me to go apply for jobs I didn't want in the first place and then to get mercilessly rejected.Feeling Good and Awaken the Giant Within approach the issue of self-esteem from exactly opposite positions. Feeling Good says that you should have self-esteem no matter how little you've achieved in life. Awaken the Giant Within admits that most of us base our self-esteem on how we're perceived by others, or at least, how we think we'll be perceived by others.All I can say is the approach in Feeling Good didn't work for me.But in Chapter 3 of Awaken the Giant Within Mr. Robbins discusses the forces of pain and pleasure, and shows that everything we do is a result of our trying to avoid pain and move toward pleasure. He says that most people don't achieve what they want in life because they focus on the short-term pain, rather than the long term pleasure. And I realized that this was exactly what I was doing. I was avoiding job hunting and applying for jobs because of the pain I imagined I'd receive from being rejected. Of course, by avoiding taking action, a larger pain would be waiting for me down the road: homelessness.With a single concept, Awaken the Giant Within got me to take action, which the entire book of Feeling Good could not do.A second concept that is going to change my life is in Chapter 4: \\"Belief Systems: The Power to Create and the Power to Destroy.\\" The main concept in this chapter is that what you believe is irrelevant as far as its accuracy goes. (Not counting dangerous beliefs like I can heal my children with my thoughts, or I can fly if I jump off this building, of course.) What counts is whether the belief is motivating for you or not, whether the belief gets you to take positive action.For example, let's pretend I'm a wannabe writer. But I'm a little conflicted about my talents. I have doubts about whether I'll ever make it or not. Sometimes I feel like the stuff I write is great and sometimes I believe I'll never succeed. So what happens when I waffle like this is that I go for long periods without writing at all. Thus, slowing the process down incredibly, taking years to complete a single novel.But what if I changed my beliefs to: \\"This book is going to be a bestseller. As soon as I complete this book, my life is going to change dramatically. As soon as I complete this book, all my dreams are going to come true.\\"Of course, the odds are that it won't be a bestseller. There's a good chance it won't even sell.But, by having this positive belief, I take action. I complete the book and at a decent pace. And it either sells or it doesn't, but the belief did what it was supposed to do, it got me to take consistent, daily action. And if that book doesn't sell, then I have the same belief for the next one: \\"As soon as I complete this book, my life is going to change dramatically. I can't wait to get this book written. I can't wait to get famous, etc. My life is going to be incredible.\\" (Of course, keep your beliefs to yourself. Your friends will be very eager to pop your balloon. But when you keep writing books and they don't know why you're suddenly being so productive, they'll be eating their hearts out! )Basically you want to believe whatever keeps you most motivated, whatever gets you to take action. Because in reality your success is determined by your consistent, daily actions."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken the Giant within is one of Tony's most empowering books.

I'm sure we all have seen his late night commercials on TV at 2am in the morning. As someone who always would laugh at the commercials I was always intrigued with them at the same time and always found myself watching them til they were over. Well flash forward a few years and in desperate need of a \\"LIFE\\" change I came across this book by Anthony Robbins.It is a book that I highly recommend. Not only is it filled with commen sense ideas but also is filled with examples of other peoples problems that they overcame. It motivated me to change my negative thinking and behaviors and start to live a more positive life. What Tony made me understand is that obstacles are not brick walls but small challenges that we can over come. Positive thinking is more than just thinking positive but \\"Living\\" positive.I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a little motivation to change their life for the better. Even if you don't need this push in your life it's still a great read that gives you quite a lot of advice and hints that you can use in your life from the first page that you read.

Some of the criticism directed toward it seems to come from folks who've inferred from the marketing hype that all someone needs to do to make a huge leap in the quality of their life is buy this book. Some of Tony's marketing may well imply that, but nowhere in the book itself does Tony. His content is that one is always learning and studying. As for Tony's over the top lowest common denominator marketing efforts, if you're not in the target niche and find it a bit much, better to overlook it and avoid throwing the trophy girlfriend out with the jacuzzi water.I've bought 5 copies over the past 2 yrs, 3 to give to people, and a 2nd copy to replace my well worn first copy. To repeat, I've given it to 3 people, not 30, because like any tool it is more suited to some jobs than others. It is NOT magic dust, there is no $12 magic dust or even 12k magic dust.One of Tony's old infomercials featured a former busboy who used Tony's book to help him advance to owning a restaurant, and many folk seemed to take that as meaning all the dude did was put down his tray and pick up Tony's book. If you order the book expecting that, forget it. But, if you're employed below your ability, can't seem to get your assorted skills under a tent and apply them, or you can't motivate yourself to acquire the skills and knowledge you need to move ahead, this book can help you live more productively and cover the ground between where you are and where you want to be.I first read Tony's book when I was in the early stages of opening my own business. I've established it and exceeded my quartly growth projections for 4 of 6 quarters. I've applied concepts from the book along the way and I doubt I would have done as well w/o them. I also had 10+ yrs of experience and a grad degree. Much of that was also indispensable. This book helped me max the benefit from all of that, helped me put the pieces together.For $12 you can't beat what you get. Tony's book has convinced me that accomplishment is simple: \\"What do you need to do to get to where you want to be? Now that you know, go do it.\\" It's only hard if you allow it to be hard. All you gotta do is tell yourself 'I will' and 'I can' instead of 'I wont' and I can't'. Many people (sadly) have deep seated reasons for not wanting to move forward, and if you're certain you're one of them, save your money. Otherwise I don't know any reason not to gamble the $12 on the premise that something Tony says will help you.Lastly, as for those who claim the book is just a sales pitch for the seminars; I've always viewed it the other way around. The book holds Tony's message, the seminars are his way of reaching folks who aren't into reading."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Hi, I just wanted to say out of the 70 or so books on success that I have read, this one is the most cogent and powerful one I have ever read. I read his first book about 10 years ago and did not get any results until recently. Why? I thought Anthony Robbins was full of bull, full of himself and was just in it to make money. To make a long story short, I finally decided to APPLY his principles and take action. I now work for an e-commerce site, have started my own net company that empowers others, but most importantly I am more fulfilled than I have ever been. Success just doesn't leave clues, it screams them out at you. People just do not listen and habitually ask disempowering questions such as: Why don't I have more money? Why don't I win the lottery? Why am I lonely? This book is worth 100s more than what I paid for it because it makes you realize what really drives human behavior and how to make PERMANENT changes. Yes, Tony Robbins is sort of a cheesy fella, but take a chance, you have nothing to lose. At the end of your life you will ask yourself, &quot;Did I live life as an adventure?&quot; Make sure you know the answer to that ahead of time. Best Wishes to you all."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have a library of 300-400 cassettes and at least as many books, most dealing with motivation and personal development and nobody speaks with the power of ROBBINS.

It was just like other books and tapes that get you all reved up and then you say &quot;wow, what was that all about&quot; and your back where you started from. I got mre benefit from NLP-The New Science of Achievement by NLP Comphrehensive than from all of ROBBINS material. I also strogly recommend the old but timeless classc &quot;Think &amp; Grow Rich&quot; by Naploean Hill and &quot;Business Buy the Bible&quot; by WADE COOK."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"In general, people seem to have extreme reactions to Tony Robbins. This idea appears to be supported by the variations in the reviews of Awaken the Giant Within. Love him or hate him, he is arguably one of the greatest motivational speakers of all time. In line with that level of excellence, I believe this book has earned its place among the top self-help books ever written.Like any other self-help book, whether you find this book useful or not depends on what you are looking for. One important thing to consider before buying/reading this book is whether you want to use it to improve your life or to help someone else. While the material can be used for both, it is primarily focused on creating change within yourself.Compared to his first book, Unlimited Power, which focused heavily on Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) as developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, Awaken the Giant Within presents a similar method of creating change which he calls Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC).The difference between the two approaches, however subtle, is powerfully important. As he says in the book, the term \\"programming\\" has an implication that once you've done an NLP pattern, such as a \\"swish\\" pattern (described in Unlimited Power), then it is logical to conclude that the change is programmed in permanently. Instead, he focuses on the importance of conditioning and reinforcing change. Just as one trip to the gym is unlikely to create a lifetime of physical fitness, creating and maintaining change requires consistent reinforcement and conditioning.In essence, NAC and the material presented in this book are NLP for the masses. If you are interested in studying the more technical aspects of NLP, Bandler and Grinder's books would be a great place to start, beginning withFrogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming. Books by other authors such asMagic of NLP Demystified: A Pragmatic Guide to Communication & Change (Positive Change Guides)andNLP: The New Technology of Achievementprovide a more comprehensive and systematic overview of basic NLP techniques.Awaken the Giant Within is filled with inspirational stories combined with specific systems and strategies designed to create change. As Tony often says, knowledge is only potential power and only becomes power if you put it into action. If you decide to read this \\"seminar in a book,\\" remember that it's the application of the information that creates the change."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken the Giant Within: I have read more than 200 books on self-development. Everything from positive thinking to self-talk. When I read ATGW, I felt that all of them were a mere preface, an introduction to this book. Its that good. Anthony Robbins writes with a sensitivity which touches your heart. And his techniques are extremely effective. This is a really good book. Encouraging, motivating and most important of all providing you with tools, real tools - which can and will make a difference.I know a friend who was going through a very very tough time in his life, when he found ATGW. It gave him the strength to stand uup and face the circumstances of his life.Unlimited Power: Another book by Anthony Robbins, it was written before ATGW. Unlimited Power is a better book than ATGW. But ATGW is a better written book. Unlimited Power contains an amazing quantity of techniques, each of them as important and as interesting as the other. As he rightly mentions in his book - Each of his chapters could be a book in themselves. But his mission was to write an exhaustive manual on instantly effective techniques of self-improvement. And he has succeeded!! In this book he presents the techniques of NLP which was created by Bandler and Grinder. NLP stands for Nuero Linguistic Programming. Let the name not scare you. It's a wonderful tool which promises and delivers instant results. Buy this book, read it. But if you want to gain the maximum out of this book, use it as a manual, a workbook. Something to which you return again and again.By the way, Check out the credentials of Tony Robbins, now that we have talked about his book. A janitor, Tony transformed his life in one and a half years, becoming a millionaire at the age of 24. Now, he lives in a castle and owns an island. Here is one guy who has really created the life of his dreams. Today he has trained everybody from Princess Diana to Bill Clinton to Andre Aggassi. Often called the world's best speaker, Tony's programs have received huge media coverage - during his 3 day seminars in USA, the participants walk on fire to find out what it is that they are actually capable of. Tony, called \\"One of the greatest influencers of our generation\\" by Steven Covey own Anthony Robbins Foundation, the holding company for 9 AR Group of companies."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"No, I'm not talking about &quot;Belief Systems.&quot; Of course I could use &quot;Transformational Vocabulary&quot; and call this book &quot;a little aromatic.&quot;The tone of this book contains a lot of energy and inspiration but the content is another story. It sensationalizes and dramatizes many issues (just count how many exclamation points appear and how many times the word &quot;power&quot; comes up). Do we really have to become &quot;Giants&quot; to be happy?This book alleges to teach you &quot;How to take immediate control of your mental, emotional, physical, and financial destiny!&quot; I found it disturbing that he includes &quot;fianancial&quot; as a fifth dimension of man. Dr. Stephen Covey, in &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;, more expertly describes man's quality of life depending upon the first four. He instructs us that each dimension &quot;interdependently&quot; affects the other and the key to improving one is to improve the others. For example, exercising (physical) can give us more energy to read(mental). This book explains neither connection nor natural sequence between each of the human dimensions. The 7 Habits depicts them in order: physical, mental, social (or emotional), and spiritual, telling us that each one contains and depends upon the others before it. This book totally neglects the spiritual dimension and seems to have replaced it with this &quot;financial&quot; dimension. While Covey includes &quot;financial&quot; into the &quot;physical&quot; section, Robbins makes it into a fifth dimension, over-emphasizing the importance of money.While Robbins includes a brief section on analyzing our time spent into &quot;important&quot; and &quot;urgent&quot; categories telling us to spend time on the important, Covey again is more intricate and accurate. He uses a time quadrant, including urgent but not important , urgent and important , neither important nor urgent, and important but not urgent (the most desirable quad to spend time in.)A section of Robbins' book carries the title, &quot;The Ultimate Challenge: What One Person Can Do.&quot; But Covey teaches us that we can achieve far more together than each of us could independently. This he calls &quot;interdependence,&quot; something Robbins neglects in this book.While Robbins' based his book upon techniques that may or may not work depending upon the situation, Covey based his book on principles that never change. Awaken the Giant teaches us outside-in strategies like &quot;Transformational Vocabulary&quot; to change our attitude or behavior. The 7 Habits teaches us inside-out strategies like changing our marriage by first changing ourselves or changing our behaviors by first changing what our behaviors flow from- our perceptions. Robbins based his book on the assumption that you already know what you want (money, sex, power, more money, good looks) Covey bases his book on the idea that we can only be effective climbing the ladder of success if it is leaned against the right wall. While Robbins' book shows us how to use our moods to achieve, Covey's teaches us Proactivity: using the space between stimulus and response to act based upon values, not moods.Covey wrote another book just on the success stories of the 7 Habits along with further instruction: &quot;Living the Seven Habits&quot;. To date, Robbins has published no &quot;Living Awaken the Giant Within&quot; and no wonder.You may even want to bypass the self-help books altogether and take another route: If you want to make more money, read a Financial Strategy book. If you want to get into better shape, read a Fitness book. If you want to pursue the &quot;Ultimate Solution&quot; to homelessness, the prison system, or gang violence, read a Sociology book. This book displays no expertise on any of these subjects, although it professes to."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"When Tony Robbins was recommended by a friend, I began to wonder what makes this self help guru so attractive to otherwise normal-seeming people?As a practical person, my main questions while ploughing through the entirety of this 500 page book were 1) where is the utility? and 2) where is the innovation? In other words, what realistic actionable program does Tony offer that one hasn't likely acquired through common sense, an elementary school education and some life expereince? Aside from rehashing the obvious (e.g. list your goals, strive for excellence, think positive etc.) I found no answers.Sure, I know what its like to feel weak and in need of help & answers. So when you're in this condition, and Tony promises help and answers, his products look attractive. You buy his book listen to his CD, he gets you worked up into a burst of enthusiasm. Great!Then later, when you calmly contemplate what Robbins has said, you can't really recall anything but the essence because what really happened is he took a simple, familiar concept like \\"think positive\\" and fluffed it out into a chapter slickly titled \\"The Science of Neuro-Associative Conditioning\\" or spun it as a lame buzzword like \\"destiny technologies.\\" Ohhhhh, brudda!Tony Robbins uses words to stimulate your brain into thinking you've made real discoveries and real progress towards your goal. When in reality, you've accomplished nothing at all. Its like snorting coke, but he gives you words instead of narcotics, the effect is similar, the experience is illusory, temporary.To all Tony Robbins fans, I mean no offense, but his works do not withstand critical reasoning. Its so easy to say the teaching is useful when you produce no measurable evidence. I've yet to see any reliable evidence to indicate that his books, tapes and rallies work better than doing something else, or doing nothing.The friend who recommended this book has a goal to make financial improvements to his life and says Tony has \\"helped\\" him. When I inquired about the mechanics of how the Tony program for unleashing his inner giant is going to work, he can't articulate a plan. The best he can do is give me a sarcastic brush off. He's no better off now than years ago before he started the Tony program.Certainly, cold science says Tony's ideas about the \\"Q-links\\" he promotes during his expensive seminars, and dietary \\"megahertz\\" (?!) are completely bogus and call his sincerity and ethics into question.Of course, when you leave the realm of measurable, you leave the realm of science and reality, and enter into \\"faith\\" and religion. Therefore, its clear to me that Tony offers here is a type of pseudo-religion, a self-centered spirituality souped up for the modern world. This book is religion-lite for insecure athiests, new-age types and other assorted suckers in need of a crutch. His following is no different than a cult following. They have \\"faith\\" but its not resting on a solid foundation.But given the vast numbers of people who turn to Tony for help, statistically, there will be somebody who benefits greatly from it but probably not you. Bottom line, Tony Robbins barely passes as entertainment fluff. Save your money and buy some Charlie Brown comics."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Junk!

Even though his first book 'Awaken the Giant Within' was published more than a decade ago, it still holds immense relevance in today's world. This is a book packed with plenty of strategies on how to take charge of your emotions, health, relationships and finances. It is a holistic book that offers timeless philosophies that can help you reach your true goals and discover your passion in life.I have read several self-help books and while most were helpful, I find 'Awaken the Giant Within' a very well thought-out book. Self-help books tend to lean too much on the advice, but offer little in the way of execution. This book seems to be more of a practical, strategic guide than a book of superficial hope, which is a good thing. I would completely recommend it to anyone looking to bypass the fluff, hype or superficial positive thinking literature for a more substantial read.I would recommend to read it a couple of times in order to understand and implement the underlying philosophies. Robbins' literature is heavily influenced by Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP), which might at times be a bit complex to get the hang of."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This is one of the best and most motivational books ever written on how to become successful (your idea of successful), how to achieve everything you ever wanted and how live a happy and fullfilling life.

His study of the science of Neuro-Linguistic Programming(NLP) which he personally now calls Neuro-Associative Conditioning(NAC), personal and organizational Success and Health philosophies and principles led him to become a famous psychotherapist, motivational speaker, and consultant to royal families, presidents, famous sports teams, fortune 500 companies and famous personalities and audiences all over the world. This a definitely a book everyone should own. It is easy to be a skeptic if you have no idea why the book was written the way it was. Less than 20 dollars to change your entire life for the better??

The interchapter quotes are really thought provoking, as well."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Master motivator, Anthony Robbins brings back to life what lies dormant in most human beings -- the power of self. Not at all a &quot;get rich quick&quot; scheme, Robbin's work instructs the reader on how to effectively manipulate and utilize one's natural talents. By following the steps outlined by Robbins, the reader is empowered to increase the quality and enjoyment of his or her life. Tony Robbins most basic premise is, &quot;In our moments of decision, we begin to shape our destiny.&quot; Simply, a person can change his or her life's course by making a decision and sticking to it. This process is easier said than done, but Robbins offers real-life solutions on how to accomplish the task. Stressing goal-setting, Robbins asserts that an individual will be able to maximimize his or her potential by making a decision, setting goals and then taking action. Most human beings have great goals in mind, but do not take the necessary steps to achieving these goals. Without taking the proper course of action, one never realizes one's goals. Simply wishing for the fulfillment of goals without action, according to Robbins, is simply &quot;A weak prayer.&quot; He writes,&quot;True decisions are the catalyst for turning our dreams into reality...(One must)proclaim, This is who I am. This is what my life is about. And this is what I'm going to do. Nothing will stop me from achieving my destiny, I will not denied!&quot; Once an individual makes a decision, he or she has created a belief. Robbins states that &quot;Behind all successful people lies a specific set of empowering beliefs.&quot; The next step is putting the beliefs into action. By doing so, writes Robbins, &quot;(One must) rehearse (the beliefs and methods of attaining the goal) again and again until a neurological way is created...Your brain will begin to associate this as a new way of producing this result on a consistent basis.&quot; Robbins insists that if people envision acheiving their goals, they will go into a state where they feel like they could make it happen. By positive projection, one can easily reach his or her goals which he or she had before felt was unattainable. What give Robbins' assertions credibility is that he insists individuals must set realistic goals. He does not assert that everything is possible; he insists instead that most things are possible. Tony Robbins simply teaches the reader how to overcome negative &quot;road blocks&quot; that prevents one from acheiving what one most desires -- whether it is seeking a better career, publishing a book, or becoming a kinder, less stressful person. *Awaken the Giant Within* is a useful resource for those who feel that they have not attained what they are capable of attaining, as well as for those who have been successful, but wish to reach greater success. Robbins is a master motivator who has the gift of stimulating and improving the quality of life for all individuals. Unlike some other &quot;motivators&quot;, Robbins does not assert the rediculous, nor does he offer the impossible. He simply strives for bringing out the best in each individual who wishes to do so."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"If you really feel like there's something missing in your life, if you are really miserable to that point, this book is for you. But the problem is that it's not going to help you. It will make you feel great for about 10-20 minutes after you've read a whole chapter and you will feel like you have really understood something great, but I promise you that it will not last. Try it! Go ahead! I'm just trying to save you 2, 3, 4, maybe 10 years of reading his books, going to his seminars and listenning to his tapes and not changing your life in any way. I won't even mention all the money you will lose on all that stuff. If you really want to change your life, read some philosophy, get into sports, religion, or whatever you're into, but PLEASE don't increase the misery in your life by reading the &quot;teachings&quot; of that poor giant: Tony Robbins!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I've read \\"Awaken The Giant Within: How to take immediate control of your mental, emotional, physical and financial destiny!\\" by Anthony Robbins several times since I first purchased it years ago when it was written. It's a motivating book, and contains some excellent advice regarding peak performance and getting the most from yourself. This was the book that made me a fan of Tony Robbins, and since reading this I've read \\"Unlimited Power,\\" his first book, and the shorter ones that came after. I've also listened to many of his audio programs. However, it was this book, \\"Awaken The Giant Within,\\" that first got me interested in what Robbins was teaching, and that I realized he really did share some powerful ways to change your life and as he says, \\"Shape Your Destiny.\\"The paperback is over 500 pages long, so it is not a short quick read. However, it is engaging enough that it does not feel long and laborious to get through. I enjoyed reading it, and found myself energized by Robbins' infectious enthusiasm that comes through in this book just as it does in his audio programs.The book is divided into four parts: Unleash Your Power, Taking Control - The Master System, The Seven Days To Shape Your Life, and A Lesson In Destiny. The first two parts are the bulk of the book and teach the principles and strategies. Part three is a seven day plan to implement the lessons into your daily living, and the final part is the last chapter which is a challenge for the reader to do more and to take on the challenges in life and make a difference.The bulk of the book, the first two parts, focus on changing one's life for the better. The five main areas looked at to master are: Emotions, Physical being, Relationships, Finances, and Time. Robbins teaches principles of change so you can make the decisions that will effect your life. In fact, chapter two is all about decisions. Robins does a lot regarding pain, pleasure, and belief systems and how they influence our actions. He then teaches how to change through Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques.I liked chapter 8. It focused on questions. Asking the right questions can be very powerful. Robbins provides his Problem-Solving Questions to assist with working out problems, and his Morning and Evening Power Questions to help you stay motivated, grateful, and happy. Chapter 9, The Vocabulary of Ultimate Success, is also a very good chapter focusing on the words we use and how that affects us, and those around us, and how changing our language can change results, attitudes and more. Other chapters teach the power of metaphors, emotions, and goals.Part two, Taking Control, focuses on topics such as evaluating your beliefs, your values, the rules you've formed that guide your behaviors and actions, references that influence you, and creating your identity.The seven day challenge is a worthwhile exercise. I've done it and found it helpful. The seven days have you focus on elements of your life to improve. They are: Emotions, Physical, Relationships, Finances, Code of Conduct, Time, and day seven, a day of rest and recreation.Overall, I really liked this book. I guess that's why I've read it several times. I think it contains some powerful tools to assist with living the life you desire and shaping your own destiny. The key is to take the exercises and tools that will help you and then actually implement them and make the changes you desire. It's a book that really can help you take charge of your own life. And when life gets rough, and knocks you down, like it will. It's a good book to turn to for assistance during those difficulties to assist you in getting back on top.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"First of all I do think this is a powerful book. This is due more to Tony Robbins ability to generate enthusiasm in the reader and his ability to organize already-published materials than it does with his own originality though.I'm not the biggest Tony Robbins fan nowadays. I've heard him make too many ridiculous, unproven comments on his tapes to completely take him seriously. And his infomercial persona is hard to shake, but at the heart of it this is really powerful book for transformation just like he claims. It's mainly things he picked up from older self-help books and things like NLP but Tony does organize it in a usable fashion and really gets you pumped up to put some changes into effect.I went through a hard time many years ago and this book helped me turn one of the worst experiences in my life into one of the most productive, so for that I will always have a soft spot for Tony and this book.I do recommend staying away from his overpriced seminars though. Everything a smart and motivated person needs is already in this book. You do not need to pay a penny more to anyone over the cost of this book if you are serious about making life changes.I'd also like to point out that this is a tighter, stronger book than his first one, and recommend a new person start here."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Tony Robbins' second book, 'Awaken the Giant Within', is one of the best self-help titles available today. It is an excellent companion to his first book, 'Unlimited Power', and while I agree with other reviewers that 'Giant' is not as brief, still, it is not to be missed for it's excellent content. I also recommend any of his CD programs or personal seminars.One of Robbins' greatest gift is his ability to simplify the sometimes overly complex terminology and methodology of NLP into a series of straightforward processes easily understood by anyone. As a result, he has managed to make a very powerful technology for personal growth and change accessible to the masses without watering it down.Richard Bandler, one of the co-founder's of NLP, dedicates his book 'Time For A Change' to Robbins and refers to him as 'one of the few geniuses of our time'. Robbins received training directly from Bandler, and he is to be commended for being one of a handful of individuals who have paid considerable licensing fees for use of Bandler's material.I am a certified NLP master practitioner and clinical hypnotherapist and the content of 'Giant' is exceptional. In fact, it was this book that inspired me to explore NLP in the first place.If you're looking for solid success coaching 'in print' and a powerful set of practical tools and techniques for improving your life in virtually any area, personal or professional, this is a great place to start.As a professional life and career coach, I use many of the tools and techniques described in this book on a daily basis with my clients with fantastic results. Simply check the testimonials page on my Peak Performance Group website and see for yourself.But don't believe me, buy the book, and learn and practice the material until you experience the results for yourself!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken The Giant could probably be called the best of Personal Power and Tony's Power Talk tapes in print form. ATG is a huge book and perhaps thatis why so many people gave it negative reviews. There is a lot of information in here.Fans of NLP books may be a little disturbed by Tony's success. Those NLP books are not easy reading and I doubt if many of the people who recommend them understand the information or even finished reading those books. For exmaple, I met a guy a few days ago at a bookstore who was recommending some hardcore NLP books. I asked him a few questions and he seemed confused. When I told this guy he shoud read Tony Robbins books, he was aghast!I see many of those books with their silly sorcerer covers on sale at discount book stores for a fraction of their cost. Should tell you how many people keep them. That said, I own several of these NLP books myself and find them interesting albeit slow reading with very powerful advice, but they are not for Joe average reader. One exception would be NLP: The New Technology of Achievement by NLP comprehensive.The genius of Tony Robbins is his ability to present NLP (he calls it NAC and has his own twist on it) in a interesting and easy to understand manner. If you were to read and apply the principles in ATG and Tony's first book, Unlimited Power, you would have most of the information you need to create immediate change. And if you follow Tony's conditioning advice, the results would be permanent.NLP (or NAC as Tony calls it) is cutting edge technology. Beware of self promoters who are writing books and selling tapes but have no track record to speak of. I recommend Tony Robbins, Richard Bandler, John Grinder, and the NLP Comprehensive team, and legitimate authorities on NLP, people like Charles Faulkner, Steve Andreas, Robert McDonald, Gerry Schmidt, Robert Dilts, Kelly Gerling Suzi Smith and Tim Hallborn.Although non NLP related, I strongly recommend Brian Tracy, especially his book Goals and Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"\\"I really respect you as the kind of person who really wants to change the quality of your life and you're committed to doing something about it.\\" ~Anthony RobbinsAnthony Robbins' teachings present a new world for those ready to discover their destiny. I remember finding one of his books when I was just out of college and even at that point, I was not ready for his message and didn't complete the reading of what I then considered to be a very complex read. I was in emotional turmoil, having just ended a serious five-year relationship. I had no idea how to overcome such pain and confusion. I felt completely powerless.Anthony Robbins is a powerful influence if you even take five main points and start to apply them to your life. I had to walk my way out of hell, but I know now that it was the daily decisions and empowering actions that took me from complete heartache to wanting to live again.Anthony Robbins sees himself as an integral part of other people's success and this attitude challenges me on the highest level. He can take you from wherever you are now to wherever you would rather be. He teaches you how to work with pain and pleasure so you can reward yourself for success in any area of your life. This CD also introduces you to Neuro Associative Conditioning (NAC). You learn to break negative patterns and to choose a new pattern of behavior. This can help you in weight loss, getting on with your life after serious heartache (emotional trauma), overcoming procrastination, overcoming depression, ending bad habits and escaping from addictions. You could stop smoking, get out of a bad relationship, change jobs and produce any result you want in your life.This is truly a great introduction to awaken you to change. If you are experiencing more pain when you think of taking action, Anthony Robbins can help you think through emotional roadblocks so you can take pleasure in your success. You will learn how to change disempowering associations and associate pleasure with new action.Anthony's message can help you take immediate control of your life. If you listen to this message and take it very seriously, watch out...your life is going to be different. Be patient with yourself and start to focus on what you truly want and magically your life will start to change. There are some great examples of perpetual persistence that blew me away. Even one example of success could teach you an eternal principle. So many successful people have crawled their way out of complete disaster and they just kept going and never gave up.Destroy walls holding you backAwaken the power to change your lifeUnderstand how your mind, body and emotions workStart living your dreamIf you need a quick refresher course, this CD is perfect and the message will help you get back on track.

I can singlehandedly move the world.\\"Bertrand Russell stated that a good life springs from creativeemotions. Flowing from this, our focus should mirror the realitysought very closely. Empowerment may be enhanced by asking critical questions at the precise moment of crisis. Tony inspires us to stop asking questions and overanalyzing in favor ofconstructive action now. Aldous Huxley inspired us by stating\\" Words form the thread on which we string our experiences.\\"The author challenges us to pinpoint specific experienceswhich make us feel better. Once identified, we should diarizethese events to repeat them in moments of depression or melancholy. Tony explains how to minimize depression by avoidinghappenings which precipitate failure because their attainmentare outside of our control. Some of our activities simplyprovide little benefit and bring much worry and trouble. Thechallenge is to identify the useless pursuits and minimize oreliminate them to relieve mounds of worry and purposeless toil.Tony asks that we engage things that engendre confidence andhappiness, as opposed to conflict, stress and disappointment.The work is a good rendition on managing human dynamics ineveryday life. It is well worth the cost for the considerableinformation content provided. There is a word of advice.Purchase the book of course; however, once in hand- you needto apply the contents dispassionately in order to move theagenda forward. Many people tend to gravitate around theinfamous \\"analysis paralysis\\" wherein they overanalyze factsand situations until the presented opportunities disappear.Do not become one of these people. Instead, apply a modicumof analysis to good opportunities and seize them as soon asyour gut feel tells you to do so."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I bought this book on a visit to the USA from the UK in 1996. At first I thought &quot;It's probably just another useless 'Improve Your Life' type book&quot;. But I picked it up and read a couple of paragraphs and straight away I could not believe how my mind immediately started to think more clearly!! This book is a MUST for anyone who feels like they've hit rock bottom and is searching for the reason why, especially when that reason seems to occur all too often. It is thought provoking and all the changes which Anthony Robbins says you can achieve - you really can!! In all areas of your life!! It's almost as though Robbins knows you like a parent! This book has helped me to alter the actions in my life which were having a zero affect on me, and it's always there should you need to revise an area, but believe me, because this book stimulates so much in the mind, you never forget the simple to follow plans, mind exercises and so on. It is easy to read and as gripping as any of your favourite novels. Resist the urge to jump ahead to some chapters, every page is a learning curve. If you need your thoughts explained and understood more clearly then this is definitely the book for you. Definitely a small price to pay for such valuable changes in your life - changes which YOU can achieve at your OWN pace!!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have to agree with the previous reader's review . Tony has achieved enormous personal wealth by selling gullible souls on the American dream. If you can convince people that you have some special insight on how to achieve personal fortune, and then sell them a bunch of books and tapes on the subject then you too can become wealthy like Tony. That is exactly how Mr. Robbins achieved his success...by convincing millions of people through hyperbolic infomercials that his books and tapes would somehow miraculously set them on the path to personal success. But outside of that what exactly has Mr. Robbins done? What of lasting value has he created ? What new art has he created or science has he uncovered ? How many people can honestly say that his tapes and books have helped to create LASTING change in their lives ? I suspect very few if any. Robbins disco therapy is good only for a few moments of motivation."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I've owned this book for at least ten years now; and despite all the fads and phases that the self-help world has gone through (and continues to go through), Tony Robbins's \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" is the one book that I always finding myself going back to again and again.What appeals to me most about Tony's approach is that he is rooted in reality. So much self-help these days is new age cultism (or religious fundamentalism) re-packaged as \\"practical\\" guides to success. They are nothing of the sort, because they rely on FAITH--and not the faith of putting in your best and staying positive, but the religious sort of faith which says \\"blindfold me and I have faith that I'll SOMEHOW reach my destination.\\" If you want to read about that kind of faith, go to the RELIGION section, please.Tony, on the other hand, gives you truly practical techniques that go right to the core of the matter and come from REAL LIFE--not some mysterious, esoteric \\"laws of the universe\\" communicated by some otherworldly intelligence.Being an American I know that, given the economic situation right now in my country, my fellow citizens need all the PRACTICAL advice they can get to stay successful or at least provide the basic needs for their families. Having false hope in \\"the Law of Attraction\\" or nonsense as \\"just think and it arrives\\", which is all the rage in self-help movements these days, is only making things WORSE. Just when Americans need to do much more REALISTIC planning take massive ACTION to turn our economy around, they are being encouraged to sit on a pillow and just think good thoughts. Please!So thank you, Tony, for ten years (and counting) of being my best coach and keeping me rooted in the real world. You help me \\"keep it real\\" and inspire me to truly awaken the giant within."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I read this book in high school and 10 years later it still positively influences my life. A must read if you are ready to make changes in your thinking and ultimately your life."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Tony's book is powerfully packed - not only with profoundly useful steps for immediately improving the quality of your life, but also with his own personal anecdotes and entertaining stories about his outstanding life success after previous failures and frustration.Tony does NOT come across as a know-it-all &quot;guru&quot; or &quot;rah-rah&quot; motivational expert. If you read the book and actually apply the proven success principles to your life, you'll understand that he genuinely cares about people. His writing style is clear and cogent, his tone unpretentious and inviting.No doubt, he has written this book as a blueprint for success. People who follow this success plan must not follow his advice blindly though! Rather, they are encouraged to be absolutely clear about what it is they want to accomplish in life - through written goals and numerous exercises within each chapter - and then accomplishing their goals while staying true to themselves, being grateful, and helping others.Granted, you may not agree with all of his views, however, I'm convinced that you will undoubtedly find some area of your life that could use improvement - be it your health, your relationships, your finances, your emotional development, or your professional endeavors - and Tony gives you some remarkably effective tools to make that improvement a reality.Read this book with an open mind and you'll find that within you, indeed, lies a giant ready to awaken and fulfill all of your life's dreams and goals!You have the power to control your own destiny! And Tony's book helps you believe this and gives you the key to unlock that inner potential...but again, you must read it and APPLY it yourself!This book has changed my life forever! I most highly recommend it to anyone who shares the belief that all things are possible - with a dream, a &quot;massive action&quot; plan, and an undaunted spirit!Read this book, follow through, and you will never be the same!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book has already served its purpose for an immediate control of your life.You will get a quick change (but not a quick fix) as you understand some of the concepts then take immediate action.For those who wants to know some more advanced techniques for some specific development, then a simple NLP book may serve you best.I can understand that there are differences in our interest. Some people like to analyse and compare its theories to another etc. This book just does not have a textbook style of writing.For those who still consider to buy or not to buy, then the answer will depend on your outcome; an immediate control over your life?or looking for some more technical book?Tony wants people to pick the fruit and study the root later. Generally speaking his motivational stories works quickly but there are also many assignments to do, so readers can change themselves generatively. Therefore this is usually viewed as a promotional effort.Isn't it a good idea if his book can help those alot of people? especially for those who don't really like reading a textbook style of writing.My last words &quot;Use what works,and reject what is useless. Use what you have for your own benefits&quot;.I hope my opinion will be helpfull."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I have read and listened to lots of self-help material over the past 5 years in my continuing study of human behaviour and what makes us do what we do. Anthony's writings in Awaken the Giant Within are without question the clearest and most incredibly inspiring ideas that I have ever seen. I have proof too, for during the time I was reading the book and soon after completing it, I freed myself from a 12 year tobacco addiction, a very serious problem with over eating and regular abuse of alcohol. I lost 10 inches around my waist and 90 pounds in just 10 months, developed a new level of energy I did not know existed, and tripled my income. Not bad at all! I attribute all these amazing changes to ideas that I learned and applied in Awaken the Giant. These writings are an amazing yet simple set of ideas that are easy to absorb and use. My hat's off to Tony Robbins and this amazing book that helped me use my massive action mucsles for change!!!

This lead me into the areas of Self Help. Then one night out of the blue I thought: &quot;Hey who was that guy on TV late nights that I used to watch? The guy who travelled to Australia and they showed him on TV. He was always happy looking and looked built also. He was clapping his hands in tune with the music they were playing on TV? Just who was he and what was his name? &quot; I thought. I thought more and said Aha! &quot;Anthony Roberts!&quot;. I had no idea of any of his books, but I knew he must have had some. So I quickly went to my trusty Altavista search engine, typed up &quot; +motivat* +&quot;anothony roberts&quot; &quot;. To my dismay, nothing much came up. So I tried again with the last name only. Again nothing, then I tried the first name, and bingo! I realized his last name was Mr. Robbins!Guess what I did the next day? I bought his 3 best sellers. I began reading &quot;Notes from a Friend&quot; since it was smaller and I wanted to break the ice with this new author to feel his style of writing. Wow did I ever find this little book to be such a Giant Motivator! I made underlines all over it and took reference pages on the last page so I can quickly jump to any page later on when I desired to. (I usually do this and it's an excellent practice!) Then I bought a copy for my girlfriend and gave it to her as a present.I then moved on to &quot;Awaken the Giant Within&quot;. I must say this one took me around 4-5 months to finish since I read it around 4 nights a week and wanted to absorb fully all the information in this book. He has very many thoughtful ideas in there that really make one think. I thought &quot;WOW! How come I have never thought of that myself?&quot;. Here is a man, who really cares. He has devoted his entire life to helping others better their lives, and guess what? He, himself has one of the best lives on earlth! Bravo Mr. Robbins. He is an idle, a hero, a man of honesty and compassion for others. He clearly shows that if we set goals in life and work hard towards them we will achieve anything that we desire. In fact his main points can be abbreviated into five letters: CIMPA = Consistent, Intelligent, Massive, and Persistent Action! So if our actions consist of these four elements, we are bound to succeed! How true that is!If you are not going to pick this book up, you are going to miss out on many things in life. I strongly urge you to read this book as you will see how powerful the words are in it. They will not only move you emotionally and mentally, but physically as well. It is a large volume to read but the information is best absorbed slowly and through time, since our mind can take so much information at one time.Best of Luck!Thank you, Steve."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken the Giant Within is the best book I've ever read. It offers a true paradigm shift to anyone willing to take a chance and consider another way of looking at the world.Tony's thesis could be summarized as follows. The quality of one's life is equivalent to the quality of one's communication with one's self and with others. If you are satisfied with the world as you experience it, and you are satisfied with the quality of your relationships, then there's no need to change. However, if you want different results, you've got to change your actions. In order to change your actions, you've got to change your beliefs.This is the part where most people get stuck. They treat each of their beliefs like a treasured possession. Over the past three years that I've been studying Tony's philosophy, I've encountered an enormous amount of resistance to the idea of changing one's beliefs. This resistance seems to stem from two attitudes.The first attitude could be called &quot;what do you know.&quot; I've spoken with hundreds of people about their lives, and have learned to identify what Tony calls &quot;disempowering beliefs.&quot; These are simply ideas that prevent people from accessing whatever personal resources could be helping them achieve their goals. &quot;I have a bad memory.&quot; &quot;I'm no good at sports.&quot; &quot;I can't speak in front of crowds.&quot;At best these statements describe the person at the present time, but I refuse to believe that people are immutable. You might know what you haven't done, but no one knows what you could do. Of course, if you think you can't, you won't ever try. So the &quot;what do you know&quot; attitude suggests &quot;I've been me my whole life. I know better than you what I can and can't do.&quot; That's your choice, and you live with the consequences.Rather than repeat Tony's whole argument here, I will simply state that once you recognize the existence of empowering and disempowering beliefs, they are amazingly easy to identify. Then it simply becomes a matter of collecting empowering beliefs and disposing of disempowering ones. Tony shows you how.This is where the second attitude of resistance kicks in. This attitude could be called &quot;my beliefs are me.&quot; Often people agree that some of their attitudes help and some hinder their progress. But when you suggest that someone abandon an idea they hold dear, they act as if you are amputating a limb.The key here is autonomy. When I sense fear on someone's part to this idea, I offer it to them as a choice. &quot;If you want to keep all your current beliefs, of course that is your option. I'm here to suggest that you consider something new, however. If you wanted, you could look through all of your beliefs about yourself like you were cleaning your house. Polish and preserve your treasured possessions, but hold a yard sale for the old junk that's cluttering your mental attic.&quot; Again, Tony shows you how to do this.Please send me email if you'd like to discuss these or other ideas. Also check out my web site at www.leffert.com for more information on business consulting, software development, and more book reviews.You might wonder why I've approached this topic in a sort of backwards way, defending Tony in the process. It's because I'm hoping to sway the &quot;fence sitters.&quot; Those people who respect my opinion enough will just buy the book and read it. Those who don't like this sort of thing will pass it up. But I'd like to entice the skeptical readers to give it a shot. As Tony would say, &quot;Only you know who will miss out if you don't give it a try.&quot;One final note on the book. The first few chapters are not the best, so stick with it. Also, resist the urge to respond to the ideas you've heard before with &quot;that's obvious.&quot; Much of the power of Tony's ideas comes from taking them very seriously. Everybody talks about this stuff. Almost no one takes consistent action based on these principles."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"My intro to Tony Robbins was through his first book, &quot;Unlimited Power&quot; and the audio tape of the same title. At the time I was like a miniture version of Tony, newly divorced, broke and alone. Unlimited Power got me started and gave incredible results in a short time. Since then I have been a avid Tony Robbins student and also subscribe to the popular &quot;PowerTalk&quot; series. My financial life was also a disaster and through one of Tony's &quot;Powertalk&quot; tapes, I was introduced to Charles Givens. As per Tony's advice on the tape I went out and bought Givens book WEALTHWITHOUT RISK (Now More Wealth Without Risk) Givens book did as much for my financial life as Tony's book's and tapes have done for me on a personal development level. Thank you Tony for some great material and truly incredible results."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Tony is somewhat demagogic and having heard about his materialistic achievements 200 times it is sometimes too much.But but but but: Tony is very gifted and has done research in many both academic and non-academic areas and he presents the material in a great way. This book covers some basic NLP techniques but Tony applies them in a very practical and useful manner. I also bought the audio book - because the second CD is great to use for a wake-up call from the daily routine. Tony scares me because he is so well performing his \\"show\\" that he seems sometimes too good to be true. I think I would cherish him more if he sold his estate in Fiji and gave the money to charity. I think he would seem more trustworthy if everything was not measured in materialistic stuff. Being European he is maybe sometimes a bit over the edge - But he is great to listen to, very inspiring. Truly a one in a million guy - but watch your wallet. He will try to pick your pockets if you let him ;)"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I'm neither a lover nor hater of Tony Robbins. If you find his material helpful, use it. If you don't, use other stuff. That's okay!But I have tried both his book (Awaken..) and some of his tapes (Personal Power), and want to contrast them for those of you wondering which to do.Awaken the Giant IS dense. It takes time to get through and won't be terribly helpful unless you stop and do the exercises and apply the material to your life. It has TONS of information in it, more than you'll possibly get from one read, but you have to like reading, be willing to work through though parts, and be a self starter to apply it.His tape series don't generally cover the material in as much depth. It's easy to listen to and he insists you apply the concepts then and there. They can often be done in a car. If you are an auditory learner, want a more basic course, or aren't inclined to take action, the audio series is a better bet.Overall, I appreciate the incredible amount of information in the book, and the greater flexibility a book format offers. Awaken the Giant Within packs a great bang for the buck, being much, much cheaper than the tapes or CDs of Personal Power.Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"\`This book has literally saved my life. With this book I learned how to cure my 'depression.' I went to therapy for years and my hopelessness only got worse. The therapists told me that my problem was a 'chemical imbalance' so they'd put me on all sorts of toxic drugs.I was hospitalized for being suicidal back in January of 2001. When I got out of the hospital, I fell into the same patterns again and wanted to take my life. One day someone suggested this book to me. I bought it a few months later. After reading a few chapters I felt like there was hope in my life.I slowly, but surely, was getting better. I went back and re-read a lot of the chapters and learned stuff that I didn't notice before. (Repetion is good when wanting to learn anything.) Anyway, to make a long story short, I taught myself how to cure my depression and I did! I spent thousands and thousands of dollars on doctors, therapists, hospitals, etc.... I buy this [$] or [$] book and I actually learned something useful and I changed my life!I am no longer on medication and I no longer waste my money on therapy. I have learned how to solve my own problems, I have cured my depression, and I have accomplished some of my biggest goals! The only way to make changes in your life is if you are devoted to making it happen.So, if you want to improve yourself, this is the book for you. If you are lazy and won't put much effort into improving yourself, then don't buy this book.(I also recommend the book 'Unlimited Power' By Anthony Robbins!)"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book was my first introduction to the concept of NLP. Some negative reviewers commented on Anthony Robbins himself and even on his marriage - which I think is completely irrelevant to the question of whether this is a book worth reading or not. I do not know him personally and I think that it is appaling to attempt to judge his values and goals, especially knowing that he does consciously choose these.I am reviewing this book favourably for two reasons: A. It did give me that 'fired up feeling' that another negative reviewer mentioned and it did encourage me to look seroisuly at my life and at where I wanted it to go. I got into the 'drivers seat' and took control of my life. Did the feeling last forever? No, four years later I've lost track a bit and am back to reading inspirational books such as this one again. Did its EFFECTS last? Yup - I stopped smoking a month after reading this book, and that was four and a half eyars ago (I had previously tried to quit many many times and failed). I consider this the second good reason to rate this book very highly. I read a lot of books: fiction, non fiction, and mind-body-spirit but this one stands out in that it gave me real TANGIBLE benefits, not just that 'good feeling'!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"It is true you only get out of life what you put in.I refer to your thoughts and your mindset.We are a product of how we use our mind. Anthony Robbins is teaching that in this book.If you want a get rich book I would not consider buying or reading this book. This book will make you rich but rich in mind, body, spirit and material wealth will follow if that is your desire.Anthony does not proclaim to may you materially rich by using his techniques. What he is doing is showing you the power of your mind and how you can use it to enjoy your life and live it the way you want to.So ignore the critics if you are looking to change your life in any way. Learn the power of your thoughts and how you can live each day to the fullest.I was bitter and angry this morning and on reading a section from Anthony's book on the train to work I put the techniques to work and I now feel great. It is that simple. We are what we think!I have read this book 3 times so far. I think it is an important part of assisting in taking control of your own personal world."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I whole heartedly agree with the comment left by \\"A reader from Hollywood, CA United States\\" about Mr. Robbins lost creditability and new-found lack of respect for his work. I bought the books [Unlimited Power, Unleash the Giant Within, PP1, PP2, and some of the Power Talk tapes] and I'd like to comment on two things:Firstly, about Mr. Robbins himself. I do not know him but I know OF him from his books, CD's, tapes, TV, etc.... and in relation to him and of this book and works, I was deeply disturbed to hear that he was leaving his wife becuase of the following quoted from a website that you can find on google by typing \\"tony and becky robbins divorce\\"Here's an excerpt:\\"ROBBINS: It sounds like you're about to exploit it. ''I don't want to exploit the pain'' -- well...SCHUCH: But I -- but I would be remiss if I didn't ask you, Tony, because you do -- you do tell people how to be passionate, how to have successful relationships. I've listened to your tapes. And yet, you lost your marriage this year.ROBBINS: Yes, I chose to end it. It was the toughest decision I've had in my life.We had different directions for out life, different needs, different desires. We're very different people in many ways.We shared our love of people and our desire to serve. That's still why we're partners in life and a business and raising our kids. But I wanted somebody who I didn't have to, you know, her desire in terms of tempo is very different than mine. You know, it's like going out on this boat or going -- riding my Harley like a bat out of hell or dive-bombing in my helicopter. These are parts of me that for other people to be happy I was always muting. And I'm not willing to mute that anymore, because, you know, I feel like I want them to have what they want, too.(...)\\"Is riding a helicopter and a harley more important than your wife and family? I guess so if you made that to be your top values. It just goes to show where Mr. Robbins values are and what's most important to him. But it's not for me to judge Mr. Robbins. What angers me is what another reviewer mentioned, couldn't he use the \\"swish\\" Pattern-Interrupt or FIND A WAY to do these things or Change his emotional attachment to doing this to doing things together that they both enjoyed? My God man, dive-bombing in a helicopter is more important than a kiss and a hug from your Wife who has helped build your business?Secondly, in short, becuase I'm using up my 1000 word limit, this book in conjunction with the PP2 CD's [Best to buy at Ebay] offers GREAT tools if you use them. I know, I know, after reading the negative feedback, your probably wondering if it's a waste of time - it's 50/50 - depending if you use the tools offered in the book. It's like any tool in the world, e.g. money - give a fool lots of money, and it will be spent on foolishness. Give the money to an investor, and whatch your money grow.Another example, a common tool we all use - a knife. If the hands of a Chef, it's a tool to allow the chef to prepare a meal. In the hands of a killer - it's a weapon to inflict harm. In the hands of a child, you'll probably needs lots of band-aids.If you use the tools properly, you'll get the results eventually. Prior to becoming a chef, you must master the tools a chef uses. You won't get it right the first 10 times you try. But if you condition and try enough, you'll master it. The point being is that by using the tools he provides on a consitant daily basis, you'll get results your after. If you don't use the tools offered, you'll simply use your old tools and get the same old results. It's the difference between getting ketchup out of a bottle. You can try to slam, bash, etc... the ketchup bottle from the bottom and take minutes for even a drip to come out, or you could simply swish the bottle from above to below quickly and have it instantly ready. So, even if you tried the tools and didn't any results you wanted, your still in a better place then before, becuase you have new experiences and distinctions as well as a more open mind to trying other ways to accomplish your goal that you might not have though of.Finally, it's a very good starting point to increasing the quality of life for you and others if you use it.I just hope that one day Mr. Robbins will crash his \\"dive-bombing\\" helicopter and get a major \\"Pattern-Interrupt\\" and realize how foolish to let Becky go becuase he enjoyed that more than his wife and children. [Not for him to die btw...just a wake-up call - or, what he preaches a \\"Pattern-Interrupt\\". I said I was angry and resentful, not homicidal!] I believe that this makes his second divorce. You would think after reading this book or listing to the tapes or seminars that he could work anything out. Sorry Mr. Robbins, I don't buy what your selling anymore. If you can't even use the tools that you sell and promote, how do you expect anyone else too in worse situations compared to your \\"Harley Rides and dive-bombing helicopter escapades\\"? You have over millions dollars in personal assets - so I guess it doesn't matter anymore. Indulging in material wealth is now a higher value and more important than your wife, kids, work and to others who once could count on you becuase you once walked the talk. Now, you just walk to the bank."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Tony Robbins starts off in his over-the-top style by getting you excited about a variety of self-improvement techniques. I give him credit for at least providing actual exercises instead of just a lot of woo-woo philosophy like most self-help books. However, although many of these are great techniques in theory, some would take a long time to master - definitely no &quot;quick fix&quot; here. I bought the PP2 tapes and did them all, but some days the exercises were just not successful. Looking back now, I can't say that I accomplished many of the goals I set. Maybe if I had had thousands to spend working with a &quot;life coach&quot; one-on-one to train me, I would have had better results.If you're new to positive thinking, etc., you might get great insights from this book. If you've heard it all before, you'll probably hear a few things that may be new and perhaps helpful.And yes, you'll either love him or hate him. Fascinating how most reviewers either want to worship at his feet or assassinate him -not many in between. I guess when anyone makes that much money, he's expected to be perfect, and a lot of people get REALLY resentful when he's not.Point of interest - in the early days, he paid out big money to prevent a number of lawsuits when his staff accidentally got the wrong kind of wood for a &quot;firewalk&quot; seminar. About 40 people ended up in the hospital with burns. (Yes, the event is a partial trick - do some research if you're interested).Lots of hype, but a few great ideas."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"For the past 7 years I have &quot;studied&quot; Robbins, as part of a 25 year long quest, like many of you, trying to improve my life as well as understand the &quot;whys&quot; of what we do as individuals. I have read most of the &quot;alternative authors&quot; suggested in previous reveiws.Initially, I was not positive on Robbins based on his hype, selling style, etc. Yet, I still came back to his material (tapes) because they provided some great ideas and Robbins has had the opportunity to study, learn from and interact with an amazing number of successful people. Finally, about 6 months ago in reading about Robbins and his &quot;eureka&quot; moment when he was exposed to NLP, I realized that it was the material that was the value to me, regardless of the messenger.This book was in my library for 8 years and I finally read it recently based on my interest in learning about how Robbins himself became successful. This book is one of the best compliations of material on &quot;why&quot; we are the way we are, and some great ideas on how to change. (References, modeling, pain/pleasure, beliefs, CANI!, etc) It is a fantastic summary of Robbins material through 1992.

Interesting the others are also best selling authors, highly visible and positively impacting the lives of people. So I guess that Tony is in good company. Only successful people who want to share their knowledge come under attack. That is a nice group to belong to.Obviously the \\"reviewer from New York\\" at least browsed over Awaken The Giant even though they obviously didn't buy it or read the whole book. I say they because this individual did not identify whether they were a male or female. Sure posts a lot though.Robbins has taken the science of NLP and condensed it into a simple, easy to understand and more effective method of programming. I attended one of Tony's seminars in New York. They are life changing. It is not about hype and Tony never represented or attempted to represent himself as God, but only as a trainer.I'm not sure that the reviewer from New York even knows what metaprograms are and probably wouldn't be able to spell it if they hadn't seen the book or even heard of it.There except for the grace of God go I is definitely applicable to this \\"person\\" from New York. Thank God some of us appreciate the great work that Tony Robbins is doing for all of us. And no, Tony Robbins is not God nor do I think he wants to be compared with God.Awaken The Giant is a great book with powerful strategies for those who are perceptive enough to use them. Will it work for everybody? Only if you want to change and back it up with effort.1 star reviewer, you can keep posting all you want. And everytime you do post your nonsense a phrase will come to mind to those who know better:\\"There except for the grace of God, go I\\"And Thank God for Tony Robbins!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Although I read this book for the first time ten years ago, I have read it many times since. I can tell you that reading this book unquestionably changed my life. When I read this book in 1992, I was living in a 450 square foot single apartment in West Los Angeles. About 10 minutes from Tony's place in Venice. Although I wasn't overweight and alone (like Tony was) I was making only $1,000 per month selling long distance services and because I didn't have a refrigerator, was living out of a Coleman picnic cooler that I refilled with ice every couple of days. My only hope before Awaken the Giant Within was the California Super Lotto. I was very depressed and didn't see any way out of my predicament.Fortunately, a friend let me borrow the Personal Power tapes which I listened to concurrently with Awaken the Giant. All of a sudden I had hope. A concept that I could grab hold of and believe in. During the first couple of months I learned Emotional Mastery - Taking control of Myself. Although I still didn't make more than a $1,000/mo., little things no longer bugged me. I learned to be HAPPY with myself. Tony taught me to happily achieve, instead of achieve to be happy. Using the Power of Questions he teaches I developed a strong mental foundation. I then began applying the goal setting he talks about in the chapter on \\"Creating a Compelling Future.\\" The two major goals I set for myself were:1)To have my own business where I can do what I want, when I want--a place where I made all the rules.2)To travel as frequently as possible.I must say that it took several years for these things to start happening. However, the new mindset I acquired from Awaken the Giant and Personal Power enabled me to take massive action (something I could never quite do for extended periods of time before) and began to make great strides. As Tony says, \\"Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, and underestimate what they can do in a decade. Here I am ten years later, sitting at my own business, thinking about how far I have come just from making the right decision to read Awaken the Giant and follow through on most of what Tony talks about. I know deep down that there is no way I would have gotten to this point had I continued with the same beliefs I had before learning the right ones from Tony.The business has been so successful that I have actually traveled on 36 vacations in the past 5 years. Paris 3x, Hawaii 5x, Italy 2x, The Philippines 4x, Hong Kong, Sydney, Zurich, London - just to name a few destinations. In fact, I was so excited about the results I got from Awaken the Giant and Personal Power that I actually wrote a book which came out earlier this year called \\"Thank You, Tony Robbins.\\" In it, I wanted to communicate the incredible benefits of following a program like Personal Power and Awaken the Giant to all of those people out there who think that self-improvement is a waste of their time. Believe me, if you are not doing what you want, when you want - you need to start reading books like this.And let me tell you the highlight of my year so far. I was in Maui debuting my book to my parents and in-laws sitting on the lanai watching the whales jump out of the water, when I checked my voice mail in Los Angeles and received a message from one of Tony's people who said that he got my book and showed it off at a company meeting. Wow! What a difference a decade with the right books and tapes can make.If you get that sick feeling in your stomach at about 6pm Sunday night thinking about going to work the next day, you're not living your ideal lifestyle - you need buy Tony's book Awaken the Giant Within so you can start designing your dream life. Now! Don't Wait!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"i've never bought any of tony's books, nor have i paid for attendance at any of his events although i've been to &quot;date with destiny&quot; and &quot;unleash the power within&quot;... i used to be involved with someone who was a huge devotee of mr. robbins and some of the advantages of that relationship accrued to me. this person was incredibly successful and happy and she attributed it to tony robbins.i was as big a skeptic of &quot;feel-good&quot; and other &quot;self-help&quot; gurus as anyone. cynicism was my favorite sport. having said that i can say with all honesty that tony robbins changed my life. i used to throw temper tantrums, scream at other drivers in traffic... you name it. if it was childish and self-centered, i did it. i no longer act that way and i like the person i am so much better now. it has drawn people to me that i would never have met before.yes, tony has his problems, his divorce, his trophy girlfriend, etc. but he also has an incredible gift for teaching techniques that can and do change people's lives. at an average robbins &quot;live&quot; event, anywhere from 35 to 100 volunteers perform everything from security to cooking in the kitchen. you would be surprised at the number of millionaires who come to these events to work for FREE because of the power of tony's message and to help others &quot;get&quot; the message that they got. one of the messages that i &quot;got&quot; was that contribution and service is where it's at for me. not contribution and service to tony but to many other things i merely paid lip service to over the years; the humane society, adult literacy, etc.those who have posted here who feel they were &quot;taken&quot; by mr. robbins just never got the message. YOU have to want it. tony can only take you part of the way, he can open the door but YOU have to walk through it and use the techniques every day.the power of tony's message is not diminished by his personal problems. there is no such thing as a leader without flaws. the proof is in the &quot;pudding&quot;; thousands of people who lead happier and more successful lives because of tony."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I am both astounded and amuse by the negative reviews here. I wonder how many of these naysayers really tried the program. No doubt they are among the 90% that Tony talks about who buy books but never get past the first chapter.Tony Robbins is inspiring and is one of the best PD trainers in the business.For the people attacking Tony Robbins Personal Financial Power Program, no doubt you prefer to read books by some self styled (also broke and inaccurate) authors like Jane Bryant Quinn and think that the way to wealth is via savings bonds and mutual funds and reading lousy books like &quot;How to make the most of your money&quot;--ENT.How many people have amassed any wealth following Quinns advice? Believe me, Quinn hasn't developed anybody.I highly recommend Awaken the Giant and Unlimited Power. The Personal Power program is excellent. I intend to participate in the Personal Financial Power program as well. Sure beats listening to people like Quinn.Great book Tony."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Awaken The Giant is a great book by Mr. Robbins. If you haven't guessed, this book is a condensed version of his popular\\"Personal Power\\" program with transcripts of Power Talk.Robbins did not invent NLP and NAC is just another name for NLP brewed out of the legal battles Robbins had with the NLP organization. That aside, the information in this book really works.For the sake of argument, I will use NLP/NAC interchangedably be cause they really are one and the same.NLP is the new science of personal achievement and delivers results fast. For me, just using anchors and swish patterns made a tremendous difference in my sales career.As Robbins indicates, you cannot just use these techniques once and forget about them. Even after they are installed, they must be practiced, although less frequently.For me, installing anchors and using the swish patterns were very effective and realtively long lasting, but eventually the effects went away...untill I re-installed them and practiced them.No, Robbins did not invent NLP but he did the most to popularize it. Let's at least give him credit for that. And Tony has impacted the lives of a lot of people.I recommend Awaken The Giant even if you don't particularly like Robbins. Listen to the message and forget the messenger. Whatever works! NLP sure works. Give it a try. Also recommend Unlimited Power and Lessons in Mastery and SuperSelf by Charles Givens."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"While a lot of the material is good and applicable, ROBBINS constant self-promotion,story telling and pitching his overpriced seminars and other programs and products gets a little old. This books size could have been condensed easily by 1/3 to 1/2 by taking the crap out. I tried the NAC techniques and found them to be very superficial and short-lived. If you want real results, check out Brian Tracy's &quot;MAXIMUM ACIEVEMENT&quot; or Marshall Silver's &quot;PASSION, PROFIT &amp; POWER&quot;. I don't recommend Robbins nutritional program either. Like NAC, it gives a temporary, false boost.

I was out of work, depressed, confused and frustrated.Awaken The Giant turned my whole life around. I am happy, found a new soul mate and living for the first time in a long time.Thank you Tony. If ever we meet, lunch is on me!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Several years ago I began reading the work of Stephen Covey, another author who, like Robbins, wrote about leadership qualities. Covey had been a professor who researched behavior patterns in the world's leading citizens. Through his work, Covey found that most all leaders had certain characteristics that they shared in common, and he published his findings in his perennial bestseller, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Covey's work helped me through the early years of my long prison sentence, and I'm happy to have found the work of Anthony Robbins. It will help keep me focused as I move into this final decade of my imprisonment.Whether a man serves his time in federal prison camp like the ones at Eglin, Allenwood, Sheridan, or Lompoc, or he serves his time in high-security penitentiaries, like Lewisburg, Leavenworth, Beaumont, or Terre Haute, adjusting to confinement requires a long-term perspective.There are so many frustrations built into the daily activities that a prisoner who lacks control over his thoughts and emotions can begin the day normally enough, but end it in segregation or the hospital, knowing that tensions are about to escalate. No matter how bad prison experiences seem, when a prisoner loses presence of mind, he exposes himself to an abysmal downside. In order to avoid these prisoner pitfalls, I look for books that help strengthen my resolve, and I found such a book in Anthony Robbins' Awaken the Giant Within.Robbins divides his 500-page life guide into four parts, each of which provides a logical approach to conditioning one's mind for the inevitable challenges that constantly frustrate progress. Like Covey, Robbins advises us to articulate the code of values by which we want to live, then to commit to those values. He wants us to evaluate our actions constantly to ensure they're moving us toward the values we proclaim to admire.Rather than allowing obstacles to serve as an excuse for failure, Robbins suggests that we view each day as an opportunity to make the most of all that's available to us. His work provides practical strategies we can implement to improve our lives so that we're able to achieve the goals we set for ourselves.One of the simple techniques that Robbins recommends we incorporate into our lives is constant self-examination, the asking of questions to ourselves. Over 2,000 years ago Plato wrote that the unexamined life is not worth living, and Robbins wisely expresses the thought again when he advises us to ask questions that will help direct our focus, our thoughts, and our emotions.Rather than allowing interferences to block or impede the efforts we're making to move toward our goals and values, Robbins' book guides us to make better inquiries, to examine whether barriers truly are insurmountable, or whether it'' our perception of them that limit us. As we examine obstructions more closely, we can make adjustments that will enable us to move through them, pass over or around them. The questions we ask ourselves can lead to solutions, they can help us stay the course we committed to follow. It's a simple lesson, the lesson of questions, but it's one that I've noticed many fail to grasp. This failure pronounces itself loud and clear in the prisons of America.As prisoners we have no voice in the rules we are required to follow. The institution dictates when we eat, when we're to report for bed, even when we're allowed to report our illnesses to a doctor. For years we may use commodes enclosed in stalls, but a zealous guard may determine the privacy unwarranted, and without warning or explanation, remove all the doors from bathroom stalls, requiring prisoners to defecate in plain view of others, an arm's length away from the prisoners using toilets on either side of him.These basics of prison life, the regimented rules and changes that come without commentary, seemingly born out of callused or malicious minds, frustrate many. They push some prisoners to rebel against the institution that holds them, leaving any possibility for progress or inner growth as elusive as world peace. By following the principles that Robbins teaches, especially this asking of questions, even prisoners can side step the impediments of a life sans autonomy.Over the many years I've served in USP Atlanta, in the medium-security prisons at McKean and Fairton, and since 1996, in Fort Dix, I've responded to all of the problems I faced with questions. I asked myself what it was that I really wanted. I asked myself the possible ways that I could respond to the doors coming off my room, to the bad food, to the meddling prison guard or incompetent counselors. Invariably my questions led me to consider the goals I had set for myself, and that pause helped me choose a better course of action. As prisoners, we have to know where we're going. If we don't know, any road will take us there. Success, on the other hand, does not come by accident. Rather it requires a plan, and the questions we ask ourselves help us stick to it.Anthony Robbins' excellent book, Awaken the Giant Within, provides a set of strategies that help us choose actions that will ensure we become more than we are today. I recommend it to all who choose to control their future, to those who refuse to allow circumstances to control them."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. The guy from Los Angeles knows not of what he babbles.I bought this book when it first came out in hardcover and have bought several paperbacks for friends and family members. I went back and looked at the goals I set on the pages of that hardcover book in 1991 and I ACHIEVED EVERY SINGLE GOAL!!! I overcame a serious illness, met my solemate and married her, bought the dream house, got closer to God, achieved my career goals, etc. etc..I used the techniques and took the action, turned pain into pleasure and now I'm working on my next set of goals. The book is fun reading. I appreciated the areas that were highlighted, underlined and italicized for quick review. I was curious about all the negative one-star reviews and wonder if they really read the book and/or put what Tony Robbins teaches into action. However, it looks like the vast majority of the reviewers have had great experiences similar to mine. With only the exception of the Holy Bible, this book, ranks right up there with the greatest books of all time. Everything is a choice. I'm very grateful I bought this book and applied its content. It truly brought joy, love and satisfaction into my life."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Im sorry, I feel I need to comment on a recent review placed here on July 29,2003. The reader asked how did I apply Tony's techniques specifically as to be a negative review. I felt I had to answer. Also, I DID read the book in it's entirety. A lot of the techniques are a bunch of BS to start with, so I won't even mention them. The ones I took seriously were goal setting and anchoring. Goal setting was fun, and I even wrote them down, created a timeline, etc.. But I can't say I acheived them all. Out the 9 major ones I set, I acheived four of them. Anchoring is also a techinque that doesn't work as well. I actually tried it. Whenever I had a lot of energy at a particular time, or felt really alert, I would slap my thigh with my hand. (connecting a feeling to something physical)I then tried to do this when I was sluggish or lacked energy but it simply didn't work. These techniques are not scientific at all.Also, bear in mind, that, at the end of the day, no matter how great people think this guy is, he is still just an agressive salesman. What has he done that's so great? Produced a movie? Learned foreign language? Find a cure for cancer? No. All he did was sell his garbage on infomercials which he paid for. I also agree with Hucksterism's 101 comments as well. When you read his stuff, you think you discovered something great, but a week later you're back in the real world. Im not speaking without experience, either, I did his programs for years and haven't changed at all. In summary this book is nothing more than short term motivation that doesn't last."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Great book, if you like science fiction. If you are someone who simply wants to be the best he can be, maybe this book is for you. But, it being \\"the best you can be\\" means being kind to others, working hard, managing your time well, being responsible, and so on, why do you need the book anyway?The problem, as I see it, is that too many of us think that being successful (\\"awakening the giant\\", as Tony puts it) means having lots of money and having control over others. Although the author may claim ignorance of peoples true motivatioins, this is the real reason people want to buy the book, and he knows it. The message we get is \\"If you read this book, you will be almost seven feet tall, handsome, rich and influential just like I am\\". The problem is, how many of us actually have that capability?Perhaps what the author should be telling us is how to do what he does-give seminars, write books (a great deal of which he has simply lifted from other books), sell questionable ideas and refer to them as \\"technology\\" to give them credibility, and most of all, how to create scientific sounding names like \\"Neuro-associative conditioning\\" (A ripoff of NLP) and copyright them under your own name so you are the only one who can sell them.I do not question Mr. Robbins work ethic. He has undoubtedly worked hard to get where he is. But I doubt that's the only reason for his financial success.Before reading this book, here's something you should know: The Yale Study of Goals refered to in the book was revealed not to have existed! (In the purported study,several students in the graduating class at Yale were interviewed, and 20 years later only the same 3 percent of the students who had written goals were well-off financially). This is not to say the author is to blame, since he probably just found the supposed fact in another book of the genre and copied it into his own book.Just so you know, there ARE some good ideas in the book, and some of them may even help you improve some areas of your life, if you follow them. But the most important thing is, try to be realistic about yourself and your capabilies. Any thing you achieve beyond that will just be icing on the cake."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Robbins is my own personal hero. I have all his books and CDs, been to UPW and fire walked and this year became a certified life coach with his organization (Robbins Madanes). Every chapter he brings could be a whole book. His work really is that comprehensive. There is not much one can do to summarize such a massive amount of useful material. His work is inspirational and motivational and contains more secrets to human behavior than the graduate courses I had in counseling.

Imagine how wonderful it would be to be a giant. How powerful you would feel as you looked down on people much smaller and weaker than you. \\"Get out of my way squirt!\\" you would bellow thunderously as you batted away people like flies. Unfortunately, even though Anthony Robbins had a pituitary condition that allowed him to attain a physical size out of the reach of most men, he doesn't have a whole lot to tell you about growing in size. Sure there are some diet tips and exercise pointers, but he doesn't even mention using extracted and synthetic human and animal growth hormones. That said despite the fact that the title of the book could charitably be described as deceptive even if the title is supposed to be taken as a \\"metaphor\\" I still have to recommend it. Before reading this book I was aimless.

I was amazed to learn how much he knows about our brain and how it affects our behavior. I've read quite a bit on this elsewhere but never read anything that made it as easily understandable. But furthermore, Robbins teaches you how to use this knowledge to change your behavior so you can achieve real progress in your life. I highly recommend this book and Tony Robbins' teaching to anyone who is serious about becoming all they can be."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"In my opinion I think this is one of Tony's best books. His powerful stories illustrate each point very well, and this book contains a lot of great information not in his tapes - and it's also great that Tony is able to explain it all in such a clear and very entertaining manner. This is the second copy of this book I have purchased - I gave away the first and it made such a difference in that person's life that I did not want to ask for it back. Use the many exercises in the book - they can really change & improve your life if you commit to doing them. This book is as relevant and useable today as it was in the 90's. You won't regret the money you spend on it.There are so many times when I want to relax with a novel - yet at the same time I don't want the typical negative influences of modern thrillers or serial killers etc to influence my mind on my path to success and positive growth. What to read? Well I was lucky to have Horatio Alger's books recommended to me by someone who found them here on Amazon (thanks Amazon) - Alger was the Tony Robbins of his time - only he wrote \`rags to riches' novels - usually about very broke - poor - folks on the street, turning around their lives and becoming very successful - now, they are not just as simple as that - the two things that make them useful are the mental methods explain and the practical methods explained on how the change was achieved. Both of the two methods taught are just as useful today as they were when written. Re-discover Tony's 15 year old book, and discover Alger's 100 year old books! They are all great to turn around your life!

If you stick it out for the first 100 pages the book will begin to flow and you will see changes and improvements in your life."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"The book contains a set of simple practical techniques that can be applied to change your life. The book is not a miracle cure but a call to its readers for Continual Never Ending Improvement. All the techniques presented can ultimately work but Anthony forget to mention one critical thing. Before his techniques can be put to practise the reader must first learn to oberve himself and learn to become aware of his emotions. The book only has value if the concepts presented are put into practise for an extended period of time. I found the book easy to read and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"...nobody has done as brilliant a job of presenting the stuff of self-help books in such an effective manner. The book, used properly, is a book of exercises. And the exercises, if done rather than merely read, do work.Those who say that he helped them are neither liars nor shills nor cult members. He has helped and is helping more people find out how to improve their lives than any psychiatrist or social worker. How? He has not only assimilated and packaged the work of others (who he DOES credit), but he has added his own stamp. And its his additions that make all the difference. The whole that he presents is more than the sum of its parts.Don't let the man get in the way of his coaching. The coaching is brilliant. This book and his seminars have shown me how to transform my life, enabled me to retire at 52, and removed much of the scar tissue from my life.The book alone can do the trick IF you have the discipline to do the darn exercises...."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I hate long books but have to admit I love this book.As Iam not American, i accepted this book is universal is not bias towards my culture nor interfere with my religion. If everybody in New York City would have read and use this book the rate of criminals would have been minimum. The book has improved my confidence and improve my communication Skill, it has not changed my financial position but my happinness has improved. I believe those are the core of my belief. It is a wonderful book, probably one of the best book from American writer I have ever read. Well Done Anthony!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Although no book can change your life without a lot of work on your part, this book introduces you to a lot of empowering concepts, that, if used consistently, can provoke mighty changes in your life. Robbins' methods are totally unlike most of the self-help industry. He concentrates on immediate, sustained change; it's still up to the individual reader to put the material into action, but it's some material that can radically alter the way you see your life, and your interaction with yourself and other people."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"The book offers two paths through it 1) an academic read, or 2) a do it yourself project on self development. If you take it as the second it is a serious challenge. If you take the first it is similar to a host of other books.Robbins is a definitely a master of self promotion and is definitely one of the best at teaching the subject. If he wasn't I would doubt the value of the book. I have never read a good book on self development by an 'undeveloped person'.I strongly recommend the book. It is even better than his Unlimited Power."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"This book takes us as individuals apart to show us how we work and why we work the way we do. Recently I hit a ceiling as regards success falling back to earth ready to go again. Part one of the book explains why we are where we are coming to a point of stretching us to go where we want to go. The first part of the book was easily accepted and when it came to creating a future in mind I paused, contemplated and wondered how to take this new appraoch to life on on. My best advice is to try the exercises whether you understand fully where you are going to go or not and the the experiences you will have will give you a new world. Anthony understands us using a very simple model and presents us with a challenge to further ourselves.Cleasest elf help book I have read and I will read it many more times, got to condition that what of understanding!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I seldom finish a book but the information and his way of communicating is so intense and compelling that I just can't stop reading. He relays such 'a profound knowledge' so passionately that I could actually feel my heart pounding. I have always known that I am more that I am demonstrating. He literally helped me to follow through and storm through the walls that used to bother me. When I started reading this book I said to myself that this is a very knowledgable man; when I got to the last chapter, though, it suddenly hit me, &quot;Anthony Robbins is one of the greatest men alive!&quot;"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I was amazed to read the previous reviews. Was that sour grapes? Was it a bad attitude, based on wishful thinking? Was it the old &quot;give it to me for free, so I don't have to be responsible&quot; cop-out? Who knows. Whenever I read such negative comments, I'm reminded of my old outlook on life. My old way of thinking was that it was always someone elses fault. If I failed to succeed, I refused to look at the fact that it was me who did not succeed. I am responsible for my life and whatever I decide to do with it. Books are great. However, I must do the work in order to get the results. If I take a whimpy attitude and hide behind my fears, I go no where. It's easy to blame Tony Robbins, Brian Tracy, Napoleon Hill and countless others.However, look at the 4 stars this book has received. Even with the reviews from those that chose to fail and blame, this book still gets 4 stars from 154 reviews. They say only 3 - 5% of the people will succeed. It makes no difference who's plan you use, but you must do the work! I like Tony's work. I also find tremendous value in works by Brians Tracy. When I apply these principles to my life great things happen. Why?Because I change, that's why!This is a great book. It is not intended for the weak of heart or for those with no dreams or without a willingness to take action.I would bet we will see more negative reviews from these people, as they continue to read book after book, looking for the magic pill, lamp, wishing well that will do it all for them.It just won't happen. If I want it, I must go and get it. I am responsible to take whatever action is required. I must continue, while noticing what works and what doesn't, changing my course until I succeed. If they move my cheese, I must find it. If they change the rules, I must change how I play the game.I wonder how these negative failures would feel if I blamed their ideas for my failure. I bet they would certainly take the praise for my successes, even though they might be clueless on how I did succeed.Every book, written with the intention of helping the masses, is only as good as the reader is at knowing where they want to go, learning what they need to know and taking action. Find someone who's ideas are in line with your values, and give it everything you've got.If it's to be, it's up to me.To those who choose to fail, they are at least succeeding at something! They just haven't realized they made a choice."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"with any of these books, skepticism quickly comes to mind as you read through it. tony has the advantage of admitting his own failures and showing how he worked hard to understand his own inadequaticies and move forward to a more positive place. I admire that and used those examples as guidelines for myself. Was i suspicious?--yes. Do I think Tony may have used creative liberties to make his book more interesting?--yes, --but when all said and done--i gained some positive information from this book."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Go ahead. Make fun of his tan and the infomercials if you want. The reality is, Tony Robbins is the real deal. I've been listening to his tapes for years. Few come close to making as much sense and giving me the kick in the pants I sometimes need to get (and keep) life and business on track. &quot;Awaken the Giant Within&quot; contains much of Robbins' most powerful material. Get it. Read it.

If I am with this guy and I think he needs Tony Robbin's help, maybe I need this more.&quot;It was then that I bought &quot;30 Days to Unlimited Power,&quot; followed by &quot;PowerTalk&quot; tapes, this book, and one other book by Tony Robbins.Between 1989 and 1995, I studied Tony, along with every book that he mentions, in this book, as well as in all of his tapes.The power of reading this book, taking copious notes, being willing to enhance who you are, nets you immeasurable results.I advise anyone to read this book, to bring out more of yourself, while you notice that it is not Tony Robbins, his expert testimonials, nor the book that will make you into something different - it's you, and the unwavering convictions that you hold."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Trust me, I am not in any way associated with Robbins companies or himself at all. I am certain that he is a very good helpful teacher. In spite of some negative reviews posted here, the fact is that in 1997, I was really messed up in too many ways (addicted, labeled severely depressed, suicidal and other disorders by psychiatrists and in deep trouble...........)and since then this good man's wise, positive, loving energy and smart teachings have helped me heal and tremendously improve in all ways including spiritually.Robbins' stuff is especially smart to listen and read considering all the unbeneficial, even harmful junk that many people choose to input into their nervous system these days. I have learned the hard way that even the smallest stuff one chooses to read, watch and listen certainly do affect a person's well-being, happiness and success by either harming or benefiting. One must choose very wisely.Thanks to Robbins, I certainly am really doing excellent in all areas as well as healthwise now. With Mr. Robbin's help and of course my own diligent smart effort, I freed myself from all harmful addictions; I feel excellent, truly inspired about doing a lot of good, very energetic and healthy. I have done very well.God bless Tony Robbins more,Mehran Mehryar"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"\\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins is most definitely the book that I would strongly recommend to all people. Rating it on a one to ten scale, it will receive a perfect score of ten.This is a great book of self-empowerment written by a man who has been through it all, from rags to riches, from loneliness to abundance. Anthony Robbins has done a great deal of research to finding the key to great success and happiness physically and mentally. All the formulas that he suggest in the book includes well-done researched backup statements. His book is like a bible on how to live life to it's fullest.Although I have not finish reading this book, I have already developed great confident in the researched ideas it contains. Robbins is able to illustrate even the most complex ideas and break them down into more understandable phrases. The situations he speaks of in this book can relate to practically anyone in this society whether you are rich or poor, happy or not. Even people who live in different worlds can relate to this very one book. If you came across a certain topic that does not apply to you, you can go on and skip the chapter, but even if a topic does not apply, it is still interesting to read.After reading a portion or just chapters of this number one seller, you most likely will feel more refreshed than when you picked up the book. So each time you put the book down after some time of knowledgable reading, a great sense of self-empowerment will fill your mind.****It's a FOUR STAR rating!!!....Amy Leung"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I've had this book for 14 years now...and I refer to it often over the years. A lot of great ideas on change, patterns, beliefs, values and emotional states. But one must APPLy and take action for anything to work...that's the hard part for me!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I bought this book when it first came out and have read it through several times. I just wanted to respond to a previous post where an individual had made an interesting judgment on Tony's 6 steps to lasting change as something which he was promising to be a permanent fix, where in fact he does the opposite, in NLP the P stands for programming, implying a permanent change where Tony refers to the word conditioning which is something the individual has to commit to on an ongoing basis. As an athlete who has trained with proffesionals I'm aware of the daily implementing with great effort and hard work, the basic fundamentals of physical habits specific to that persons sport and how that individual must stay on top of his efforts if he/she is to excel. I'm also aware if that same person was to not train for 1-3 months how even a basic drill would deterioate, the talent may still be there but it would still require re-conditioning the right habits and that is what ATGW is all about. Tony is also big on intensity anything done in a dull lifeless state won't have any lasting positive effect and probably none at all, this is not a book to be read in a leisurely fashion, it is all about action, the only thing the author claims is that making decisions and taking action on them will change your life, the rest of the book is just tools in assisting yourself to overcome any fears or anxieties which might prevent you from taking action, really if you wanted to make great change without purchasing any books just set a clear outcome and take action.I've trained for NLP qualifications and found many things useful, however most conduct thier training in a zombified hypnotic state, I felt that was de-humanizing and was very uncomfortable with it, Tony is the opposite and far more in touch with the real world when it comes to hands on practical in your face advise, this guidance to the present moment is what can make you feel alive and vibrant. I've even had one on ones with NLP specialists and it seemed like they were doing more damage than good, I've honestly got more solutions from being in row Z in a Tony Robbins seminar.Constuctive critisms would be some of the stories being too long and Tony's reference to the extreme which he uses to shock people into thinking which is a little over the top for my taste. Also for Tony Robbins and NLP authors alike their work can sometimes imply our faith is something made up, it may be true that their is a belief system in place but ultimately weather a person is a Jew, Chritian, Muslim or of any other faith it shouldn't weaken their faith. In this sense I believe we can construct our lives with positive choices but ultimately Christ determines my destiny."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I am forty years old and A.D.D. has effected myself and those around me my entire life. Disorganized, rash speech without thought, lack of direction, zero focus; I am a poster child for A.D.D. Anthony Robbins book, \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" has changed the course of my life. It has shown me how to take personal responsibility for my words and actions and how mindset and the course of one's destiny can be immediately altered through the simple act of questioning and decision. I have courage and drive that I never knew existed. What a gift to finally figure out that I have the complete power to re-program my mental pathways and adjust the outcome of any situation that arises in my life. This book teaches you the art of positivity, fearlessness, passion and thankfulness. I am excited for all of my future possibilities as well as the wonderfully miraculous things that are unfolding in my life presently, thanks to a new awareness brought about by this book. I feel as though I have just awakened from a deep sleep.

I've just started re-reading this book, and the chapter on goal setting is excellent. He's exactely right ... getting to the \\"why\\" of any goal is critical. If the \\"why\\" isn't strong enough, you're just wishing for something nice to happen. Commitment, focus, discipline, purpose ... these traits have all been known for centuries, but Tony actually does a nice job of creating motivation to make it happen.

How about an unabridged audio book in 2012 - The 20th Anniversary Edition."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"The way Anthony Robbins writes is a way that just flows, providing for an easy read. I've listened to some of his tapes before and his writing style is almost like the way he speaks. I'd previously heard of NLP before but was not really sure what it was about and this book has provided me with a lot of insight about people and myself that I did know before. Have you ever had those moments in your life when you've seen, read or heard something and you thought to yourself \\"ah ha, I get it.\\" That is what this book has done for me. I've had that experience tons of times while reading this book.

Well, Tony Robbins has created a masterpiece with \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\".Too many self-help books just give people excuses to wallow in their misery and frustration. But \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" provides a plethora of ways to help anyone turn their negative feelings and emotions around into positive, constructive ones. Robbins uses techniques such as neauro-associative conditioning to help his readers take control of how they think, feel, and act. He pairs this with stories of famous people's journeys to success that are nothing but inspiring.I have had the pleasure of seeing Tony Robbins live at one of his weekend long seminars and it is a life changing event. After the seminar I bought this book to continue the experience and everything mentioned in his $800+ seminar was mentioned in this book for a fraction of the price!

Any criticism by readers is due to their own lack of long-term initiative to maintain the regimen of success designed by Tony Robbins.Approaching the book with an open mind is vital. I found it to be life changing, because the one thing he focuses on is CHANGE. For those who refuse to follow his threefold strategy-- [raise your standards, eliminate self-limiting obstacles, and take massive action]-- there is always room for doubt. However, for those who have the self discipline to finish what they start, this book can be the best thing you've ever read! It was for me. Little wonder that Toney coaches world leaders on a regular basis."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"What a hoot that Tony Robbins is getting divorced! I'm not to worried about Becky, with even a chunk of Tony's 200-300 million dollars, she should be set for life. Tony is in his 40s and Becky is a little bit older. Let's face it, men like young blondes and Tony has traded his middle-aged wife in for one (read &quot;mean genes&quot; to understand why). He claims that he couldn't ride his Harley and fly his helicopter enough with Becky, but that is a pretty flimsy excuse. Men want what they want and when they have 200 million dollars they generally get it or take it. I'm a guy and would probably do the exact same thing.As for how he made his money, it was just by promising a gullible publice they could make money. There are plenty of depressed and desperate people out there for him to prey on. His nutriional advice will only increase depression in many people. There is too much sugar and not enough protien in it and for people with my biochemistry it is big trouble - more depression and bad moods. And after that I would need another hit of a new Tony Robbins tape.But what has the NLP master accomplished? Does he speak foriegn languages? Can he memorize hundreds of names? What?

No one (except you) thinks about \\"meta-belief\\" (or belief about beliefs) when trying to solve problems in their lives. Take the example of a burning building. You can decide to jump out the window, or choose to ponder which leg should be the first one to stick out the window on the unsubstantiated premise of a cushioned fall. Only you, pal, would dilly-dally on which leg should go first. The rest of us would just jump!The fact is, \\"beliefs about beliefs\\" are an exercise in question begging.

Not a day goes by that I don't find myself using techniques and technologies that I have learned in the book.I would go so far as to say that, if well utilized, the information available in ATGW could have as much influence on a person's mind as a four years College course."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"My review falls some where in the between the reviews discussing the overwhelming amount of FLUFF contained in this book and the fact that Robbins' excercises can work!!! This 500+ page epic should really be revised by robbins to help readers concentrate on the true main points he is making. remove a three quarters of the anecdotes and and integrate the small subjects of vocabulary and metaphors into the bigger more overarching principles and remove about half of the crappy quotes sporadically placed in the book and you might have something worthy of 4 squares or at least 3 1/2. But no matter what read it get the brunt of the book and its message and prepare yourself to not agree and not follow through and its OKAY!!!

Every day we think mainly the same thoughts over and over again. The media, parents, family, friends, teachers.... these all influence us without us even thinking about it. In our brain/nervous system, these repeated thoughts form a \\"rut\\" of sorts. A deep groove in the record... resistant to changing tracks.Tony masterfully uses NLP to wake us up. Help us to jump out of the rut.. move into a different life using new beliefs that work for us, instead of those historical messages we keep sending ourselves, despite them not working any longer. His approach to resetting our beliefs to those that work for us NOW, is powerful. The exercises help engrain these new beliefs to work for us from now on...After all these years, this book is still groundbreaking. Perhaps it is because so many people still haven't caught on to how powerful it is. (That will include all those that read the book expecting a miracle without making any changes or doing any of the exercises in the book. Would you expect to lose 50 pounds without changing anything in your life? DO THE WORK! Knowledge isn't power.. ACTIONS are power!)I have had the pleasure of meeting Tony after realizing some fantastic changes due to his courses and books. This is a man committed to helping others be the best they can be. This is a man that walks his talk. Meeting him and thanking him allowed me to realize that this is not just a job ... this is his passion.This book will change your life... if you seriously want to change it.

First, as a Christian, they often offer wisdom and advice that is contrary to what I believe to be the truth. Second, so many of them are saying the same old thing. I'm also usually a little bit wary of those who become celebrities, such as Tony Robbins. But in spite of these caveats, I found that Tony Robbins' \\"Awakening the Giant Within\\" offers sound practical advice that will very likely change your life for the better. It also happens to be that what Robbins teaches, while not from a religious perspective, is consistent with Christian teaching and that of other religions as well.In short, this is a powerful book that teaches transformative principles: and you should read it and even study it. When I first read it more than 15 years ago, it set into motion a number of important, positive changes in my life that are still bearing fruit in my life. Every time I look back at the book, or part of it, I still learn something new. While Robbins is not necessarily original, he is an amazing synthesizer and presenter.

First, as a Christian, they often offer wisdom and advice that is contrary to what I believe to be the truth. Second, so many of them are saying the same old thing. I'm also usually a little bit wary of those who become celebrities, such as Tony Robbins. But in spite of these caveats, I found that Tony Robbins' \\"Awakening the Giant Within\\" offers sound practical advice that will very likely change your life for the better. It also happens to be that what Robbins teaches, while not from a religious perspective, is consistent with Christian teaching and that of other religions as well.In short, this is a powerful book that teaches transformative principles: and you should read it and even study it. When I first read it more than 15 years ago, it set into motion a number of important, positive changes in my life that are still bearing fruit in my life. Every time I look back at the book, or part of it, I still learn something new. While Robbins is not necessarily original, he is an amazing synthesizer and presenter. Here, then, is an outline of the best of the wisdom this book has to offer.I. 3 Steps to Create Lasting ChangeA. Raise StandardsB. Change Limiting BeliefsC. Change Your StrategyII. 5 Areas to MasterA. EmotionalB. PhysicalC. RelationshipsD. FinancialE.

How am I going to live the next 10 years of my life?2. How am I going to have to live today in order to create that future?B. Decisions, not conditions, determine destinyC.

The wisdom available can and will change your life if you apply it. I have benefited GREATLY from using this information. It can and will change your life if you apply the information on a regular basis. Read it, study it and apply it and you will have fantastic results in your life as I have. Tony's success with thousands and thousands of people around the world is proof of the power of this information. You can have the same information that he charges thousands for at his seminars for just a few dollars. The more time and effort you put into study of this material the more you will benefit.I have found the chapters on values and the pain and pleasure principal very helpful in my life.

While most of these \\"self-help\\" type books are very similar in approach, and Tony is no exception, the similarity is because they are effective. The book itself is broken into 4 parts - which broadly speaking are focused on:Self Evaluation and DiscoveryDevelopment of Focus and DisciplineA 7-Day Kick-start Rapid Change and Focused Action PlanDiscovering Our Destiny and Making a DifferenceIf you just do a fraction of the activities in the book, you will come away with a clearer understanding of yourself and your values. Couple that with a bias to action, and your life will improve. Most of us have a fear of action and a fear of the mirror.

See, all you have to do is decide what you want to do, convince yourself you can do it, and keep at it until you've done it. What could be easier, huh? He informs us that we do certain things because they bring us pleasure. We don't do other things because they bring us pain. Wow, how insightful and original can you get? If you have a belief that's bringing you down, well, scrap the belief. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. If you're in a relationship that's bringing you down, well, scrap that too.

(mentally clearing throat sound)...For a couple of reasons, this poor unwashed reviewer suggest that if you like this here tome on personal change strategies you'd do much better to listen to Anthony's *Powertalk* tape series. Tony is a competent hypnotist, he uses his vocal range and tonal shifts to good effect. Little of this &quot;installation by Tony&quot; effect happens when you read the book (which I supposedly didn't read, but lets create a big mental movie of me (however you imagine me to be) reading the book, so you'll find what I'm saying more congruent with your (wildly innacurate) PRESUPPOSITIONS....) Ok ? nice pretty movie all done ?... goody...So, azz I was saying, you'll get a LOT of useful mileage out of his Powertalk series, Tony's good stuff served straight up with a bare minimum of static... the book's treatement of &quot;asking the right questions&quot; is boring and dry, but the Questions Powertalk is really smokin' good when Tony breathes life into his subject... when you go back and reread the Questions part of the book (which I supposedly did not read, so run your head movie here at the sound of the imaginary BEEP), you think, ech, I should LISTEN TO THE TAPE AGAIN... (hint)... Tony feels that the Question &quot;piece&quot; is the most central to his success strategy, hence if you want to bypass a lot of the phluph and get right to the hot'n'heavy core of what makes this dude tick... listen to the Questions tape, like everyday for a week until it soaks DEEPLY into the white matter of your brain...Once you got that rooted in better than a twenty year old oak, listen to his tape on REFERENCES, another thing that in the book is blaaaah... his trancework isn't as hot on References, and he does push the idea that doing the Firewalk is a Reference you just can't do without. Nice little embedded command Tony, but thanks just the same. Seminar plugs aside, References is a real mind opener and probably out to be distributed free in high schools to make kids a little less grossed out by the idea of education.... again, in the book it's, OK, great, got it, next, uh what ?A third one I thought a lot of was the Six Master Steps to Change which is out of print but you can get them used here on Amazon. Six Steps is another good case of cutting through the hype and doing good changework. Really the nut of what Tony's change technology is all about. Plus he uses one of good old Dave Dobson's moves, happens real quick, but it is a goodie. Scramble pattern well presented, amazing little piece of business to move you strongly away from liking chocolate (har! nice!) and an interview with Mark McCormick (what the didn't teach you at harvard business school...for you business types)...Anyway, in my considered opinion, Tony has his warts but he's got a lot of good stuff, and he's got a lot of filler, padding, and whatnot too. The smart move is to get the Powertalk tapes which is the best concentration of real work, the book by comparison is a total snooze."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Curious statement to make, NLP/NAC wise, innit ?How does one do a thorough NLP &quot;metaperspective&quot; on this statement ?What are the presuppositions here ?(there but for the Grace of Tony go I ?)

I can't wait to give him more money for his next book or tape or whatever!"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I was hooked on Anthony Robbins for years. I knew this book and &quot;Unlimited Power&quot; inside out. I fire-walked at the landmark &quot;Unleash The Power Within&quot; weekends and booked others into it. I followed all the skills, psychology and techniques daily in my Executive business life in the Information Technology industry. And I was indeed getting everything I wanted!! So what is wrong with that?Speaking for myself, what I ultimately discovered was that the whole philosophical and spiritual premise of the 'Human Potential movement', of which Anthony Robbins is perhaps todays leading exponent, is a fallacy. Indeed, that fallacy is oldest naive deception from one of the oldest books.The foundless premise is that knowledge and skill is all that it takes to gain mastery of your life. With Anthony Robbins as one of my leading &quot;self-improvement&quot; Pied Piper's, I had made science and psychology necessary to achieving my ends. As Robbins puts it so well (p107) &quot;the more I learned, the more addicted I became to learning even more. Understanding how to influence human emotion and behaviour became an obsession for me.&quot;The implication is that the world is divided into the skilled haves and have nots. Those without such skills and knowledge are underprivileged. But if only you will let Tony show you how, you too can be one of the beautiful people &quot;obsessed&quot; and &quot;addicted&quot; to the path of knowledge. The premise that knowledge and skill is all it takes was of course first encountered in the Garden of Eden. Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil instead of the Tree of Life (Genesis 2:17, 3:1-13). The Tree of Knowledge included Good too.... Thats what still makes it look so attractive.Choosing whether to live our life by the Tree of Knowledge (dependence upon man and science) or the Tree of Life (dependence upon God, where science is just a tool) is indeed a &quot;moment of decision by which your eternal destiny will be shaped&quot;, to use Robbins credo.Like Adam, you can decide whether to put your faith only in human knowledge. Or in the Creator of the universe. For the price of this book, you are taking the ultimate gamble. Is God's Word true &quot;that you will surely die&quot; (Genesis 2:17) if you only look to faith in yourself? Or is that just religious claptrap - as Lenin put it, &quot; the opiate of the masses&quot;? Your decision. Your ultimate and eternal &quot;moment of destiny&quot;, in Robbins parlance.Here is a just small sampling of the falsity of major Robbins themes from an unabashed Christian perspective.WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?1: &quot;Unleash YOUR Power&quot; (Part 1)False premise. Jesus Christ taught that the pursuit of human-based power is entirely ephemeral and egotistical - indeed evil. Christians believe the key issue is the source of righteous AUTHORITY. Indeed, the pursuit of personal &quot;unlimited&quot; power is the antithesis of Christ's message. Christ set the example by emptying himself of all human &quot;power&quot;. But By becoming the servant of all and sacrificing himself in place of humanity for all time, Jesus Christ gained true authority. Christians believe that this godly authority is GIVEN to humans by Grace - not TAKEN or seized in the Robbins firewalking mould. And only by accepting who Jesus Christ really was and what he was on about. &quot;** I ** am the way, the truth and the life, and no-one comes to the Father but by [belief in] me&quot; (John 14:6)2. Decisions: The Pathway To Power (Chapter 2)Christians agree that decisions are indeed of crucial importance. However, what is important is not the decisions, but the benchmarks by which they are made. Does the history of humanity give you full confidence in your ability to make wise decisions?By what benchmark do you know whether what you WANT is right or wrong? How the heck do you know that what you WANT is, in fact, what you as a unique individual really NEED?Nothing in \`Awaken the Giant' addresses the fundamental question of the morality of right or wrong. Robbins sidesteps this with an amoral, humanist, existentialist approach of \`whatever works for you'.Here and at Robbins seminars you find that the process of discovering what you think you need is by putting yourself into a peak state meditation where your &quot;life goals&quot; are drawn out from deep within - your own ego. This process also leave you wide open to occult influences. Christians believe that what humans really need is clearly outlined in the New Testament in particular. Prayer is the way we were designed to converse with God, not ourselves.3. The Force That Shapes Your Life (Chapter 3)- &quot;The single driving force behind all human behaviour is pain or pleasure.&quot;But when Jesus Christ was asked to summarise the single driving force that shapes life, He did not say &quot;seek pleasure and avoid pain&quot; - the heart of Robbins entire thesis. What He did say was &quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and mind. And love your neighbour as yourself.&quot; (Matthew 22:37-39).Seldom has a more breathtaking presumption been taken in literature than Robbin's brazen assertion that &quot;Donald Trump and Mother Theresa are driven by the exact same force.&quot;(p55) Robbins explains; &quot;It is absolutely true that their values lie at opposite ends of the spectrum, but they're both driven by pain and pleasure.&quot;Well, one thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is this - that statement is a complete travesty. Every minute in Mother Theresa's life after conversion was sustained first and last solely by faith in Jesus Christ through the working of the Holy Spirit. Hypothesising that as a psychological reaction to pleasure and pain debases the entire Christian faith.In summary, although there are many valuable and inspiring insights in this book, the old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions applies. Caveat emptor.Randall King rking@cuscal.com.au"},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"I've had more than one copy of this book over the years and it's helped me out a lot. The techniques are simple, do-able and powerful. They help you with focus, mental and emotional control, give some moral inspiration which is everything. Good=good, getting to moral and emotional goodness is all that's important in life. There's not enough on critical thinking, but you can get that elsewhere.There's also very valuable information in here - and his other books - about NLP - Neuro Linguistic Programming, which everyone should know - especially since governments, secret and manipulative groups, scientists, people with money and abusive power, manipulative predators - are all using it. Often against women (read \\"The Game: Penetrating the Secrets of Pickup Artists\\" by Neil Strauss. You should be aware that some predators use this stuff calculatingly - not just sexual and cruel emotional predators, but people that mean to do you physical harm, some of the techniques these so-called experts use are also abusive by their very nature), they also target children, consumers, heroes, human/animal/women's/gay rights activists etc... and they combine it with tech and other manipulative techniques to harm, spy, abuse, trick and steal from you etc... They use very manipulative, abusive, intense emotional techniques and you NEED TO DEFEND YOURSELF. Intense emotion is not bad if used for good, it's when it's used by predators it's a problem.Women be aware: Did you know there are more than one secret \\"brotherhoods\\" that are controlling, manipulating and using your lives in various ways, like the Freemasons, secret religious groups which are usually male supremacist and use terrible abusive tricks and techniques to keep \\"women under control?\\" That your freedom of speech and freedom to participate in the government and policies of this world governments is mostly a lie? That these secret \\"brotherhoods\\" manipulate politics, business, have networks, prevent others from rising, regularly harm women, children and animals and are not answerable to anyone?! WAKE UP RIGHT NOW. Image, psyche warfare and keeping information from us is their #1 priority.Religions have been using these techniques for a loooong time in very abusive ways. It's the CONNETICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT phenomenon. They use tech, and psyche tech to convince you they are gods, or spokespersons of gods to get stuff for themselves. Often to torture, abuse, and assault you. They film your life without your knowledge and consent, use blackmail and false evidence to frighten you. CONNETICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT was very polite about what they do. It's much worse. I think big religions and small are being used like Jonestown - calculatingly to see if they can get us to kill and abuse on command. Many of these people are male supremacists and are using them to connect (or trigger - techniques described in Robbins books) your sexuality to being their \\"literally!\\" slave and even be willing to torture and sacrifice your children! Triggers, reframing techniques, language, physical and emotional selling techniques... Christian, Islamic and other religious male supremacists are definitely aware of these techniques, they study them. White supremacists have ADMITTED that they use women as breeders for their armies. Male supremacists are also. you are spending your lives defending things which are CRUEL and VILE to yourselves and your own children just because THEY ARE GOOD SALESPEOPLE. Catholics and some religious sects have many, many children - up to fifteen some of them. They are VERY organized groups that are deliberately trying to take your liberty, dignity and even your right to protect your children (and certainly animals) from you. Often if you find out, you will be targeted and they have techniques to make it all (or you!) go away. They will trick you into humiliating or harmful experiences and then film it to threaten you with. How to tell if you are being manipulated for good or bad with psyche tech:Bad will lead you to abuse, torture, victimization, loss, loss of freedom, dignity, respect, love etc.... even if they talk about goodness (Hitler and his like, liked to talk in highly emotional terms about love), they will somehow take the thing they are talking about away from you and you will see evidence of it. If it leads you to kindness to those you have power over, freedom, dignity, equal good for all gentle non-predatory people, feeling good ABOUT GOOD THINGS etc... it's fine. If it tries to make you FEEL GOOD ABOUT BAD THINGS then it's most likely predator propaganda. For instance, Christian male supremacists try to make you FEEL GOOD about your LOSS of FREEDOM AND AUTHORITY if you are a woman. They will try to connect sexual pleasure to loss, like in their submission/slavery/sexual triggers. THIS IS CALCULATED which they hope will make us not seek freedom and participation in governing ourselves, or payment for our labor, (often for many raised in these cultures - the grunt work of society, cleaning toilets, cooking, care-taking of elderly, animals, men, children, which is the reality for many of us etc) Also, to loss of personal choice and the ability to defy them and make choices for our own good. DO NOT REGULARLY CONNECT YOUR SEXUAL PLEASURE TO DOGLIKE EMOTIONS OF SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE. DO NOT REGULARLY CONNECT SEXUAL PLEASURE TO PREDATION, WORDS LIKE \\"TAKEN\\" (rape or being taken against your will) POSSESSION (slavery) or extreme violence - all traditional techniques, deliberately designed to make your psyche conform to very abusive people's plans. The first thing they do when challenged on these things is have some trained person MOCK AND IMAGE CONTROL IT. Be aware. Often they will disguise these image control people as women's, animal, or children's rights people, they have people already in place EVERYWHERE. (The whole \\"wolves in sheep's clothing trick.) How to tell an infiltrator from a real activist is not always easy, because the very techniques disguised in this book can create image illusions that are ver convincing. The CIA practices many techniques like this.They also try to make you not question their reality and use techniques to try to get you to have BLIND TRUST. That is, to trust them as they HURT YOU and STEAL FROM YOU. As well as techniques to take your REAL EMOTIONS from you. That is, if you are upset about your children being abused, animal torture, or your own loss of control over your life - they will use tactics like in THE GAME (which is not a game, people have been TORTURED AND KILLED) - they will begin to INSULT YOU AND BLAME YOU or OFFER YOU REWARDS for agreeing to harm yourself, your children, or others that can't defend themselves. They will claim you are bad and a sinner even though you try to PROTECT THE SMALL, like children and animals, which they refuse to do. Some of the ways they do it are mentioned in all NLP books like this one. These are traditional cult-like, deliberately manipulative techniques - some cults get huge - major religions are cults - and women NEED TO FIGHT BACK RIGHT NOW. Watch the Stoning of Soraya M. We're already there in this country. Both men and women are being killed for dissenting against corrupt men's pretend religions which have taken over the government. Women are a deliberate target - however heroes, those who defend gays, feminists, animals or anyone who proposes equal kind or compassionate ideology are targets. Corrupt men - almost solely men, are defining morality for most people without the free participation of others - dissenters are terrorized or conveniently REMOVED. People who genuinely love you, also want every good for you. The moral use of freedom, freedom from pain and harm. They should want every good that they themselves seek. If they want things for themselves, which they are deliberately trying to withhold from you, then doubt they have your best interests at heart. This book, and others, helps illuminate the techniques to use responsibly to defend yourself and to recognize the misuse of power in others. Oh, also be aware that you may get altered versions of books that the \\"brotherhoods\\" don't want you to have. They track your buying, and keep information from certain people, by giving them \\"special\\" books that have been edited, or censored.Sometimes unconnected, heroic, or young, idealistic men are a target - they sell you predation and war, abuse and greed, trick and lie about you, and try to make you into their \\"toy soldiers\\" for their stupid predator armies. Understanding these techniques are part of the defense strategy and reading these books will help you figure it out. Do not let people sell you the abuse of animals, child sacrificial rituals, abuse, slavery, or oppression of women, or the same with good men, unnecessary or hyped up wars, or other abusive ways of living. It destroys us, morally, emotionally, and in the end physically. They forgot the basic equation all goodness comes from. Good=Good. You cannot deviate from this equation without harming yourself and sowing your own and others destruction. We all pay every time they sucker someone.So yeah, all people should definitely know about the abuse of these techniques - however, on the flip side, there's much good in some of the techniques it if it's above board and honest. For instance, learning to speak others language can be good - ever be around a friend and you start acting and talking like one another and \\"fall in love with one another\\" because you have so much in common? I wouldn't use this for bad things, scummy business techniques, abusive religions, or other manipulative lying reasons, but as a technique to get enthusiasm for another's life and joys it can be fun - as long as you both know it's an effort to speak each other's language and not an attempt to manipulate someone dishonestly, which adds to the collective stupidity and cruelty of the world.As for the self-help information, it really does help. Simple solutions have guided me through some tough stuff: For instance, asking empowering questions - this one simple technique - has really helped me many times. I make up my own sometimes and change them to my circumstance. What can I feel thankful for today? How can I improve my situation even in small ways? What weeds, or problems do I need to deal with today? How can I enjoy some process I'm avoiding? What (even small!) step can I take to improve my situation. Actually helped me survive a prolonged terrible, terrible depression. If it sounds a little corny and optimistic, maybe so, but corn is nourishing, it really does work. The truth is, being a positive thinker, won't always solve everything, but it gives you a fighting chance. I think even manic depressives make it through a little better because they're trying hard to be up - versus those that despair and just end it. Being willing to look silly, or whatever to others can also help, because being positive in negative situations can be silly to some - the alternative is to suffer all the time though and looking silly is a lot better than looking dead. I had someone I loved dearly end his life recently and I just keep thinking, if he'd known something, a little technique, a little extra help, it might've got him through. Maybe not, sometimes the problems truly are harming and trapping you, but still, I wish he'd had every weapon in his arsenal to help him.He mentions it's not good to ignore the weeds, that is, not ignore suffering or problems and just \\"focus on the good things\\" alone, but being able to do that SOMETIMES is very healing. When you're in pain or in grief, you can't forget what's wrong, but to be able to forget for a while and see good in your situation can help you when you can't go on. I like him better than other self-help authors for that reason. I recommend a combo of dealing with weeds and focusing purely on good - if you need the good, go for it. Pain control is any creature's right. On the other hand, don't disconnect yourself totally from the truth of the bad in your situation, while you're doing it, or you will not be able to deal with real world problems.When people get emotionally connected to the reality of loss and suffering, it is a painful life where you have difficulty making it through the day. Reminding yourself to try and reframe things - another technique in this book, can really help you make it through. On the flip side, reframing can be horribly stupid in some situations. Reframing my loved ones death will not take his loss away, nor will it make something good that isn't. I don't recommend pretending that something that is bad is good, because it can also be dangerous. What if I tell myself there's life after death and there isn't? And people in my life soak in that idea and don't take the necessary steps to genuinely extend their lives with new technology etc...? Reframing is only good if it's TRUE. One place I know where it has seemed good to me, is people who are self-conscious about their looks etc.... maybe they're overweight, not in an unhealthy way, or surrounded by people who are catty and overly critical etc... - reframing the picture and seeing the beauty in it can give you joy. I've seen many people who are average or above size look incredible - genuinely so, just by reframing how we see beauty, looking for alternative or indie images of self-expression. I see Big Mamas and Guys and adore. Some young people today look incredible, or charismatic in their own skin and can compete with the most charismatic performers of the past and do it in their own skin, I'm kind of in love with the pure guts and glory of it, their presence is a reframing of negative, unhealthy models.There's a section on using words in positive ways, and a list of interesting words, joyful words etc.... The awareness of language is really good aspect to this book. Remember when mom used to say \\"Watch your language!\\" - there is a really good reason for this, she's smart - language is very powerful, it can inspire mistrust, or joy, pain or pleasure, it can motivate people to destroy one another, or to heal, to pull people out of desperate situations, or to push them over into an abyss. It can sell people crap, it can give you knowledge and protect you, or lead you to terrible pain. Mom should've also warned us to watch other people's language, because it can really lead you to bad places. Hitler motivated a whole nation to do extremely abusive things. I think the most beautiful word in the English language is Careful. To be full of care. Good parents and caretakers always use the word careful. Caretaker is another lovely word - the most important job in our country. Animal caretakers aren't paid and they usually end up on that horrible aristocratic animal hoarding show. Millions of animals are killed and suffer greatly every year, I wish we could help them and create millions of Careful Caretakers to fight it off. The elderly, overburdened helpers, stressed out heroes, the sick, the sad... - could all use some of the Careful. To teach people to care and HOW to care is all in all there is. This books helps a little in terms of that - for your loved ones as best you can, caring for yourself when everything goes bad, caring for some of those that can't care for themselves. It emphasizes giving which is the best part and why I recommend it."},{"Title":"Awaken The Giant Within (CD)","review":"Is Tony Robbins really the best person to be guiding consumers through life's major decisions? Is self-help in general cost-effective? If so, where's the proof? Which types of self-help are worthwhile--and which are outright scams? Is it possible that self-help can do more harm than good to you and the people you love? Do its basic premises make sense...or do they break down under deeper scrutiny? Is there a downside to being uplifted? What have been the wider social costs of self-help to society, industry, and American children?You won't find the answers to these important questions in books written by people named McGraw, Gray, Williamson, Robbins, Schlessinger, or any of the other established icons or rising stars of the self-help industry. (And make no mistake: Self-help is an industry--to the tune of some $8.56 billion in annual revenues.)

You don't have to have too much water. If you copy someone's body language, you gain control of their thoughts and win them over.In short, you get ready for a long-term failure.When my fiance first told me of Anthony Robbins, I was suspicious but curious. When I SAW this man's picture, I was shocked: oh dear, he looks fake and in pain! I would NOT want to meet this person. I would NOT want me or my fiance to read his books.This man's books deluded my fiance through one of the worst crises of his life, and he kept believing that not only will he recover like Mr Anthony Robbins, but that he would gain some supreme power. On top of that, he joined a millionnaire's aspirant club on Robbin's website. I would like to know how many persons from that club became millionnaires in a year? My fiance hardly bailed himself out of debt that he accrued in those times when he most believed he had unlimited power. (I also discovered that he got involved in Internet lottery/ gambling.)I have no personal vendetta with this man Robbins, but I have an aim to disclose the fraud he is. I read Unlimited Power, gifted to me by my THEN fiance (yes!). And I could see where this would lead any believer of this twisted, incoherent system.I kept my faith strong in my fiance during his hard times of financial and emotional crisis and only made the merest suggestion that these kinds of books are delusionary and feed on general human weaknesses. He slowly learnt to believe in himself, and even admitted that Mr Robbins' success is only thanks to the sale of his books and seminars to the naive.Ah but the glitzy promises of power and what-not of this man worked. Human are lazy and greedy, and after getting a new job, and having better prospects of marriage, my THEN fiance fell back into the trap of achievement and power...Today, my ex-fiance is alone and miserable because he chose to let go of one sound job, dislikes his new job (several times better than the previou), and let go of his relationships. That includes me, his parents, and his sincerest friends.Our relationship is over, not only because of reconcilable normal personal differences, but because he on the one hand believes his past and future are messed and on the other harbors 3 different delusions about success.God bless him.

If capable of being implemented, this seminal book for the scientifically oriented lay person, posits an entirely new way to look at computing and telecommunications, using current knowledge and its extensions concerning quantum physics, to outline a design for computers and communicators (teleporters?) of the future. As he states, at the present pace of computing speed development, we will be at the ultimate speed and molecular level in approximately the year 2028. Then what? Quantum computing. The book is also an intriguing teaser for venture capitalists, who may wish to get in on the bottom line in this endeavor. The rewards, if achievable, are almost boundless. It is interesting to note that a cover of the new magazine SKEPTIC pans quantum cmechanics,, by relegating its image to the label of an elixir bottle. Is this another &quot;fountain of youth?&quot; or &quot;cold fusion?&quot; The author makes a strong, if not somewhat complex case for a negative response to that question. This is a must read for cutting edge thinkers both in the realm of computing and physics and deserves a studied analysis. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ultimate Zero and One: Computing at the Quantum Frontier","review":"If you are interested in the promising field of quantum computing, this one is the primer to read. It's very well written, coherent, and goes deep enough as to challenge the reader's mind. However, don't be intimidated by the math. Even if one skips the mathematical concepts the reader will be able to understand the book and more importantly the concepts behind it. Good read, good buy."},{"Title":"Ultimate Zero and One: Computing at the Quantum Frontier","review":"This book covers some interesting material; I especially liked the chapter which discussed obtaining the results of a quantum computation without actually running the computer. The authors also give some very complete explanations of fundamental concepts such as the workings of a quantum logic gate and RSA encryption. However, their explanations are also riddled with errors and undefined notation. Often, they will spend a great deal of time explaning rather trivial things, then in the next paragraph introduce the next step with a new notation and not define it!! The result is that the calculations are often hard to follow.This book is a good read for those interesting in learning about the basics of quantum computers, but look elsewhere for a more rigourous treatment of the mathematics of quantum computing."},{"Title":"Ultimate Zero and One: Computing at the Quantum Frontier","review":"In spite of many interesting subjects described in the book, explanations about fundamentals of quantum theory seem to me quite insufficient, as like as they had been written in a hurry. I would have not understood many issues quoted in the book if I had not read before other publications about paradoxes raised by quantum physics. Another very strange choice is to place the chapter about interaction-free measurement at last, while I think this property is a necessary basic for a better understanding of properties of entanglement, above which the whole building of quantum computing relies. So, I wonder how readers without a previous knowledge of basic subjects can have dealt with the problems the book tries to explain. Surely, this book has been written for nonspecialists, as the editorial review states, but, taking into account the poor effort employed in explaining quantum theory, it could have detailed more facets about computing, and simply referencing other textbooks for physics arguments."},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater","review":"Senator Barry M. Goldwater in this book of memoirs provides us with important background information to much of what was going on in Washington in the years in which he represented Arizona in the Senate. I found especially interesting and informative his discussions of the McCarthy era, his unsuccessful race against Lyndon Johnston for President in 1964, and the fall of the Nixon presidency. Goldwater was one of the most vocal representatives of conservatism before the rise of neo-conservatism, and much conservative wisdom and common sense can be found in this book."},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater","review":"As everyone sadly knows, Barry Goldwater -- never a quitter -- failed to quit while he was ahead. No one will ever know, I guess, whether he became senile in his old age; but as time progressed, the fierce champion of the Right became more and more the gadfly, happily reveling in taking abhorrent Leftist stands and letting the media use him, laughing at him all the while.These memoirs are Goldwater before the fall, the man who gave us the modern conservative movement, still in rare form and fighting the good fight. Published in 1979, they include not only his political thoughts but his autobiography too (the book is worth buying simply for Goldwater's recounting of the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis, which have not generally been reported as this Armed Services Committee member actually witnessed them).Ronald Reagan said of this book that \\"everyone in America should read this frank accounting of backstage Washington by an honest man. With No Apologies is required reading for those who want to know the inner workings of the political world.\\" I couldn't agree more; and we may all be deeply grateful that the good Senator gave us this tome before his decline began."},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater","review":"Raised as a Democrat by a Democratic family, I happily lived under the firm belief that all Republicans and conservatives were selfish, greedy individuals who had no concern for the common good. As a child of the 60's and the Vietnam era, I held strong to my beliefs well into my early 30s.Then, in a leadership forum, I was given a copy of this book to read. In fact, a friend of mine, a man I had great respect for, made me promise that I would read it (he was battling cancer and I reluctantly agreed). I tried to race through it, but found myself going back time and time again to gain greater understanding of the mind of Goldwater. From then on, I was never the same.If you want to understand the mind of the conservative and understand what real compassion is, read this book. It's dated now, but the concepts remain the same, and you can revisit the brilliant mind of Goldwater."},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M.

Thirty years after this book was written, political and social corruption are still prevalent in our society, only the names and dated have changed. Barry Goldwater was a true poster boy of the biased media. He was a statesman that was \\"understated\\". During his career, Goldwater was portrayed as a war monger and even a lunatic, while his true greatness was overlooked and diminished.This was one of the best books that I have read in many years. one of those books that is difficult to put down.What if Goldwater defeated LBJ in the 1964 election, imagine would our great country look like now?"},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater","review":"\\"With No Apologies\\" is Barry Goldwater's 1979 autobiography, political memoir and call to action. The early parts of the book relate Goldwater's family background, youth and initial involvement in politics. Beyond his own circumstances, we get a feel for the Arizona of the first half of the Twentieth Century. With that out of the way, Goldwater moves into his analysis of issues and events which occurred during his public life. His assessments of John F. Kennedy, Nelson Rockefeller, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, among others, make for very interesting reading. They give the reader an insight into the subjects described as well as Goldwater's own world view.Goldwater's account of his own rise as a conservative spokesman and his memories of the 1964 campaign give a unique perspective into a segment of our national story. As I read about Goldwater's take on the process by which Spiro Agnew was chosen as Richard Nixon's running mate, it dawned on me that I remembered no reference to his own choice of William Miller in 1964. Sure enough, Miller's name does not appear in the index.At the end of the book, Goldwater shifts into a condemnation of the policies of the Carter administration with a call for a groundswell to unseat it. We now know the rest of that story.I appreciate this book for its tales of the somewhat old West and the critical analysis of events from about 1950 to 1979. I like a book that gives a different perspective than one would get in other works and this one surely does that. I have not read his later autobiography, \\"Goldwater\\", so maybe that would be a better place for a reader to start, but I have to think that \\"With No Apologies\\" maintains a role for its snapshot of the state of a mind and memory."},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M.

Goldwater","review":"Barry Goldwater (1909-1998) mixes politics and autobiographical detail in this book from the late 1970's. Goldwater describes his Jewish grandfather wandering the barren west (Barry was raised Episcopalian), the family department store in Phoenix, and his military service as a pilot during World War II. Readers see how Goldwater became a national figure with his upset 1952 win over Senate Majority leader Ernest McFarland. Readers also learn his views on various national figures (including his buddy John F. Kennedy), and his distaste for big government inefficiency and bureaucratic waste. Of course, there was his disastrous 1964 Presidential bid, when this charming man frightened many (including some Republicans) with foolish words on extremism and nuclear weapons. Ironically, this book arrived just before Ronald Reagan was elected President, and as the GOP was turning away from moderates and even libertarian-style conservatives like Goldwater. Perhaps that explains Goldwater's 1980's criticism of religious conservatism and Jerry Falwell, plus his support for abortion and (later) gays in the military.The book is informative but doesn't quite connect; perhaps that's why at this writing it has received so few reviews from conservatives (which I am not), liberals, and other readers."},{"Title":"With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M.

She lives in Northern California, but was born in Seattle. She studied Architecture at the University of Washington and married a Navy man.Burrywood, Washington is a small town with lots of characters living in it. Not all of them are what would be referred to as upstanding citizens. Take Tolly, for instance. He used to be a great principal, but succumbed to the evils of drink. Then there is the mayor, Neal Thomas. No one likes him, and he is the first murder victim. His wife Charlotte isn't too friendly either...she runs the drugstore and is a nurse, which most people don't know. Rose lives in a huge mansion her father won in a poker game. Her brother, Sam, shows up to help her sell its contents...he is the perennial rolling stone. Then there is Reverend Amos...a man in his 80's who wanders around town. His son is the Police Chief. It takes the town newspaper owner, Diana, and her sidekick, restaurateur Winona, to sort things out when dead bodies start appearing:&quot;Still to search were Neal's desk and the file drawers and cabinet behind it. Big, big job. It exhausted me to think about it. I pulled the desk chair out, intending to sit and think things over. Instead I found myself staring at a green packet sticking out of the crevice between the back of the seat and the cushion. It was money, all neatly done up with a rubber band.&quot;Lana Waite writes a terrifically funky and thoroughly non-violent mystery where character is the driving force. Her townspeople could be characters in a play...they are well-defined and each have their role to play. Diana and Winona are delightfully wise middle-aged women who don't stand for any nonsense and cut to the heart of the other characters' foibles. Diana is the focal point of the book, as she runs the town newspaper. Although she is a down-to-earth character, she does get rattled enough to take action and kick the other characters out of their neuroses.Buried in Burrywood is a charming story that is about what people are really like. Sweetness comes in the form of ultimate acceptance of their condition. It is when these characters see themselves as they are that they are able to overcome the blocks that have been keeping them from self-acceptance to become contributing members of their little town.

Nurtured by a loving family, young Jimmy couldn't imagine that life anywhere other than his home in a remote area west of Savannah could be as good or as interesting for a boy. It's a land of big and dangerous snakes, nasty spiders, chiggers, ticks and other forms of life that many people would find forbidding. Not so young Jimmy. His grandfather, Mr. Jim, taught him to carry a snake stick and his father, a former cavalry officer called Mr. Fet, taught him about horses and a number of other lessons of value to any youngster. His Aunt Augusta taught him many things, some of which he felt cramped the style of a growing boy, and a few uncles and unusual characters from the neighborhood imparted valuable information about life that was important in the flatwood country of Georgia or just about anywhere else. Jim Elders expresses a number of heartfelt convictions that make interesting reading. He comments, too, on the evolving face of the countryside as the freeways were built and the bulldozers changed the landscape from a habitat for wildlife to an area of housing developments and shopping centers. That's a story that has been repeated in much of the country, a sad story told very well by Jim Elders.

So many things that you will marvel at that James remembers to include in his memoir of a young lad and young adult in the Georgia Pines.There are lines James uses in two places that really left me laughing when he'd write a familiar line and say \\"I always wanted to write that.\\" This book is a book that should fill the school libraries and is a treasure to share with one's family. Any Southern born and Southern raised person will want to own this wonderful book.I highly recommend it to anyone._________________"},{"Title":"Environmental Chemistry","review":"I am also a chemistry student and I found the book to be rather easy, but that is because the text is very clearly written with good presentation and concise wording.

I usually don't read the textbooks for my classes after the first week of school, but I find myself still reading this one for fun a year later. It's just chemistry applied in interesting ways...for example, you learn how to determine the concentration of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons formed when different meats are smoked. Or the variety of chemicals in cigarette smoke. The book seems to be biased towards organic chemistry in parts, but it's basic o-chem. You'll also learn a lot about topics ranging from combustive rivers (yeah, you read that right), to catalytic destruction of the Ozone layer.

If you are looking for a deep, scholarly tome on the history of Ireland, buy something else. If, however, you are planning on a trip to Ireland and want some basics with regard to the culture and politics of IE, give this a read. I read this along with the historical-fiction novel, \\"Trinity\\" to prepare for my trip and felt the balance between the two was a nice way to learn the highlights of Irish history."},{"Title":"A concise history of Ireland.","review":"A mixed bag, this. Good for a brief exposure to some of the more renowned moments and movements in Irish history, but hard to follow at many spots. The early chapters seem to have been written by a different hand than the later. The language of the earlier ones is hard to follow and no coherent picture formed in my mind about that time. The later ones are easier because they're more \\"newsy\\" in style. You're only going to get the highlights of the times (up until mid-1984) and even those are at times disjointed, or strung together with facts the reader is presumed to already be familiar with.I borrowed this from the library. I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"A concise history of Ireland.","review":"This is truly one of the most lacking of the general histories of Ireland available on the market. Conor Cruise O'Brien and Maire O'Brien provide a rather pourous account of the history of Ireland and manage to not quite even skim the surface. Leaving out many of the events that would embarass the author or not promote his own political agenda, this book is at best a waste of time. There are many, many better accounts available."},{"Title":"Lost Cities","review":"This book is a great overview of lost cities without getting too deep into any one culture. It covers Macchu Pichu and Chichen Itza of course, but it also cover a few in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the Middle East. The regions it seems to have left out is the Far East and Pacific countries, which is a shame as the book is only 224 pages. It could easily have been expanded to 300 pages and maintained my interest. Each culture only covers 30 pages at most so if you're familiar with the story you can quickly skip to the next section. The book contains approximately 10 pages of black and white pictures and etchings as well."},{"Title":"Lost Cities","review":"This book is meant to \\"entertain\\" not to instruct, as the author clearly states in his introduction. You will find the story of how several lost cities were found mostly by amateur archeologists (government officials, diplomatics and even businessman that had read romantic or epic stories of lost cities and empires), more guided by passion than by deep knowledge of archeological techniques. This lack of knowledge made the findings harder to understand or reconstruct and some sites might even have been damaged by their digging methods, but their passion, perseverance and sometimes even ingenuity made the findings possible.The narratives are not very thorough (each lost city is covered in one - maximum two chapters), but the author always refers to what he considers to be the best source for each lost city, sometimes even a first hand account of the discoveries. I liked other books of the author a lot better likeThe Bull Of MinosandLand of the Pharaohs (Major Cultures of the World Series). In these books his goal was to instruct and by going deeper into the subject he achieves to entertain better, otherwise it's just like: \\"Hey, did you know about this lost city? Here some brief facts and a source where you can find a good narrative...\\".I liked the sections on Ceylon and Machu Picchu the best, since I did not know much about how they were found, the chapter on Pompeii is also quite good. In general terms the book is good but not overwhelming, you can probably find better summaries of \\"lost cities\\", wheraeas his \\"Bull of Minos\\" is probably one of the best accounts you will find of the discovery of Crete and the search for \\"Troy\\" by Schliemann; although almost out of print, it's worth looking for it. So having read his better books I was kind of disappointed by the lack of depth of this one, however, I will still give one or two of his other books a try."},{"Title":"Religion in America","review":"For an undergraduate course in American Religious history and experience I am teaching, I use a derivative of this book (the publishers, Pearson, will customise texts for particular schools). However, the basic shell remains the same, as well as the vast majority of the content with the text one would purchase here.According to authors Corrigan and Hudson, \`the story of religion in America is the story of many religions, some claiming large memberships, some numbering only a few followers.' It involves issues of geography, ethnography, and pluralism both comfortable and conflicting. This continues into the present time, as issues of nationalism and globalism enter into relationship with the continuing diversity of religious identity and expression in the United States.The text begins with colonial times, not simply with the various settlements in the thirteen colonies, but also in the Spanish and French arrivals dating back to 1492. It also discusses in the opening chapter the worldview of the native peoples, which is not a monolithic or unitary thing, but rather a wide range of viewpoints, practices and organisational elements perhaps outnumbering the variety within Christianity today.The authors draw in brief discussions of the situation in European Catholicism and Protestantism as they introduce the various peoples who arrive in the Americas, as their understanding and reaction to the European versions play a pivotal role in how they attempt to constitute themselves in the Western hemisphere. The various elements within English-speaking and Continental Protestantism are covered with good definition for an introductory survey.The text continues with a discussion of the Great Awakening and its influence on the increasingly independent colonies of North America, and how it contributed to the sense of communal identity and separateness that led to distinct denominationalism. The authors also look at the role of religion in politics at the time of the American Revolution as well as the attitudes of different churches toward independence. Included here is a brief discussion of the situation with regard to the unwilling immigrants who brought aspects of their own religious traditions from Africa.The second section surveys the new nation as it grows and spreads from east to west, including a strengthening and realignment of denominations, with Protestant Christian dominance more or less solidified by the Second Awakening. The authors also discuss the situation of Jewish communities now forming in America, various Utopian movements, social movements such as Abolitionism, and various new developments in the American religious landscape (Mormonism, Spiritualism, etc.).The period from the Civil War to the first world war is covered in the third section. This looks at issues dealing with north/south splits and reunifications due to the Civil War, the impact of freedom for African Americans on religious life in America, the impact of modern intellectual movements on religious thinking, and issues of the increasing urban character of the United States. Various movements here include the idea of the Social Gospel, women's issues, and missionary work both at home and abroad.The final section looks at the twentieth century from the first world war forward. Protestantism and Catholicism underwent major changes both domestically and worldwide, and many smaller groups began to grow in importance, such as Judaism and Eastern Orthodoxy (and, as the century drew to a close, other world religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam began to have a presence in the religious fabric of America).This is a relatively brief survey for such a vast topic, considering that so many Americans take religion seriously, even if not adhering to particular churches or other institutions. Even so, the numbers of people who do not identity themselves as Christian or even as religious has grown tremendously in the last decade of the twentieth century. Still, this has not lessened the increasing diversity of religious expression. \`Religious diversity in America has created an environment hospitable to popular religion. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Native America religions, and other ancient traditions are visible in as assortment of American contexts and locales. Alongside them are the many younger religions that either were born on American soil or were brought here by immigrants.'The book includes a very useful index and a section of suggested readings, which could be fleshed out a bit more. There are footnotes rather than endnotes, which is a good thing, particularly given that the number of footnotes is adequate for scholarly purposes but not overbearing for the general and typical undergraduate reader. There is a small but reasonable number of maps, photographs, and other images throughout the text. The narrative itself is accessible, fairly engaging and helpful for anyone interested in the history of religion in America."},{"Title":"Religion in America","review":"As a person who has used the 6th edition for years and moved to others that were more updated, I found this edition to be a step up.

I remember it as one of my childhood favorites, it still makes me laugh today as an adult and I have yet to meet one single kid who doesn't get a kick out of this book! Steig writes some absolutely delightful pieces of children's literature but this short little story is hands down still his best work. It's about as dark as a traditional fairy tale (think little red riding hood) so you might want to exercise caution when reading to very sensitive kids but, beyond that, I can't think of a thing to say against it."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I remember loving this book as a child, and now that I have a child, I had to get it.

I think one of the all time greatest two pages of childrens picture books is here when the main character leans back into flowers and says to herself \\"I love everything\\". That is a message and sentiment that should be remembered everyday.Steig has so many rich values in his books that he is being taught in my college as a surpreme storyteller with wonderful messages for kids. He writes in a simple clean way while incorporating rich lessons that children may learn from subconsiously. He is a wonderful writer. This is a wonderful story, as are all his works."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"This book horrified me. Maybe it's no worse than Hansel and Gretel, but between the awful attempted robbery, the abduction and the graphic description of the fox planning to cook and eat the sweet heroine --- YIKES.

If you're a Steig fan, be sure to look this one over and decide for yourself if it's right for your child prior to buying it."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Book was received in expected condition as agreed upon. All is good. :-)"},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"My 3 year old is fascinated by the concept that we all have bones in our bodies, so I hastily selected this book right before Christmas without really reading it. Big mistake! The plot heavily features armed robbery, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and intent to murder the main character. A little heavy for her, in my opinion. She seemed to take it in stride, but I was apalled.Also, since my main reason for choosing this book was in response to my daughter's interest in bones as part of our anatomy, I was disappointed that there is no explanation where the bone in this story comes from...is it a human bone or an animal's bone? How did it come to be able to talk? And why is this magic object a bone and not an amazing rock or feather or something else?On the other hand, the illustrations are lovely and the story is interesting, though odd, for older children."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Steig is a top illustrator and kid's author. Raise your kids right with quality stuff. This is a start"},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"This book's central drama echoes the plotline of Beatrice Potter's &quot;Jenima Puddle-Duck.&quot; Of course, the characters of the wily fox and the babe in the woods are archetypes, but compare the two texts side-by-side (Potter's tale can be found online). However, it would be a big stretch to say Steig is &quot;copying&quot; in any way because his work has a charm and originality all its own. Anybody else read both texts recently and have an opinion on this observation?"},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I read this book to my 5 year old daughter last night and it was too traumatic for both of us. When the masked bandits \\"hold a gun to her head\\" and the later as she cries and says \\"I don't want to die\\", it is just too much graphic detail. If any kid were to write something like that, they'd probably undergo psychiatric evaluation. I don't even give it one star - stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"My grandchildren age 5 and 3 cried when they read this book and wanted me to take it back and tell the man it is very, very scary...they have continued to go in detail about how awful and frightening this experience has been...I don't recommend this read..."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I whole heartedly agreed with the reviewer who said \\"not for young children\\". I bought this story unpreviewed thinking it sounded interesting. Thank goodness I did preview it before I read it to my kids as I am sure I'd have two very upset little ones!! The image of the robbers putting a gun to the pig's head!! What in the world was this author & illustrator thinking???!! And it gets more serious when it really looks like the pig will lose her life to the wolf who wants to eat her. I could never imagine throwing a book away until I came acorss this one. There is no moral or lesson at all in this story, though you'd think there would be one. The bone doesn't know it's magical until the very last minute when the wolf, (who wasn't scared off by the bone's put-on scary voice as the robbers were) is about to cook her up for dinner. The bone speaks some magical words & saves the pig, but that's the end. The pig goes home & tells her parents who don't beleive her. The pig keeps the bone for the rest of her life next to her bed. Reading Rainbow should get a demerit for having this book associated with them and I can't see what Caldecott was thinking about this book either. I can't imagine what age this would be for or good for. Ugh. Awful. The worst book (story) I've ever come across."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"This is the worst children's book I've ever read. I am a teacher and have quite a range of knowledge of children's books. There is no moral to this story. The story starts out very pleasant and then there are 3 robbers with knives and guns. As if that isn't bad enough, they even hold the gun to Pearl's head!! There are 3 different scenes with them ~ it doesn't make sense. Then a Fox comes along and leads her to an abandoned house - With beer bottles on the front lawn!! It is truly an awful book. I teach High School English 3 and discussed the book with my students, some of whom are parents ~ they even agreed that it's not a book for children!!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I checked this book out for my five year-old thinking it was a good read because it is a Caldecott Honor award winner. It started out as a beautiful and innocent child's book but turned into a frightening story. Nothing like Grimm, this book has no redeeming moral in the end. The gun and knife gang is too real and scary as it is. The slick fox brings up too many images of kidnappers/murderers that you read about in the papers these days. I found myself feeling very uncomfortable while reading this story, imagine what is going on in the mind of an impressionable youngster! Who cares what happens in the end!!! This is not the kind of story you want to send your kid to bed with. I asked my daughter what she thought about this book and she said it was too violent. I have no idea what the ALA was thinking when they honored this book!The moral of this story is don't trust a medal! And, preview your children's books for appropriateness."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Before talking generally about the book, let me share my reaction that children who are sensitive and easily develop fears may find this book to be too much for them. Read this book first before reading it to your child. The sections in question have robbers threatening to kill Pearl the Pig and a fox planning to do the same thing prior to eating Pearl. I found both situations a little rougher on the emotions than the standard Little Red Riding Hood fare in this regard.This story was a Caldecott Honor book in 1977 as one of the best illustrated children's stories of that year. The book has many outstanding features. First, the watercolors and ink outlines nicely convey bright, spring colors and create a light mood. Second, the story has a very funny plot device in having a major character be a talking bone. Third, the plot reversals are quite sudden, dramatic, and emotionally laden. This book will make quite an impression on its readers. Fourth, the book raises very nice questions about all kinds of human relations that will keep you and your child talking for years.Pearl the Pig dawdled in town after school. Her purpose was to watch the grownups doing their work, in order to think about what she might do when she grew up. She watched street cleaners, bakers, and &quot;old guffers&quot; pitching horseshoes.Then she headed home through the forest. Once there, &quot;she could almost feel herself changing into a flower&quot; as she looked at the beautiful scene around her.&quot;I hear something.&quot;&quot;So do I,&quot; a voice answered. &quot;I'm the bone in the violets near the tree by the rock on your right.&quot;&quot;You talk?&quot;&quot;In any language . . . .&quot; &quot;And I can imitate any sound there is.&quot;&quot;How?&quot;&quot;I don't know. I didn't make the world.&quot;The bone reports that it fell out of a witch's basket in August. The bone didn't want to return. &quot;I'd be happier with someone young and lively like you.&quot;From out of nowhere, three armed highway robbers wearing masks rushed them, and threatened to shoot Pearl. The bone hissed like a snake and roared like a lion in her purse, and the robbers bolted.Next a fox grabbed her. &quot;You will be my main course tonight.&quot; The bone claimed to be a ravenous crocodile, but the fox was not fooled. The fox found the bone and put it in his pocket.Just when the fox is about to do away with Pearl, the bone starts in incantation. The fox starts shrinking! Pearl is saved.&quot;I didn't know you could do magic!&quot;&quot;Neither did I.&quot; The words &quot;just came to me.&quot;They went home and told Pearl's distraught parents about their adventures. The bone stayed and became part of the family. The bone rested in an honored place on a silver tray on the mantlepiece, except at night. Then, the Pearl took the bone to bed, and they talked and talked. They also sang.The bone always kept the house full of music and sounds, even when the family didn't want them.As you can see, without the extreme threats of violence, this is a very funny and original story. So if your child likes things a little on the scary side, this will be a five star book. If you child is timid on those issues, avoid this book until that changes. I averaged that perception out to four stars, assuming that most children around 6 could handle the threatened violence and the abductions well as fantasy.The benefit, of course, of a story like this one is to open up the subject of what your child should be doing when alone, when in the presence of strangers alone, and how to handle the kind of events that parents don't like to even think about happening. A good way to begin this discussion is to ask your child what Pearl should have done differently. What could the bone have done differently? If the bone were another child, what should the other child have done? And so forth. You get the idea.Would you like to have a talking bone as a friend? Personally, I'd like to find out more about what kind of music the bone likes to make first.What would you like to do when you grow up?Travel to the limits of imagination to find the potential for good in the world around us!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Why hello book of my youth! And may I say, how pleasant it is to read you once again. I know it's been at least 20 years since I was but a wee tot on my mother's knee. She would read \\"The Amazing Bone\\" to me time and time again, and I really did find it a delightful story. Now, years and years later, I read it again. There's something about a good Steig book. And to me, this is the most evocative of his stories. Oh, there are people firmly devoted to \\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\". And I daresay \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Doctor De Soto\\" have their fans as well. But give me \\"The Amazing Bone\\" over these trifles any day. It's a warm ribald thoroughly satisfying tale of a young pig, a talking bone, and the troubles that ensue.Pearl is a sweet young pig winding her way home one day. Enjoying the people around her, the clean crisp air, and the softness of the flowered glens, Pearl is a bit like Little Red Riding Hood. She is in no particular hurry to get home. When Pearl stumbles across a magical talking bone, she is delighted. The bone too is quite happy and the two make a delicious pair. When robbers (frightfully dressed in scary masks and carrying guns & knives) attempt to rob little Pearl, the bone successfully drives the bandits off with scary sounds. Some parents find this an inappropriate portion of the tale and will make a very big deal about it. Honestly? It's just a little too weird to seriously freak out a child. I daresay parents are the ones frightened by this part of the book. Not kiddies. Continuing in the story a dapper fox is less gullible than the silly robbers. When he decides to make Pearl his meal, the bone's cries are in vain. It is only through a series of fortunate turns of fate that Pearl and her bone may return safe and sound to her home and her parents.Don't get me wrong. The story is doggone bizarre. One of Steig's weirdest by far. Steig was a fan of the small common object (bone, pebble, etc.) containing great grandiose powers. His stories often focus on the little fellow outwitting the big (sometimes literally). And foxes were his favorite villains. Often elegantly dressed, they have the capacity for pity. They just ignore it. This particular story is especially disturbing because of the nature of Pearl's abduction. The fox forces her into his abandoned shack, leaving her cowering on the floor of a room. Want to drill into your children the horrors of strangers and the dangers of going anywhere with them? I can't think of a better method of getting this point home (though, admittedly, I don't remember getting that message when I myself read this story as a child). Though the book certainly contains creepy possibilities, the story is a good one. You're safe with Steig. And just a word on the beauty of his illustrations. Though Steig obviously preferred to grow messier and squigglier in his creations as he aged, no scene in children's picture books is more perfectly pastoral than the shot of Pearl reclining amongst the flowering trees and fields. All in all, a great story couched in a great book."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I bought this book based on the fact it was a Caldecott Honorable Mention and based on the reviews. I have to say my son loved the book until we got to the part where robbers in Halloween masks jump out of the bushes and put a gun to Pearl's head. Hello? You reviewers out there. My son (3, almost 4) was shocked. He asked a zillion questions about the robbers. Weren't they bad? Did they hurt Pearl? Why (how come) they were robbing her? The next day the questions continued. I bought 10 Caldecott books and we were reading the books right out of the box and I failed to preview the story. Big mistake. This book is charming and wonderful except for the robbery scene which is graphic and extremely disturbing. That scene also seems out of place. In my opinion, it does not belong in a children's book. Parents of young children--beware of this book. Adults, enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I almost didn't buy this book after reading some of the reviews here. Of particular concern was the gun scene. It gets a lot of press here. I'm not sure why really. More explicit gun scenes can be found in Animalia. I guess my take is this: If a book is glorifying guns, encouraging children to use them as toys, and you happen to be a non-gun-owning hippie like me, you'd avoid that kind of book. But this book isn't doing that. It's bad guys with guns. Guns that really are an aside from the plot. They aren't even that scary either. Hmph... Big deal. Turns out the scariest part of this book is fearing for poor Pearl's life when she's in the the fox's house. At least it had me on the edge of my seat. All turns out well in the end.My daughter loved this book too, and was ready for the second read just an hour later. She didn't seem troubled by the twists this tale takes. I think she knows it's just a story. She went to sleep without a hitch tonight. I guess she's just not scared. Except for the fear of the air conditioner vents and the flashing alien lights inside them. Yep. And she didn't even read that in a book. Come to think of it, we don't have any children's books about aliens or air conditioner vents. Hmm...I don't think I'd define this book as being bizarre. I'm a little disappointed really. I was expecting something far more... well... bizarre. Thinking alien lights are in the air conditioner vents is bizarre. Maurice Sendak's \\"In the Night Kitchen\\" is bizarre. I mean a talking bone isn't much less believable than a pebble that grants wishes, right? Bad things happen to good pigs? Not bizarre. Ironic statements? Wily foxes? So not bizarre.If you're a fan of Steig, this story is a nice add to the collection.If your child is already scared of animals wearing Halloween masks and brandishing pistols and/or sinister foxes who confess they aren't ashamed for being carnivores because if foxes aren't supposed to eat pigs then why are pigs made of meat (even nice pigs), no need to heighten their fear.This is a fairy tale. It isn't any scarier than a Grimm's tale, and probably less than most. If it provokes conversation with your children, talk, and pat yourself on the back for reading them a book that made 'em think, rather than just handing them a remote control."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Our two children, ages 3 and 6-1/2, absolutely LOVE this story, and we love reading it to them, as it is a very fun book to read aloud. I suppose it contains some edgy elements for a children's book: violence is threatened several times, and Pearl (the darling protagonist/pig) is almost eaten by a fox -- but is this any more violent than, say, The Three Little Pigs? As William Steig says several times in this beautiful, enjoyable tale, \\"I didn't make the world.\\" That being said, I suppose this story isn't for everyone, and I wouldn't recommend it for children who are especially young or easily scared, but having read a TON of children's book over the last six years, this is one of the few for which I've been moved to write a recommendation. Honestly, just hearing my kids running around exclaiming \\"Have you no shame, Sir?!\\" to each other (and everyone else) and then bursting into giggles was worth any talk explaining why foxes want to eat pigs. I'd give it six stars if I could, but then, I didn't make the world."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"These words are spoken by a fox, one of the villains of this book, to a talking bone, one of the heroes. The bone is not inanimate - it is a sentient creature with feelings and a sweet disposition.There is no doubt that Steig is brilliant, but in The Amazing Bone he seems to have lost his bearings. How can a book purportedly written for children include a character that takes pleasure from inflicting pain, and describes it in this graphic way?The fox also menaces Pearl, a darling piglet who is the other protagonist of the book. Her trouble starts, as it might for any child, as follows: \\"It was a brilliant day, and instead of going straight home from school, Pearl dawdled\\".As she slowly makes her way home through idyllic scenery, Pearl happens upon the talking bone. \\"'May I take you home with me, wonderful bone?' Pearl asked\\".But the happy scene is soon interrupted by three masked robbers who put a gun to the head of the innocent child. With the help of the bone Pearl escapes, only to fall into the clutches of the even more sinister fox. The shocking threat of torture follows as the valiant bone tries to rescue its new friend for a second time.\\"When they arrived at the fox's hideaway, he shoved Pearl into and empty room and locked the door\\". While there are many such scenes in the Little Red Riding Hood genre of fairy tale, there is something particularly violent and dark in Stieg's portrayal. The image of Pearl cowering on the floor of the locked room awaiting her fate is disturbing to the extreme.Notwithstanding a happy ending it's clear that this book can't be recommended for children, and that it isn't intended for adults. This being the case it is surprising that in 1977 it was recognized by the American Library Association as a Caldecott Honor Book. Certainly Steig's artful and evocative illustrations are remarkable, but should not have been sufficient, in and of themselves, for the conferring of this prestigious award."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I love this book and my 3 year old adores it. It's my new favorite.I have to say that these reviews about howw \\"scary\\" the book is are ridicylous. Have you never read a fairy tale? I didn't find this charming tale any more jarring than Hansel anf Gretel or the 3 Little Pigs or Little Red Riding Hood or Bambi."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Is there a more charming book than this? A very dear friend was in the hospital and, in addition to feeling ill, was in a very crabby mood, yelling at doctors and technicians whenever they approached. I brought this book to read to him because I thought it might cheer him up. After I finished, he thanked me and also called me later at home to thank me anew for bringing such a charming book into his life because it honestly did make him feel better. Pearl and her loyal new best friend, the bone, are wonderful and any adult or child will find it to be a refreshingly lovely treat."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Steig is my favorite children's book author and The Amazing Bone my favorite of his books. I love the characters and the sense of evil conquered by the lovely piggirl. His depiction of spring is wonderful, like a breath of fresh air. Steig transports the reader with his sweet magic, but always maintains a balance with his evil characters lurking just around the corner. Read all of his stuff, you'll truly be a better person for it."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"I'm shocked by all the negative reviews. If your child is disturbed by this, they may be too young for it. They would also be too young for \\"Red Riding Hood\\", \\"Snow White\\", the \\"Three Little Pigs\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"The Lion King\\" and anything by Beatrix Potter.If you fear gun-toting robbers far more than being eaten alive or slaughtered, you may dislike this book more than you dislike fairytales. Fairy-tales usually feature child-abuse, parents dying, family abandonment and the fear of characters being killed. Sometimes family members are eaten (Red Riding Hood's grandmother), parents die (the Lion King and Cinderella) and step-mothers abuse and even trying to kill their step children (Snow White and Cinderella).This book is relatively mild in comparison. It is so sophisticated though, the fox at one point apologizes to Pearl, saying it is just his nature, he is a fox. It's a great lesson in the complex truth that animals eat other animals, not because they're villains, but because it is their natural food source. And while we of course root for Pearl the pig, you can't help but understand the carnivorous fox.Definitely, if the book seems scary to you, don't read it to your kid. You might pass on your horror to your child. My mom was crazy about this book and read it to me, handing down her great affection for \\"The Amazing Bone.\\" I've read it to children as young as three who begged for it to be read to them every night.While some reviewers went so far as to term this book \\"child abuse\\", I think it does far greater damage to your child to delude them into thinking there is nothing to fear in the world, then letting them discover it alone, never to recover from the disillusionment. If your child first hears about death when a grandparent dies, or doesn't realize that there are bad people in the world until they encounter one, they are more likely to be scarred by it. Fairytales are a safe environment to encounter very scary things. In your lap, children feel safe while watching good characters be threatened by awful people and experiences and still triumph and find happiness. They teach resilience, bravery and the importance of being one of the good guys. They teach children that awful things may happen in life, but that is not the end of the story. If you stick to the \\"How do I love You\\" \\"Counting Kisses\\" \\"Endless Hugs\\" \\"You're SOOO Special\\" books, and endlessly tell them that they are loved and perfect, they will never wonder why you feel the need to continually reassure them of that. Never."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"This book shocked me, and I am NOT an over-reactive type of parent. My daughter picked this up in a waiting room and we were reading happily together. I couldn't believe it when our heroine suddenly had a gun to her head!! And abducted and taken to an abandoned house where she is left in a room alone to ponder an imminent death? Yeah, of course she escapes. But then she merely goes home where the entire incident is glossed over. It was the strangest children's book I have ever seen and certainly the most unpleasant."},{"Title":"The Amazing Bone","review":"Excellent service. No complaints. Product looks great!

The women characters in this book, in particular, are complex and interesting. Mr. Farrington makes neither devils nor angels of these characters, but shows them as real people in how they chose to live their lives--just as you think one character is the devil incarnate, Mr. Farrington brings out a side to them that is sympathetic and touching. Yet, later in the story, they are the very devil again.A must read for all English history buffs, if it can be found."},{"Title":"Breath of Kings","review":"I have always felt that the middle ages have glossed over and romanced to much through fairy tales and such. But this book breaks that sterotype and shows the brutality and gruesomeness of what life might have been like back then. Everything about the book was facinating and real. The characters complex and alive, the culture harsh and tramatic, the plots were facinating and deep. It's also impossible to put down. I made a challenge to a friend of mine, who happens to hate reading. I said, \\"read the first chapter of this book, and then get rid of it forever.\\" After reading just the first chapter, my friend decided he must read the entire thing, and he did. This is a long book, if just one chapter conviced a non- reader to read a 700+ page novel, it is amazing. I extend this challenge to anyone else out there, read just the first chapter, and see if you can put it down. If Mr. farrington ever writes anything else, I will be sure to read it asap."},{"Title":"Breath of Kings","review":"This was certainly a hard book to find! If you can get a copy, it will be well worth your while. I really enjoyed the characterization of Cnut the Great, as well as that of Earl Godwin, Queen Emma, Lady Estrid, Lady Gytha and the rest. This novel is about 11th century England. It gives a lot of details without ever getting boring. Do try to find it! If you like this time period, also try to find \\"The Hollow Crown\\" by Helen Hollick, \\"Gildenford\\" by Valerie Anand, \\"Lord of Sunset\\" by Godwin Parke, and \\"The Golden Warrior\\" by Hope Muntz."},{"Title":"Breath of Kings","review":"Wow - this was a good book. I have read extensively on the Battle of Hastings, King Harold II, Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. The part of the story leading up to those memorable figures, was what I lacked. Farrington has told that tale through primarily the eyes of Emma of Normandy, but also Earl Godwin, King Cnute, Edward and his siblings as children, and the rest of those who lived in the years just prior to the historical turning point of 1066. Farrington was thorough yet the book flowed and I never felt that he was \\"stretching\\" the story to fill pages. The characters were all very well developed and I found his interpretations of them similar to other tidbits of info I had seen yet at the same time unique in his descriptions. Emma begins the story as a rather sad, misunderstood woman in an incredibly unhappy marriage to Ethelred. She moves through the years as a powerful, intellegent woman at a time when women were to be subservient. Her power lies in her beauty, her family connections to Normandy and her ability to bear children - heirs to first Ethelred and then to Cnute. Through this one outlet of \\"power\\" however, she is seen by her contemporaries as a meddling, manipulative whore. She despises her children by Ethelred which thus shapes their personalities and their future relationships with the mother who never loves and then abandons them. Godwin appears as the supporter of King Cnute's claim following Ethelred's death and his character develops as the \\"man behind the throne\\" ambitious and cunning, yet keenly aware of his place in society. He marries well and fathers a large family including Edith (wife of Edward the Confessor) and Harold (future king), yet most of his time is spent trying to secure the empire into a peaceful reign. Edith has a part in the story as she grows up to become Edward's wife and is torn between her devotion to God, husband and father. However, when it comes to the actual turn of power from the supposedly promised heir William of Normandy to Harold - little is said. The story develops and occurs and then the better known history simply takes over as this book ends. I was a little unhappy with the character of Edward. He is described as an albino who loves his mother unconditionally despite her blatant hatred of him and her many attempts to have him killed. Where I found the story spinning off into a bit too much fantasy was the addition of Edward's ability to heal the sick and crippled. It makes the reader see Edward as a truly saintly figure who was simply misunderstood though loved and adored by those who had witnessed his miracle working. I rather believe that Edward was truly a very confused person having suffered a lifetime of psychological damage from his mother, the death of his brother, and society's reaction to his albinoism. He likely turned to God as a solice and became very pious as a result - not born with some mystical ability to heal and seizurs that allowed him to \\"see God\\". Beyond that, I found the rest of the book, reasonably historically acurate for a work of fiction. It was fun to read, very enjoyable and again it offered a look at the set up for the events of 1066."},{"Title":"Breath of Kings","review":"This novel took a different approach with the whole Danish Conquest of England. The characters were not stereotypical, but they were outlandish. Farrington shed light on characters like Ulf and Estrith, who are usually treated marginally. The most fascinating characters, of course, were Cnut, Emma, and Godwin."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I've been a struggling small business owner (some 32 to 38 employees, depending upon the season) thinking my problem was either that I was undercapitalized or that I had hired the wrong people. Raving Fans was a wake up call. The problem was I wasn't creating raving fans. I was satisfied if my customers were satisfied, but I learned in this book that service is so bad that customers expectations are low. It's easy to satisfy low expectations and it doesn't mean very much. You have to create raving fans. Customers who tell others how wonderful you are. Today everyone in my company is focused on customers. Focused on creating stories our customers can tell others. Creating those magic moments the book calls giving symbolic hugs. Best of all Raving Fans gave me the road map to do it, all wrapped up in three easy lessons. This book may be simple, but it is also profound and by far the best customer service book I've ever read, and I guess the best business book too. I'd be out of business today if I hadn't adopted the strategy of creating raving fans and then getting everyone in the company to do the same. The result is we've stopped buring our customer list every six months. We're retaining old customers, adding new ones and sales are way up. Today Raving Fans is required reading for every new hire. Thanks Amazon for this opportunity to write this review. You're the best.

I and my staff have to deliver exceptional service if I expect them to come back and refer their friends and family to me. The normal dental experience in this world is &quot;well, he didn't hurt me too much.&quot; I want people to rave about their dental visits, not just tell the usual &quot;horror stories&quot;! This book has been used in my office as a reading assignment and the subject of staff meetings, in an attempt to comunicate to my staff and have them deliver service that exceeds the patient's expectations. The simple style it's told in really keeps their attention, since most people will not read the more detailed and lengthy books on the market that are similar in substance. Highly recommended for any business person--large or small!"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Raving Fans is a decent business text and a nice break from some of the more academic titles out there. Like most Ken Blanchard titles, the book is a very easy and quick read. Its value for the time invested is therefore good (but not great).The most important teaching from this book was that you can't settle for simply &quot;satisfied&quot; customers. Service expectations are often so low that people claim to be satisfied when indeed they are not. This leaves you vulnerable to any competitor that merely raises the bar on service. This is not rocket science. Like the rest of the book, the advice given is practical albeit simplistic.Raving Fans suffers from a lack of real-world examples. The fictional stories are handy for getting one to think about creative service ideas. Unfortunately, there is a lack of supporting details to show how these ideas translate to profitability. You can't grab onto these ideas and say to a doubting associate; &quot;Of course this can work. This is just how (insert name of real business here) did it!&quot;If you don't have much time to read about customer service ideas, I would pass on this book and go directly to Carl Sewell's book &quot;Customers for Life&quot;. Sewell owns a real business and discusses the real-world issues of increasing customer service levels including compensation incentives, costs, service abuses and bottom line results. I felt that Sewell's book was a much better value for the time invested."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Kenneth Blanchard continues his trend of writing easy-to-read books with BIG ideas for making your business better. Raving Fans is a book of stories relating how fictional companies have created an environment of delivering awesome customer service. A guy that has just been put in a managment position requiring a turnaround goes on a fictional trip with his &quot;angel&quot; to visit businesses that have figured out their vision and their system to deliver customer service extraordinary. Based on three simple principles (Decide, Discover, Deliver), each company has created a group of Raving Fans (not just customers, but fans) who wouldn't consider shopping anywhere else for what one of these companies offers. Within each story is other nuggets of common sense and good ideas that can be implemented in any company that has customers and wants to create fans. We required our store managers to read the book and each created a list ranging from 20-40 points that they can put into effect at their stores to improve customer service. This is a simple, must-read for every business owner and manager."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Ken Blanchard's books were recommended to me by a former employer. Because my position included customer service, I purchased RAVING FANS. The book takes a lighthearted look at the serious subject of customer service. It's easy to follow and contains valuable advice. It was good enough to be recommeneded to a co-worker, who has since gone into business for herself. While reading, I realized what wonderful service I receive from waitresses, my hairdresser, and my mechanic. These people could have read this book from cover to cover. I think that readers will be pleasantly surprised to recognize people in their everyday life who have made their customers into Raving Fans. Unfortunately, the employer who recommended Blanchard to me was not interested in reading the book. He didn't like my implementing Blanchard's suggestions -- despite clients calling and, indeed, RAVING, that the lessons I learned were increasing business. I ultimately left the job, and hope to be able to use he advice in the future."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book is written in \\"parable\\" or story telling format and is different to read for most people. If you have read the best seller One Minute Manager or Leadership and the One Minute Manager it is written in comparable form. I have read both of the prior books.First off, the book basically talks about customer service (vs. goal setting &amp; reward/punishment in the one minute manager) and how companies need to offer exemplary service to create Raving Fans, as the authors title it. I was simply hoping to get one good idea/thought out of the book and I did. It was EXCEPTIONALLY easy to read, as I read the 132 pages in about 2.5 - 3 hours total. The book has a lot of dead space and big font so you aren't getting tons of \\"filler.\\" The authors try to focus on one business issue and address it succinctly.This book is good and bad depending on what you expect to get out of it.It is good because (1) anyone can read this book (2) customer service is horrible in today's environment so it is timely (3) The book provides great illustrations and (4) The authors get the point across.Having said that, they never talk about the business implications of what the characters do. They say that customers love their service or product but they negate to talk about the cost implications. Business is about making money, not being loved by everyone. I love great service and all the frills but, at the end of the day, I have to make it worth the investment to the business owner.Yes, our economy is very much about selling an experience to someone, but there are cost implications to having carpeted floors in grocery stores and full service gas stations that don't price their gas more expensively. There are implications to buying a product at another store and selling it at the exact same price to your customer (what about the price of labor?) In that case you are actually LOSING money, except that the customer is happy.....At the end of the day profits pay for the labor, rent, etc. Businesses have to make money and this part is really neglected in this book.I love that they focus on the customer and finding out what their needs are but they negate to mention where people are in the food chain. What does the customer value the most? Is your business positioned to offer it? Do you offer headaches or tons of value to the customer are a few questions I think of daily?If anyone is looking for a great business book check out The Essential Drucker by Peter Drucker as it is the best book I have read on management and the role of managers, businesses and individuals within a business. Your money and time would be better spent on that book."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"In a world of almost no service, RAVING FANS takes the opposite perspective -- that virtually perfect service is worth pursuing. Those who are used to providing and suffering from having no service will find this book impossible to comprehend. I found it inspiring.A major problem with most books on management processes is that that do too little to focus on how to make large amounts of progress beyond what is now done. RAVING FANS is a big success in providing you with simple instructions for making large strides toward achievable perfection in providing service.Imagining perfection is a critical first step to improvement, yet most people have never thought about what that could mean. Then testing that perfection with customers (and potential customers) must be done to be sure that there is a valid opportunity, and to be able to understand customers' ideas about achievable perfection. Then attaching the idea of continuous improvement toward that vision is also valuable, and useful.There are plenty of practical tips about how to do each part in RAVING FANS, which is key to making this book so valuable.One of the reasons that I enjoy writing reviews about books on-line is that I can find a book like RAVING FANS that agrees so much with my own perspective and research. This book will quickly get you past your Psychology of Disbelief, Bureaucracy, Procrastination, Communiation, and Ugly Duckling stalls. Good for Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles . . . and good for you, too! Even better for your customers!If you like this book, be sure to go on to read GUNG HO, the second book in the series, which deals with getting employees fired up to produce great service for Raving Fans. The third book in the series, BIG BUCKS!, just came out, and is a worthwhile successor to the first two. I suggest you read all three if you have a business or aspire to have one that provides well for employees, customers, and owners.A good related book is THE CUSTOMER CENTERED COMPANY by Richard Whiteley."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Raving fans is the story of a manager that finds himself in charge of a failing department. He is given the position with the understanding that he HAS to fix things, and fix them quickly. To the rescue comes his \\"fairy godmother\\" Charlie-a guardian angel with a penchant for golf and a great deal of information about how to make customers more than satisfied.Through this parable the manager and the reader learn there are three rules for making your customers \\"Raving Fans\\". First, decide what you want. Second, discover what the customer wants. Third, deliver plus one.Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles have done an excellent job of boiling down excellent customer service to its essence. The rules are easy to read and simple to understand. But, like most things of consequence they will take time to master. This book is well worth the hour or two it will take to read.However, delivering excellent service is only part of the equation. To have a truly profitable well-run organization you also need to have excellent leadership, a highly motivated team, and value-driven goals. While this book touches on these subjects it certainly doesn't do them justice. For a clearer picture I would also recommend reading \\"Gung-Ho!\\", \\"Leadership By The Book\\", and \\"The One Minute Manager\\" -all part of Ken Blanchard's library of leadership materials. All of them are quick reads, and amazingly informative. Together they create an excellent picture of how a successful, value-centered organization should be run."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Blanchard gets two stars for choosing to write a book on the importance of customer service. Beyond his choice of topics, however, this silly little screed doesn't have much going for it. Once you buy into the premise that customer service is important (as, of course, you should), your next concern will logically be what to do about it. There's nothing in this book that will provide you with any practical help in that regard. Like most of Blanchard's other books, this is a lot like cotton candy...cloyingly sweet, lots of fluff, and very little substance.Blanchard considers himself to be a spiritual guy. (The title he uses at his company is Chief Spiritual Officer.) As a result, Raving Fans, like other Blanchard-branded books, employs a format that is self-consciously based on the Biblical parable. Perhaps he considers this to be an homage but it just comes across as pretentious.If a reader was genuinely undecided on the value of customer service, then this book might be worthwhile. But for the vast majority of readers who understand that customer service is important and want to know how to get better at it, Raving Fans isn't going to provide any practical guidance."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"The intellectual content of this little book could fit nicely and succinctly in a 500-1000 word magazine or journal venue. Instead, Blanchard sticks to the successful story telling formula that served him well in The One Minute Manager. The concepts are good, and I think their true value lies in their simplicity. They are easily understood and therefore should be easy to apply. Successful implementation may be another matter. If you agree with the concepts, and it's hard to see how you wouldn't, the actual book is a great tool to get them out to your people. The long narrative has the effect of beating the points into your head and the examples leave little to the imagination as to how the concepts can be fleshed out. I have found that people who last raved about Who Moved My Cheese also rave about this book. Those who don't care for this type of cutesy, least common denominator writing style will try to get through it as fast as possible and glean the concepts for further consideration afterwards. It can be read cover to cover in about an hour and a half at a pretty leisurely pace. Regardless of whether or not you like the style of the book I think you will find the concepts and down to earth examples good food for thought in your own enterprise."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Raving Fans is helpful in making you step back and think about your customer's wants and how to best address them.

This is then applied to his own job and the unique challenges the area manager faces daily with providing customer service.Though not all the ideas in \\"Raving Fans\\" seem plausible or reasonable, it atleast draws the reader into asking the questions that all good managers should ask. What would Raving Fan service be in my business or organization?

Decide what you want to give to the customer, Find out their needs and expectations, Foresee how you can fulfil their requirements - The main theme of this book perfectly teaches the Customer Approach. Raving Fans of Ken Blanchard love to read all his Books coz of his Innovative ideas and writing skills. I love all Ken's Reads and this one is no exception as it has all inspirational, encouraging, innovative and satisfying techniques to build better Customer Relationships. This book has proven techniques as it covers on 'After-service' facilities too and for a Corporate Insurance Executive & Advisor like me, I feel people sort for not only Service but also 'After sales Service' which builds a strong rapport with the customer and a long term, beneficial relationship, floating in more references therein. I heard a Doctor who had his Sonography Machines worth more than a 50 lacs insured but could not get the claim inspite of paying premiums only because the Company had waved off old machines and the new hubs cost him grand. The customer service is failed by Agent due to Govt. Insurance companies and in such cases, I guess it is worth a deal to strike with new better Insurance companies with affiliations. Hence, Ken's book is all about effective system and playing role as serving with style to create revolution at workplace and fetch in good business. Every Executive should read and follow Ken Blanchard's techniques and remember that Customers are not Satisfied anymore but require 'Service' and that is most important.

Typically I would have gone to the store to purchase instead of waiting."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"i give this book (and its companion, 'Gung Ho') a hugely generous 2 for its ideas' potential.i guess i'm the only person in the business world who is offended by being talked to like a kindergartner. considering the way this book (and 'Gung Ho' is only slightly less offensive and slightly more interesting) has been received (at least by upper management), my and my coworkers intelligence is highly underrated. i don't appreciate being hand-fed potentially good ideas with the open-wide-here-comes-the-airplane-zoom-zoom-h ere-it's-good-for-you,-and-in-a-language-you- can-understand!! type of delivery. thus the good ideas go down like medicine with a bad kick.great ideas, bad delivery unless you're a grade school overachiever. and the half inch letters don't do anything for forest preservation. it could probably be typed out in normal size in a 10 page pamphlet (if that). you'll find yourself turning the page about every 15 seconds, unless of course you're still sounding out the words as you go.the most interesting thing about this series of books is they are insanely well received by upper management (as mentioned before), but scoffed by the employees that are forced to read them. while this reaction may seem to contradict the books' message, well... duh. treating your employees like they 'matter' doesn't include assuming they can't read at levels above the 3rd grade."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Outstanding. Exhilirating. Simple and an amusing read. It tells us(entrepreneurs) how we should be on the alert to create raving fans. There is no other way of giving customer service for Blanchard. Otherwise, it will be to just raise your customers' low expectations. This book is for everyone that is going to begin or continue a wonderful career in customer service."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book is a light quick read with nothing of much substance.

This book was a simple story which illustrated a simple point about customer service. That's it. I purchased it thinking I would have \\"Raving Fans\\" but the book is far too simple and effective service is more complex. If you're hungry for growth and knowledge don't read it or feel influenced to purchase it. It's something I would imagine a very low level customer service worker reading for a little inspiration. If you're starving for just a little inspiration and 2nd grade storytelling, then purchase it."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"A major problem with most books on management processes is that that do too little to focus on how to make large amounts of progress beyond what is now done. Raving Fans is a big success in providing you with simple instructions for making large strides toward achievable perfection.Imagining perfection is a critical first step to improvement, yet most people have never thought about what that could mean. Then testing that perfection with customers (and potential customers) must be done to be sure that there is a valid opportunity, and to be able to understand customers' ideas about achievable perfection. Then attaching the idea of continuous improvement toward that vision is also valuable, and useful. There are plenty of practical tips about how to do each part, which is key to making this book so valuable.One of the reasons that I enjoy writing reviews about books on-line is that I can find a Raving Fans that agrees so much with my own perspective and research. This book will quickly get you past your Psychology of Disbelief, Bureaucracy, Procrastination, Communiation, and Ugly Duckling stalls.Good for Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles . . . and good for you, too!"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book is dumbed down to an elementary level. There are sooooo many better sales books out there. This is a silly story about customer service that no company would ever really do. All companies want to make \\"raving fans\\", but the reality most companies just use the concept and this book as a silly attempt to think they want to attain \\"raving fans\\", but in the end, they are out for a profit 1st and then hopefully some fans 2nd. I'm ok with that, but don't say you want raving fans, when you surround yourself with meaningless slogans, such as \\"Raving Fans\\" and \\"Yes\\" men. When I finished reading this book, I said to myself... \\"Really, this whole book was just some silly story about places and people that are made up?!?\\". Don't waste your time. Buy a REAL sales book."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"The Raving Fans audio book that I purchased was poorly acted (the character voices were so forced and contrived)and the content was so common sense that I learned little from it.

But I instantly fell in love with Charlie, and the manager too.

The elegantly simple 3-step process of \\"Decide, Discover, and Deliver +1\\" builds customer confidence and trust by consistently selecting customers who are perfect for your business and then perfectly fulfilling your promises to them. It provides a powerful framework to align the interactions of your marketing, sales, and operations teams.My only complaint is the absence of emphasis on demonstrating and communicating your care/concern for that perfect customer during the entire process. Summarizing an often quoted research study, 68% of dissatisfied customers who voted with their feet (and selected a new vendor to do business with) did so because of a problem with their perception of the customer/supplier relationship. They felt that their former vendor simply did not care enough about them. I recommend adding a 4th step by following the advice in \\"Mr. Schmooze\\" by Richard Abraham to alleviate this shortcoming.In spite of the above critique, I still rated this book a 5-Star Classic that all business leaders and marketing/sales pros should read."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"A fast read that focuses on the core principles of customer service.

This is a must read for anyone who has customers."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I bought this book because I run a small business. Very small. Just me and my wife Vesta. We're photographers and we got customers, some of which I have on occasion tended to piss off in one way or another. So Vesta insisted I do something to get a handle on my customer relations, because, after all, we want them to come back again. So I bought this book. Don't know if it helped me much, but I enjoyed it.

As a new business owner, it was great reading this book now as oppose to 2-5 years later. The concepts of creating raving fans is simple:1. Decide what you want to do - create a vision in your mind of what perfect customer service could be. Then, bring the vision out of your mind and into your organization.2. Discover what the customer wants - Discover what your customer really wants and then alter your vision (if applicable). Listen to your clients - especially to what they \\"are not\\" saying.3. Deliver Plus one - Deliver consistent service, using the 1% rule [change at least 1% of what you're already doing].The examples given in this book really brought the key ideas out. One thing that hit home was the idea of asking the client what they really want. Sometimes what we think our customers need may not be what they want. But, we'll never be able to fill the gap unless we ask questions.Again, this was a great book. Very easy to read - I finished it in one day. I'd definitely recommend this to my colleagues.Margo ThomasMarlynn Consulting Group&lt;...>"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Raving fans is an excellent book for those that are trying to improve their businesses customer service and how the customer is viewed.

As with so many 'it's so easy to change' manuals many of us do not approach these literary equivalents of junk food by ourselves.

Somehow golf gets thrown into this groundbreaking revelation - I thought that the author Kenneth Blanchard was going to announce that he received this message from GOd in 5 tablets. Of course as with all thse guides nothing is mentioned to the employer about the possibility that service does not improve all by itself and that a good salary and working conditions may induce a more positive work attitude.

In response to Mike from Utah...exactly who do you think works in the customer service industry? The vast majority of American service providers are minimum wage earners, and, yes, some like their jobs. Employers have to keep them motivated somehow. This book not only provides a peek at how to do that, but, in typical Blanchard style, is a lighthearted, easy to understand read. The book says nothing about &quot;automation employees&quot;.

I ordered these for our medical device sales team and it was very well received. We spent the next few weeks sharing ideas on how to apply the lessons learned and provide RAVING FAN service to our customers. One of the most prominent themes is that customer service starts with the person (sales, technical, etc...) who is front of the customer, not necessarily the person sitting in an office at the customer service desk.Like many of Blanchard's books, it's a quick and breezy read. I initially read it on a flight, but it's great to go back to and reference. \\"Decide what you want, decide what the customer wants and deliver what the customer wants...plus one\\" are the primary themes.Overall, it's fairly simplistic, common sense type material but a great reminder of how all those in sales and service should treat a customer."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book offers the best approach to customer service I have ever heard of.

Developing raving fans is the premise of another parable written by Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles. Customer service can make or break a business and this book provides you with the three secrets to developing \\"raving fans.\\"Ken Blanchard has coauthored a series of business-building parables that are short, easy to read and filled with ways to improve your business skills. Raving Fans; A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service takes a newly promoted Area Manager through a series of business-building aha's that show him how to revolutionize his company's customer service policy and develop raving fans.At the beginning of the book, the Area Manager realizes that we, as consumers, have come to expect and accept poor customer service. Our Area Manager is given a golf loving Fairy Godmother named Charlie who shares three secrets for developing extraordinary customer service.Fairy Godmother Charlie explains the premise of the book this way, \\"Your customers are only satisfied because their expectations are so low and because no one else is doing better. Just having satisfied customers isn't good enough anymore. If you really want a booming business, you have to create Raving Fans.\\"Here's what the Area Manager learned:1. Decide what you want. Great customer service begins with the vision your business holds of how customers should be treated. What is the \\"ideal experience\\" you'd like customers to have every time they deal with you and your company? If you closed your eyes and visualized an ideal customer experience, what would it look like?2. Discover what your customer really wants. Now that you have your ideal customer service experience designed in your mind, it is time to figure out what your customer wants. You do this by asking, and listening to what is and isn't being said by your customers.3. Deliver the vision plus one percent. Give your customer more than they expect. Know what customers want and then exceed their expectations. Have them raving about their buying and service experiences.Building a customer service policy around these three secrets will develop Raving Fans.To truly appreciate this book, you have to enjoy reading parables. You also have to allow yourself to enjoy the entertainment factor of Raving Fans. This isn't a textbook or serious how-to business book, this is an entertaining book with a business-building message.The overall customer service message is a good one: Our customers deserve exceptional customer service because satisfied customers just aren't good enough if we want to stay in business. It's practical message and one that should be taken seriously. Our current and future customers have choices and the question becomes, why should they choose to do business with you?I recommend Raving Fans by Ken Blanchard as an easy read about how to develop exceptional customer service. The only caveat would be that you have to appreciate a far-fetched story line written as a parable."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Anyone wanting to improve their customer service should read this book! Follow the approach, and customers will be raving about you and telling everyone they know!"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Hmm, there are points in this book that are great, but was put into a fable that just distracted from the good this book was offering. Customer Service is mediocre at best these days and just by going a little above and beyond can make a difference with your customers and turn them into ambassadors for your business. I just wish Mr Blanchard[author: Ken Blanchard] stuck with the points of the book and developed real world examples around them and how to do the work in a more informational format. The attempt at building a story around the points and even how it's attempt at relating to the reader was more of a distraction than it was a reinforcement."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This is a quick and easy book to read. The concepts presented in this book to improving Customer Service is very possible. The ideas presented is interesting and really makes me aware how I have been \\"just satisfied\\" with all the bad customer service all around us. Ken gets his points across by using short events and dialogs between the characters. However, the short events, products, etc... seems to be too fantasy and very fictional. I would have been more convinced if he had used real life examples. The concepts presented, however, are very logical and very implementable."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This is not just another Blanchard book delivering another important business message via a parable, this time on the secrets to customer service. The secrets are concisely delivered with three memorable points. Decide what you want. Discover what your customer wants. Deliver more than they need. A simple approach that is harder to execute than it is to read about. Well worth the short time it takes to read about it. Remember that the hard work is in the execution. There is no quick fix to develop and sustain raving fans. But neither is the task impossible. Go for it.

Through the usual storyline you are presented with a three step plan, interlinked and integrated, that you can immediately apply to the work place. In the electronic age we should all be using this work to frame the way we are going to manage our relationships. Quality is all about how your product or service works in relation to the customer's needs.

Ordered another used book at the same time from another Amazon source and it arrived 3-4 days sooner."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"By definition, a \\"raving fan\\" is a customer that is so happy with your company that they praise your actions to anyone who might possibly listen. They are the best form of advertisement and the hardest to acquire. Changing your customer service strategy so that you have raving fans rather than customers is the point of this book and the story is told in parable form.The two main characters are Area Manager and Charlie, his male fairy \\"godmother.\\" Using the magic that all fairy godmothers possess, Charlie takes Area Manager to several companies that generate their own raving fans. The strategy is common and ubiquitous across industries; treat your customer as a coveted and valued asset rather than a source of revenue to be squeezed.Another very important point is that to be successful in the area of customer service, you must first decide what you want to do. A fundamental component of this is to realize that not all potential customers are desirable ones. The fact is that some people are simply unsuitable as customers. Decide up front that they are not what you want to do and don't do it. Focus on what you can and want to do well.Ken Blanchard has once again been an author of a book that points the way to success in business. The path to success is by providing quality service that appears costly, but that is a mirage. Good customer service is one of the best ways possible to make money and save time by spending money and using time to provide it. This is one of the best management books ever written, made even better by the simplicity of the presentation."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This is one of the most informative and fun-to-read books I've ever read.

Beyond that we are only limited by our ability to translate what we \\"hear\\" from our clients and use our imaginations to delight them. In the end, we must differentiate ourselves (positively) and stand above the crowd. We must also inspire our Team to do so as well, for that is how long-term results are achieved. This book, through the use of storytelling (and some fantasy), illustrates how we can turn those \\"shoppers\\" into clients for life who can't stop bragging about us and buying from us.

It should have been presented as a bulleted list, not a book."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"As a ministry leader of a growing team of 50+ volunteers--a team that works with 250+ kids each week--I have found Raving Fans to be an Awesome, applicable, and transformative tool. If brevity is the soul of wit, then this book, with its broad but simple principles, contains the soul of adaptability and the spirit of the possible.In a world where bad customer service sometimes seems the acceptable baseline, and where bureaucratic short-sightedness, pessimism, and sloth hold sway, Mr. Blanchard is a prophet of hope.In this brief book, Mr. Blanchard gives us three principles--tools for remaking the every day into the extraordinary. Underlying these tools is one great truth: people matter.Just read the other reviews. Those let down or skeptical about this book all seem to have missed or simply denied this foundational point.So--you are forewarned. Raving Fans is a deeply humanistic book. If you are looking for a quick fix or a new gimmick, best look elsewhere.If you are looking for a new outlook that can serve as a lasting and solid foundation in dealing with customers of all kinds (be they paying customers--or people you serve in some other way) then let me suggest that this is the book for you.As a ministry leader I have found this book invaluable for 4 reasons:1. The people focus I mentioned above. All too often we (everybody--you, me, the president...) get caught in webs of our own systems and plans. All customer relations boil down to serving people. This book's laser-like focus in this regard is cleansing and clarifying.2. To get to where we want to be in our service of others, we must first dream big. Another author calls this \\"Visioneering.\\" Too many of us have dreamt small. I love that this book would have us first paint the perfect picture of what we want. Let me tell you from experience: there is no better way to do this than to first imagine what whatever you're doing would look like if money and resources were not an issue. You are selling yourself, and all those you will ever work with, short if you do any less.3. This book talks at some length about how to listen to people--their words, as well as their \\"music\\". Again, if you are not willing to make people your focus (trust me--it is not easy--but everything else cannot fall in line until you do) this part of the book will sound like nonsense to you. And you will continue to fail. After all, let's be honest: a lot of us come to books like these because we know something is missing--or better yet, someone else knows/sees something is missing and has given us a copy of the book.4. I love how Raving Fans deals with continual improvement--or as we call it where I serve: striving for ever-greater excellence. I won't ruin this point by giving it away. It alone is worth the cost of the book.And I hope Ken Blanchard keeps writing and selling a lot of books. He has helped me, and as an extension, those I lead and serve, immensely.For that I say \\"thank you.\\"I give this book a heartfelt, and raving, recommendation."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"In RAVING FANS, authors Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Knowlesconcentrated on the importance of delighting customers . . . in GUNGHO!, they focused on how companies could become the &quot;employer ofchoice&quot; and attract the best employees . . . I liked both thosebooks and thus looked forward to listening to the taped version ofBIG BUCKS! . . . this third book promised me in its subtitle &quot;Howto Make Serious Money for Both You and Your Company,&quot; somethingthat could be done by focusing my time and energy.Like other works by Blanchard and Knowles, the points arepresented in a parable . . . here, we're introduced to a man strugglingto make ends meet . . . he goes on a journey to discover the secretto becoming rich and meets three wise (and successful) peoplewho present simple truths that can be applied to virtually anysituation.I liked the above fact; i.e., that when listening, I found myselfthinking that this stuff makes sense--and I should and couldapply it to my situation . . . there's nothing overly earth-shattering,yet I should add that it got me thinking . . . and it made sense.Also making sense was the conclusion, in which the authorsreviewed the simple tests that should have been learned fromeither reading or listening:The test of joy . . . you can't make money unless you're having fun.The test of purpose . . .you can't make money unless making moneyis more important than having fun.The test of creativity . . . incomes, less expenses = profit.And, lastly, there's perpetual prosperity . . . which comes to thosewho help others."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"If you work in, run or are starting a customer call center, this is the BEST book to read! It has brought our team an amazing up lift and everyone comes to work and works like the company is theirs! You must read the book!"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Like other Blanchard books, this one presents its ideas in the form of a \\"novel.\\" I guess because I read so much fiction (by authors who can WRITE), I have a hard time getting through these books. There are lots of lazy habits in the story-telling and even though RAVING FANS is incredibly short, it still feels like a slog getting through it. One example: one just one short page, two different characters have lines of dialogue, followed by \\"he laughed.\\" As in, \\"'I never thought of that,' he laughed.\\" Not many people laugh their words. They may say something and THEN laugh. Once or twice in a book it's okay, but twice on ONE PAGE!! The main character who is learning about the \\"raving fan\\" concept is \\"the area manager.\\" It gets really annoying having him refered to in this manner from front to back. Would it really have hurt to give him a name? The darn \\"fairy godmother\\" has a name, after all.But, the book is supposed to present business ideas, right? Well, it does this a little better than it tells a compelling story. The over-arching point is that \\"satisfied customers\\" aren't good enough anymore, because they are largely putting up with lousy service, but have simply come to expect and accept it. That's actually a simple but powerful idea. How many times do we all just take mediocrity as status quo? The idea that actually taking the trouble to please our customers...to SHOCK them into recognized they are being treated remarkably well and will in turn \\"rave\\" about this to others is compelling in its simplicity.Because of the storytelling device of the book, some of the examples given of how to apply this are oversimplistic and not completely believable. Valet parking at a grocery store? I'm sure people WOULD rave about it...but with the margins at grocery stores, could they really afford a team of parkers?So, from a business standpoint, the book gets a thumbs-up. From a readability standpoint, I have to give a thumbs down."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Definitely worth reading for a fresh perspective on any kind of customer service. (We're in software.) Fresh, not rehashed ideas."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This is not a new book, but the message is as meaningful today as when the book was first introduced. If you think you have a great business because you have satisfied customers, you really need to read this. Satisfied customers are not enough!

I must say to those who thought after reading this book that it was pointless, simplistic to the point of insulting, disappointing, or over the top, that it's just that exact mentality the whole book is based on. I really hate to color one gender in this fashion but it unfortunately is true, usually it's a man who can't possibly see that the solutions to most customer service problems are just that simplistic. It may seem corny, over the top, or maybe simplistic but this book clearly addresses the problem with customer service today, in that no one cares or is brave enough to venture returning to true customer oriented values, or brave enough to be different. It's all about squeezing that dollar for more than what it's worth, instead of investing that dollar to develop long term loyal customers. Customers that will go out of their way to do business with a provider if the provider cares enough about them to listen to them and give above what they are expecting. I know what I am talking about, I am a customer, and at best I only occasionally see a flicker of barely satisfactory customer service actions with the business's I donate my dollars to, but for the most part my customer service experiences are definitely a \\"No-Customer-Service kinda Customer Service World\\". Not only am I a customer but I am a customer service provider as well. I have always performed my job with the Raving Fan mentality; I just didn't know what it was called. It's good to know that my work reputation is directly related to providing \\"Raving Fan\\" type Customer service. It's too bad that the majority of business's out there are managed by the mentality, that it's all about the dollar and the customer is privileged to have me as a provider."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Keep It Simple Stupid...and Ken Blanchard does just that!

Tho only drawback to the audiobook was one of the actor's voices...the Fairy Godmother nearly drove me up a wall."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book claims to teach readers about great customer service. Unfortunately the examples of great customer service in the book are made-up companies that would not be in business if they really existed. I'd much prefer to read about the customer service practices of real organizations that are renowned in their field, like Nordstrom, USAA or the Ritz Carlton. (Or Amazon!)"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I recently read Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach To Customer Service by Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowes. Written as a parable designed to illustrate why the key to greatness in business is developing \\"raving fans,\\" this book was informative and fun to read. The premise is that \\"satisfied\\" customers just aren't good enough!It's so common for us to focus on satisfying our customers and feel that we've done our job, but in a nutshell customer satisfaction is not a very lofty goal - and mere satisfaction doesn't keep customers coming back. The book is written as a story about the newly promoted \\"Area Manager\\" and his male fairy godmother, Charlie. Charlie exposes the Area Manager to a number of different successful businesses that are going above and beyond with the services they offer and creating loyal and devoted customers in the process.Think about it: we are so accustomed to mediocre or bad service these days, that we just accept it as the norm. The book does a great job of pointing out that if you think that you're doing a good job for your customers because they're not complaining, you're missing the point. A lot of customers walk away from a bad experience - or a less than satisfactory one - disappointed or unimpressed, but not upset enough to call it to your attention.That really hit home, because I know I've been there. You go to a restaurant, your meal is okay, but the food is cold, or the service is really slow, or you have to go find your server to request your check. Then, as you walk out the door, the manager or host asks, \\"How was your meal tonight?\\" and you answer with an unenthusiastic \\"It was fine, thank you.\\" How likely are you to recommend that restaurant to the friend you bump into later? But, the manager has no idea about the laundry list of things that could be improved. You were satisfied, but you're not going to end up being a force in growing his business.I found the story in the book to be a really interesting way to introduce three critical steps for increasing customer loyalty. You must first decide what you want to do with customers, realizing that you can't be all things to all people and focusing on what you do well. The second step involves discovering what your customers really want within your what. And, finally, you aim to always \\"Deliver Plus 1 Percent\\" on your what, which means being consistent and always improving just a little bit. In return, you'll be creating customers who are so thrilled by what you do that they go around bragging about your service and recommending your business to others. Who couldn't use an army of raving fans promoting their services at every turn?The concept is so simple - the book has been around since 1992 and has a solid reputation - but the idea could almost be considered revolutionary. Because the three steps are described in a story, the book doesn't have a lot of very practical step-by-step guidance. But, I did find my mind racing a little bit with new ideas as I read. It was a pretty easy read and there is also a good audio version of the book that could make it even easier to fit into your schedule.I highly recommend this book for anyone who finds himself thinking, \\"What's next for my business?\\" If you're looking to improve your client relationships and their experience with your business, this book is a great way to start. It's really a very commonsense approach - and it's surprising that more businesses don't adopt it, particularly in their customer service departments. Imagine the power of even just half of your customers turning into cheerleaders for your business? It's word-of-mouth advertising that is literally priceless - and it's \\"advertising\\" that you can \\"pay\\" for by just improving how you care for the customers you have."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I used this book as the basis for educating several of my small business owner clients on how to create raving fans. When I first started the book, I was turned off by the story telling approach. Then I realized that there was real content on how to produce top quality customer service. I made a list of great ideas from the book and easily got dozens of good ideas.I would recommend this book because it quickly gets the point across on the importance of raving fans and how to generate them."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"It hasn't been too long since I started in the Customer Service industry, but I do have to say this book has changed my entire way of thinking when it comes to customer service. I highly reccomend it, and it doesn't matter what type of company you work for, somewhere along the line you have to answer to customers, whether it is someone at a store buying a product from you directly, or whether it is someone that works on the other side of the assembly line, a customer is whoever comes in contact with your product. I absolutely reccomend this book to anyone who has ever been dissatisfied before."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This is an excellent book that explains in basic terms how to improve customer service in any kind of organization.Once I began reading it, I couldn't stop until I finished it."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This is a Blanchard classic.

Instead of getting out and actually finding out how his staff feel about their jobs, their coworkers, their customers and the company, he devours trite little one-size-fits-all management books like this one. His office is full of them, and he orders them by the case to hand out to his favorite people (instead of pay raises, oh goody).The one lesson to be learned from Ken Blanchard, et al., is that if you really want to to make lots of money in business, put together a how-to book on management full of trite tips like &quot;show your customers you really care&quot;, and &quot;encourage your employees to be creative&quot;, and follow up with a roadshow of seminars and training sessions.Offer motivational posters, keyrings, ball hats and mouse pads with content free inspirational messages for bosses to hand out to employees instead of actual perks and benefits, and offer fancy diplomas suitable for framing for those unlucky enough to be forced to attend seminars on their own time.The ideas in this book are really nothing more than vaseline."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"The other 2 books I ordered came in days from other companys.This books has taken a month and I still don't have it.Slow service.

The book is short and easy to read. However, it could have been even shorter. The book is a story. The concept of raving fans is taught to the reader through conversations between the story's characters. The concept of raving fans is useful, and I believe good for anyone owning a business to understand. However, the story in this book gets boring to read. There are a lot of conversations between the characters that I felt the author included simply to make the book over 100 pages. In other words, the book seems to \\"beat around the bush\\" a lot, just to teach a concept that could probably be taught in 20 pages or less.Overall I give the book 4/5 stars because I believe the need to learn the concept of raving fans outweighs the boredom I experienced at times as I read the book. The book would have received 5 stars, however, I have to deduct one star for the many pages of character conversations that should have been omitted from the book."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Every manager/leader should have this book along with Gung Ho.

Now, in the year 2011, with unemployment at an all-time high, it has been my experience to interact with CSR'S who inexplicably believe they have lifetime contracts at their workplace--motor vehicle rep talking with food in her mouth, another not making eye contact, an attorney's receptionist barking, etc.While the book does point out these deficiences, written in a very easy read--one sitting (if I can read it in an hour, it must be), nevertheless, some of the ideas seem far-fetched. For example, the gas station owner--they make an average on five cents per gallon. Where does he have it in his budget, for example, to have multiple lanes with employees cleaning customers' car windows all around? Likewise, the grocery business works on razor-thin margins. How can they possibly incorporate some of these ideas?The hotelier who went out and bought the exact brand of macaroni and cheese to satisfy a youngster, they could do that, it's a small investment.The \\"secrets\\" are thought-provoking. However, in this age of focus groups and neuro-marketing, depending on the venture, you may need to do more than just an informal survey.Thought-provoking and eye-raising in some ways, and not applicable in others.In my opinion, would best serve the self-propietor with unique ideas. The taxi driver in the book is a good example. I would recommend this book due to its simplicity, and it may provide a spark."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Raving Fans is another home run from the mind of Ken Blanchard!

The authors belabor their three points by hiding them within a story that is off-putting with the generic Area Manager being the guy whose shoes we're suppose to slip into so we can be guided by Charlie. Yet I recognize some of their techniques in the latest customer-centric policies that Walmart has tried to put into place within the last year. Other contemporary retail stores also trying to follow the idea of flouncing all over the customer and smothering them half-to-death while all the same time, never having enough cashiers to get people in and out. I think the authors really undersold themselves by presenting their ideas in this fantasy-driven format because it does not make it applicable to the real world and working with real people.So far the strongest driving home point was talking about customers saying they're \\"Fine\\" or silent. According to the book, this means that customers aren't telling you their real thoughts. I agree this might be a problem. However, as a cautionary warning, some customers like myself, just aren't chit-chatty and are just there to get my stuff and get out quickly. I'm not looking for a best friend in a retail store. Also from experience working retail, customers hate it if you call them by name. It's creepy and invasive.My other complaint is that despite my suspicions that the examples in the book are suppose to be a metaphor of some kind, I kept getting annoyed that the examples were in no way realistic to how REAL LIVE customers behave. Most notably were the valet parking and carpeting in a grocery store (you should have heard my dad laugh!) and giving people no limits on how many clothes they can take with them into a dressing room (has the author ever worked retail?!). I understand that this isn't the point of the reading, but I got so distracted by these hilariously poor examples that I can't take the book seriously."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Re: Raving Fans by Ken BlanchardI have a question. Why wasn't this book published as a leaflet? The entire lesson could have been taught in about 5 pages.While I agree with the three fundamental guidelines described in the book, I thought the structure of the book was a bit juvenile. The anecdotes were very farfetched and somewhat archaic. For example: (1) the cab driver who just happens to have a cooler full of soft drinks for her customers and two thermoses with regular and decaf coffee, and (2) the full-service gas station??? I could have thought up better stories than these. Or at least stories that apply to the real world.And what's with the golf? This isn't even relevant to the book....but it sure helps to take up space.I expect more out of a published author with his credentials. I've heard a lot about Blanchard, but haven't read any of his books until now. Rest assured I won't ever read one again. Perhaps that's the most important lesson I learned for my $20 spent.My recommendation: BORROW it from a friend if you're really interested."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book is very easy read, usually taking less tha a few hours.

They remind one of the bland, pleasant, smiling robots in the movie; \\"The Stepford Wives\\", except the business owners in this yarn have substituted their human employees for Stepford-style gas station attendants, grocery store clerks, and taxi cab drivers, all grinning, happy, and content with low paying, menial, nowhere jobs.The simplicity of the writing style is suitable for ages six and up, as the following passage illustrates;'\\"I'm not in touch with reality,\\" the Area Manager thought.\\"I've already gone off the deep end.\\" \\"No you haven't,\\" said the stranger, reading the Area Manager's mind. \\"Nothing is more real than your Fairy Godmother. You'll want to remember that.\\"\\"You can't be my Fairy Godmother,\\" the Area Manager challenged, \\"you're a man\\"'.....On the back cover of this important work are accolades from presidents of well known, billion dollar companies.It boggles the mind of this layman to try and figure out what prompted such reviews. My conclusion is this; rich people(such as the owner of the dealership where I was formerly employed) really ARE different, and to try and pass off this drivel as an erudite method to achieve improved customer service proves beyond a doubt that aliens do exist."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I read the reviews and had to agree with a number of the comments such as \\"being intellectually molested\\" \\"waste of time\\", etc. This book (I have a hard time calling it that) is like a high school term paper where you were asked to turn in X pages. The margins are so wide that this could have been printed at 3\\"x4\\" to fill a page rather than 6x9. Even if it included some useful facts, it wouldn't be worth $20. Then you read it and realize its nothing but a bunch of filler positioned as a line extension book from a well known author who has tarnished his \\"brand equity\\" with this poor excuse of a book. Very sad. I am a consumer advocate and have been in the business for 30+ years having read and written books on the subject. At least with books like The Ultimate Question, there is something pragmatic an organization can use."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Remember \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\"? How about \\"One Minute Manager\\"?Why is it people don't have the intestinal fortitude to call a bad business book a bad business book? Everyone seems to feel obligated to pass on the titles of these tossed-off-in-an-afternoon-over-a-glass-of-wine books.This one in particular says you should give GREAT service, not just good service. Since that wouldn't be a very long book, the author adds in a string of totally-unrelated references to golf, since we all know all business people must pretend to be avid golfers.Save your time, and save your money. This is common sense packaged in a shiny wrapper."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book has a rather flimsy message. Simply stated it is that you can smash your competition and achieve exceptional success in sales by adhering to a deceptively simple formula: Know what you want; know what the customer wants, deliver beyond the client's expectation, and never stop enhancing your service. The message is delivered in a writing style known as \\"mystical realism\\" in the fiction world, and which doesn't work quite as well in the non-fiction world. There is some real magic here, though, and it's on the cover of the book, \\"More than One Million copies sold.\\" This probably relates to the fact that the target audience is, in fact, probably not all that literate, that it reduces an MBA in Marketing to a 75 minute read, that the print is large, and of course the whimsical and all too frequent references to the game of golf. The fact is that salesfolk periodically need to have their batteries recharged, and this book is a quick-charge. It gives the reader the feeling that he has learned something new, and that the business world is really much less complex than appearances would suggest. I read it as mandatory preparation for a Xinnix seminar, and if they thought this book had exceptional value, I'm worried about how simplistic their seminar might be."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book is a waste of money and time (even though it only takes 1-2 hours to read this book). It is amazing to me that Ken Blanchard could charge $ for a book that is based on common sense and could be summarized in one page without losing any content. The premise of the book is that there are three \\"secrets\\" to customer services which are decide what you want, find out what your customers want and deliver the vision plus one percent. All the book is saying is that a business should have a vision of what it wants to accomplish, talk to its customers to ensure that this vision is aligned to customer expectations, and then deliver the vision consistently while always looking to improve (plus one). There are a few fictional examples of businesses that have excellent customer service but definitely not much depth at all."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I read this book at the request of our manager and I feel as if I have been intellectually molested. Regurgitating trite catch phrases against the backdrop of every managers wetdream of mindlessly devoted automaton employees who seem content with their minimum wage jobs is not the best way to further motivate your own employees. The only thing that I learned from this senseless slaying of trees is that if an old man named Charlie, claiming to be my fairy godmother invites me into his car and tells me to close my eyes and not open them untill he says so, I should turn and run in the opposite direction."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I am just wondering why isn't there a 0 star rating.

I just can't believe the ridiculous examples and the lack of any thought about the cost side of the operations. Have valet parking and own shopper assistant in a grocery store and STILL SAVE MONEY. Please, please first check the cost structure of a grocery store and see that their gross margins are rarely more than 3%. Buying from competitors and selling at what you pay for plus free wrapping? Hm, and the employee will be paid from where? Just don't want to continue with the insulting and completely nonsense format of the book....I rarely write reviews, but this one was so pretentious with nothing to back it up, that I just had to vent and warn - please never, ever try to read that book!!"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Provides guidance for much needed resurrection of \\"customer service\\" as it was taught in the 1960s."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Raving fans is an easy read for the entire team.

For example, Best Buy refuses to pick up the phone when you call their stores or ask for a manager, so I make sure to return calls to parents within 24 hours, no matter when or where I am at.This book will teach you so much and will teach you to respect raving fan service and to note when someone or thing does not give raving fan service.

Of course, in today's society, customer service has been flushed down the drain and I know many companies who need to have these basic principles shoved down their throat. However, the storyline in this book completely takes away from these principles. I understand the authors were attempting to make it more interesting, and I could even deal with the \\"Fairy Godmother\\" part of the story, but the companies used to illustrate \\"raving fan service\\" are completely illogical, and I feel that this really took away from the basic customer service principles that the book conveys."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Beware. The thesis is excellent, but the &quot;Readers Digest&quot;-style writing is extremely lightweight and annoying. This is a fluffy, motivational &quot;parable&quot; about becoming customer focused.

I'm glad I did.It is a business fable, in traditional Blanchard style that tells story that is good enough to keep you engaged to lead and remember through repetition the keys points to creating \\"raving fans.\\" While it may not be the best story of the books in this genre, it does illuminate important factors about doing more that satisfying Customers, but rather turning them into fans - a bar much higher than \\"satisfaction.\\"Written in 1993, the subtitle is \\"A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service.\\" While I'm not sure it is revolutionary 12 years later, it is still worth reading. Consider this a great primer for Customer Service or a great book to encourage many to read because it is short and assessable even to those who don't read much."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book was a gigantic disappointment. The whole \\"male fairy godmother\\" thing just insulted my intelligence from the beginning. What could have been an insightful book about real customer service impacts really \\"lost it on the dismount.\\" The examples of customer strategy seemed forced and stretched beyond plausibility. The key character did not really seem to wrestle or grapple with many of the concepts. A business fable should inspire action, and this book simply did nothing. It wasn't a bad \\"read\\" per se. There were some entertaining facets, but it you are really looking to wow your customers and turn your business around, this is not the book for you. No matter how time-constrained you might be for a read on the topic, this will not be a good investment."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I read this book last summer after I lost my sales job. My ex-boss didn't have a clue about customer service, or even being a human for that matter. It was money, money, money.The Raving Fans thinking is the work ethic I now look for in a potential employer. As the world grows larger and more competitive, I think we seek out some &quot;human touch&quot; where ever we can find it, and by trying to please your customers, you then keep them as your customers! I really liked the enthusiasm of this book, and have talked about it with many people and a lot of friends have read it and agreed. It is a book that every employer should have each and every one of his/her employees read! Just fabulous! It's a shot in the arm, I only wish I had read it before last July..."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"My management demanded that all of us read this book (not that long after they laid off people because they said they weren't making money). Since they were enthusiastic about this book, it's little wonder they couldn't make any money in running a business. Blanchard writes in a ridiculous style -- about sixth grade level -- with inane characters and \\"plot,\\" and the examples he uses to illustrate his points fail the test of simple logic.As noted by an earlier reviewer, you don't make money in labor-intensive businesses having people perform unnecessary jobs. I'll bypass the related fact that no one with ambition or intelligence would want to stay at any of these jobs for any length of time or work for anyone so clueless.I've been forced to read Blanchard on at least two occasions by management in companies where I have worked. That Mr. Blanchard continues to sell books validates my opinion of most of the managers I have encountered of late in American business."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"The book starts off on a positive note. The author notes the modern generalization that good service in any business is no longer expected. Then, it takes a turn for the worse. The rediculous examples are insulting to anyone with an IQ above 100.The pervasive concepts contradict the work of Michael Porter on generic business strategies. You simply cannot be the service and quality leader and also be the cost leader. The worst example is the gas station where they will clean your windows, check your fluids, and generate small talk. All of this while maintaining a lower labor cost than the self serve station down the street. I know one of them actually owned service stations with a similar model in Canada, but I suspect other factors were in force.I don't think it's worth the time reading it."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I read a lot of books on business and customer service, and this one has a few simple truths that blew me away. The rest of the book is really cheesy, though, and the storyline is just silly...but I've been spoiled by Patrick Lencioni's leadership fables! Taking the three principles and applying them is completely worth it, and the more realistic examples will help anyone who is looking to improve their company's \\"soft side\\" greatly."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I used this in coordination with a canned Attitude training and got great results from my Customer Service group. It really made them think before they reacted to any call or inquiry from internal and external customers. Everyone that deals with people ought to read this book."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"We were assigned to read this as part of a team bonding exercise. I work for a non-profit, so our customers are our members, but also each other. Looking at it from that perspective, the ideas here were pretty good. It's not about the customer always being right, but they are your customer and it's your job to make sure that they are always pleased 110%, even when they don't expect it. It's a quick read and definitely will give you something to think about. Of course, I'd love to find a store that works the way the grocery store in this book does!"},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I was given this book several years ago and read it a few times. I gave it to a client and have missed my copy so I will be buying another copy. Sure, the examples such as the service station and grocery store scenarios are simplistic and may be unrealistic, but they make you think about how you could improve your business. I have conducted my business on the principles in the book and I see the positive growth. Every business should have this book and make it available to every employee."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This short read is great have on hand when wanting to improve customer service in your business.

It was worth the price, we actually got some good ideas out of it."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book was a pretty simplistic read, but contained some good ideas that encourage you to think about your own situation. We gave this book to our Building Permit and Citizen Complaints staff (who aren't the shiniest pennys in the well). It sparked them to think of ways to handle customers in a more positive manner and move service from 'OK' to 'Raving Fans'."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"This book exemplifies customer-focused action at its best. This book forges the term &quot;Do unto your customer as THEY would have YOU do unto THEM&quot;. Ken's writing style makes it a pleasure to read and hard to put down. Of course, with any of Blanchard's works, you expect quality, but Raving Fans shocks the reader into thinking, &quot;It's actually simple to please the customer, why don't I just follow these guidelines?&quot;Raving Fans reminds us that we all have customers, whether or not you have direct customer contact. The strategies presented will enable any one to identify the needs of their customer, exceed those needs at little or not monetary cost, and truly create Raving Fans."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"Many other reviewers of this book over simplify or trivialize the book because of their lack of understanding of the main points the book attempts to make which is getting customers to you establishment and getting them to stay. Too many times customers are disloyal to an organization because others provide them with something different. That is what this book attempts to have the reader do in thier own situation. Give them a reason to patronize your company.One such review tries to explain the profit margin of groceries stores, but who cares, it is an example of what a grocery store could use. As far as I know, no such store exsists. The point is that we need to change our perspective on what the customer wants not what we think they want.What these over trivializing reviewers fail to explain or understand is that the point of the book is to perform the best service you can so that you company can make a profit. This is why they are in business.The book is set to inspire the reader through an alagory so the reader can draw from it what they want and need for there company. Find out what you customers want is certainly not a bad idea, except most people do not capitalize on it do they?The book gets you think about what you want, waht the guest wants and give it to the in spades.This is a common sense approach to a long forgotten art and sets to inspire the reader to focus on the customer.This is a great book to give to the people who work on the front line of every company as a motivational tool only."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"I like the idea - focusing on good customer service. I don't like the way the book is written. Other books, like \\"Fish\\" (Stephen Lundin) do a better job of presenting a \\"moral through a story.\\" They are teaching something new or inventive. Good 'customer service' is not a new concept. Conveying its importance through a simplistic story is, in my opinion, rather elementary my dear Blanchard.If these fictional characters were real people, and some good facts were thrown in, this could be a very good book. As it is, I think there are better ways - and books - to promote good customer service in an organization.The only redeeming quality is it is a quick read and therefore if you want to line Ken Blanchard's pockets... you can buy copies for your entire team and perhaps inspire some thought and get everyone on the same page. Unless you have team-building in mind though... seek wisdom elsewhere."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"The one good thing you can say about this book is that it makes you think. Beyond that there is little to recommend it. It has a childish premise (Charlie the Fairy as an affirmative action hire - really??) and it reads like fiction. In some of the businesses it speaks about it is impossible to imagine the economics of what they are doing to satisfy customers working.If there were real companies and real case studies, that would be one thing, but there is no indication that any of this is real, and you have to face reality - people shop on price. Competition can kill your wonderful customer service organization if you are too expensive. Yet nowhere in the book is a whiff of the creativity needed to find things that create great customer service at a low cost.Well it is a breezy read, which would probably have fit in about 60 pages had the layout not been as childish as the presentation. There is probably some good advice in here, but the presentation is so bad, that I am almost unwilling to credit that it can be done."},{"Title":"Raving Fans","review":"The one good thing you can say about this book is that it makes you think.

RAVING FANS is a big success in providing you with simple instructions for making large strides toward achievable perfection. Imagining perfection is a critical first step to improvement, yet most people have never thought about what that could mean. Then testing that perfection with customers (and potential customers) must be done to be sure that there is a valid opportunity, and to be able to understand customers' ideas about achievable perfection. Then attaching the idea of continuous improvement toward that vision is also valuable, and useful. There are plenty of practical tips about how to do each part, which is key to making this book so valuable. One of the reasons that I enjoy writing reviews about books on-line is that I can find a RAVING FANS that agrees so much with my own perspective and research. This book will quickly get you past your Psychology of Disbelief, Bureaucracy, Procrastination, Communiation, and Ugly Duckling stalls.

Oh, don't get me wrong, there are several things in this book that I could use, although I might have to alter it a little. For someone that wants to go into massage therapy, I would suggest getting a few other books.

It wasn't until one of my elders read the book and told me what impact it had on his thoughts and attitudes of his daily walk, that I decided to pick up the small, but towering book of truth.CJ Mahaney has put together a very strong book that seems to come from the outworking of his previous works which focus on Christ and His cross. This seems as though it is the natural outflow of his writings on \\"Christ our Mediator\\" and also \\"The Cross Centered Life.\\" CJ comes to this conclusion and outworking by writing the book \\"Humility: True Greatness.\\"The book is broken into three parts:Part I: Our Greatest Friend, Our Greatest Enemy: The Battle of Humility Versus PrideIn this part CJ comes out and helps define what humility is and what pride is. He then walks through the implications, promises and perils of both.Part II: The Great Reversal: Our Saviour and the Secret of True GreatnessThis is classic Mahaney. Pointing us back to our Saviour. It is as although he has \\"defined\\" humility and pride in the first part he cannot truly define humility without coming back to the Saviour and the cross. Mahaney shows some ways that the Christ shows humility to his disciples in Mark 10 and also through the great redemptive plan in the cross. This is where you start to simply understand your need of humility to truly walk in the ways of Christ and this is where I started to ask, \\"give me some ways to understand this practically\\" and that is what Mahaney delivers in the third part of the book.Part III: Our Great Pursuit: The Practice of True HumilityMahaney really lays out some great practical ways to come to an understanding of humility in our lives and ways to see the pride in them as well. He lists out for most of the book, as this is by far the longest part, practical ways to be humble and ways to continually point out prideful parts in our lives.All in all, this is a very hard book practically to read, as I have found all of Mahaney's books to be, but very easy for any layman to pick up and walk through. Very challenging without being a cry from the high towers of holiness as this book is read and written through the eyes of someone you feel is having the very same struggles you are in the subject that is being written, yet someone who has much knowledge to share on how to \\"accomplish\\" the set thesis.I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to understand this subject, and if you feel you don't need to understand this subject...you really need to read this book, cause you are missing the point..."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Rather than defining one as humble or not as in binary mode, it is more appropriate to think in terms of degree of humility as some have more than the other. After all, there is no one who is perfect in humility anyway other than the King of kings who is also the king of servants, Jesus Christ. I have not met CJ personally but I have seen him speak at Resolved 2007. My impression from this book, however, he is someone who has biblically and experimentally studied and applied humility. Now to understand humility biblically is critical since there is no such thing as true humility apart from God's definition and the cross-centered foundation of it. This is the meat of this book which I value greatly, because CJ goes from the foundation of true humility without which no one can ever be humble, that is, the death and resurrection of Christ and being born again, to the evil of pride, to the inward applications on how to grow more in humility and less in pride, though I don't completely agree with all the steps he proposes, like playing golf; and outwardly in our treatment to others. The latter particularly sticks to my mind when it comes to seeing the grace of God in others, by which I take it to mean, to study and understand people objectively, to be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger. Only then can we know how to speak humbly to encourage or edify."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C. J.

In part one Mahaney discusses the promise of humility and the peril of pride. In part two he redefines greatness and shows how greatness can be demonstrated. Part three deals with the pursuit of humility, the importance of focus, evidences of grace, correction,responding to trials, and leaving a legacy.This is a book for pastors, church leaders, and individual Christians.

The author also provides good practical advice for any Christian on how to start and end the day with prayerful reflection and humility, accepting life's trials come what may.Obviously there are some minor theological differences in how I view and this author view God's nature (I'm lds and believe God the Father to be a tangible physical being and separate in being but one in purpose with the Holy Spirit and Christ).

Mahaney, popular author, pastor, and president of Sovereign Grace Ministries, states that the most important characteristic of \\"true greatness\\" is humility. In his book Humility, published in 2005, Mahaney reminds his readers of what it means to be truly great in the sight of God. Every Christian knows that humility is important. But far too few actively pursue humility in their own life. This book helps us to put our belief about humility into practice.The main point of Humility is that \\"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\\" Mahaney then expands on this theme throughout the 12 chapters in the book. The first four chapters are more theological in nature. Mahaney examines various verses in the Bible, reminding his readers of the promises of humility and the perils of pride. He also defines greatness according to the scriptures and gives biblical examples of what it means to be truly great in God's sight.Mahaney spends the last eight chapters giving practical advice on how to work on being truly great by growing your humility. He mentions various ways to start off your day that will help you grow in humility. He also gives advice on how to end each day being focused on true greatness. A very helpful exercise he mentions is to \\"identify the evidences of grace\\" in other people. This has been a very rewarding application in my own life. And he even adds humor, by telling his readers to spend time doing some things you're not good at just to encourage yourself to stay humble.I've found this book to be personally convicting in my life and leadership. I've recently had my leadership team read through the book. We spent time discussing Mahaney's insights on humility and how we should pursue true greatness together.If you're looking for a short, yet convicting book on the subject of true greatness, be sure to read Humility by C.

Although it is a quick read, the topic matter is deep and convicting. A great read and a great gift to pass on."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Only in the past two years have I known much about C. J. Mahaney. Much of what I have learned is a result of the wiki leaks this last year and the controversy surrounding his leave of absence from Sovereign Grace Ministries. These events played a role in me reading this book. I figured the guy who wrote a book on the subject of humility then stepped down to have his character examined, specifically the matter of humility, must take this characteristic and his character extremely seriously.After having read this book, I really feel like I've had a window into this man's heart. If you've gotten caught up in this controversial discussion about C. J. Mahaney, I encourage you to read this book before being swept away by a torrent of media that might bias your views of this man. Before deciding what we think of Mahaney, we need to see the presupposition under which he operates his Christian life. It is clear that the virtue of humility is cherished by him as it ought to by us all. It is also clear that when this character attribute of his is challenged, he does not take the challenge lightly. I appreciate they lengths at which he took in order to be tested and restored rightly.I actually read Humility in February just after my recent surgery. I was cooped up in bed for a couple of days, and it seemed like good timing to give this book a read. After having read the book, I heartily recommend this book to every Christian who desires to understand the attribute of humility and the role that it ought to play in each of our lives.According to Mahaney, \\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" In contrast to humility, Mahaney explains, \\"Pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of God and refuse to acknowledge their dependence upon Him.\\" Basically, Mahaney says that our pride is strong when we forget our place before God and try to usurp that place from Him. Mahaney continues, \\"That's the motive and ultimate purpose of pride - to rob God of legitimate glory and to pursue self-glorification, contending for supremacy with Him.\\" Humility is when we see ourselves the way God sees us, warts and all.The beauty of it all is that God loves through our sinfulness. We know this because God the Father sent God the Son, who willingly subjected Himself to death on the cross. Mahaney elaborates on the value of Christ's death in respect to the subject of humility,\\"Here's an essential truth: To learn true humility, we need more than a redefinition of greatness; we need even more than Jesus' personal example of humble service. What we need is His death...\\" Why was the death of Jesus necessary? Because all of humanity is corrupt and condemned, and we all have an acute tendency to deny the reality of our lost state before God.Without first being confronted by Christ's death and encountering the wonder of salvation we cannot walk in humility. Humility requires us to emulate and sacrifice like Christ did when he died, according to Mahaney this is true greatness. What I've just shared covers the material from Parts One and Two of this book. Those two parts help the reader have context for understanding the links between pride, greatness, and humility. Part Three is where Mahaney provides encouragement and methods for practicing humility. This section includes principles to practice at the beginning of the day, the end of the day, and also some special principles.As each day begins Mahaney challenges the reader to reflect on the wonder of the cross, to acknowledge our need for God, to give gratitude to God, and to practice spiritual disciplines. As an aside he recommends Don Whitney's book, Spiritual Discipline for the Christian Life, a book I am reading at present. Mahaney encourages those who wish to practice humility to take advantage of their commute and make it purposeful time with God. He also challenges the reader to cast their cares upon God.As the day ends Mahaney cautions the reader from committing cosmic plagiarism. This is when we take credit for what God does in our lives. He also encourages us to accept the gift of sleep, then close the day with expressing gratefulness for Christ's death and resurrection.As a special focus Mahaney encourages the reader to study the attributes of God, study the doctrine of grace, nbsp;and study the doctrine of sin.There are a bunch of nuggets to take away from this book. One of the most precious ones that I found was in Mahaney's chapter on encouraging others. This nugget has to do with correcting others. Mahaney says, \\"Never correct without reminding the individual, at some point, of the gospel. Any conversation including correction must also include the gospel, because biblical correction is incomplete apart from the gospel.\\" This observation of his is absolutely the best snapshot of this book. Always at the center of humility is a message, action, or lifestyle centered on the gospel. This is how it should be. When we rise Christ's resurrection is on our hearts and in our morning prayers. When we walk we proclaim the fulfilled promise of our Savior. When we lay our head down, we rest peacefully in the hands that were pierced for our transgressions, remembering the cost he paid for so great a salvation.Once again, I recommend reading this book. Then a couple of months after having read it, re-acquaint yourself with the book and review your notes. That is what I did this evening, and it refreshed my soul.View more book reviews by Joey Cochran at jtcochran.com."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This book is a hard one to read.

I found it to be a little bit over my head, but I think the principles are something that I should study over time."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C. J. Mahaney has done it again. He has written three other books that have all hit the mark in terms of insightful teaching that is characterized by fidelity to the Bible and practical application to life today (his others are: The Cross-Centered Life; Christ, Our Mediator; Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God). Humility: True Greatness is no different. Here he brings to light the Scripture's teaching on the damning sinfulness of pride, and the glorious attractiveness of humility. The book contains the following chapters:Part 1: Our Greatest Friend, Our Greatest Enemy- The Promise of Humility- The Perils of PridePart 2: The Great Reversal- Greatness Redefined- Greatness DemonstratedPart 3: Our Great Pursuit- As Each Day Begins- As Each Day Ends- For Special Focus- Identifying Evidences of Grace- Encouraging Others- Inviting and Pursuing Correction- Responding Humbly to Trials- A Legacy of Greatness- A Final Word- How to Weaken Pride and Cultivate Humility: A List of SuggestionsThis book should be required reading for every Christian. Sadly today, our churches and larger denominational ministries foster a sense of pride and achievement. We must recover an understanding of true greatness if we want to see victory in the Christian life and true revival in our generation.Although, he would certainly deny it (as is clear, if you have ever had the privilege of hearing him speak) Mahaney himself is truly a humble man, and I believe that is one of the reasons he has been so mightily used by God. Buy the book, and get started learning humility."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"There is a certain irony in the pursuit of humility. We see a glimpse of that in the title of this book, Humility: True Greatness. Humility is true greatness. The pursuit of humility and the pursuit of greatness are one and the same, provided that we seek greatness as defined by the Creator. I have never met C.J. Mahaney (though hope to some day), but from all accounts he is well-qualified to write a book on such a difficult subject. And this is a difficult topic. After all, how can a person write a book on humility without sounding like he feels he is most qualified? The truth is he can, provided he uses the Scripture as the foundation for his teaching. And that is exactly what Mahaney does.The book is divided into three sections. Part one deals with the battle of humility versus pride, part two with our Savior and the secret of true greatness and part three with the practice of true humility.In the first part, Mahaney defines humility and shows how true humility is nothing less than a battle against the pride that lives deep within every heart. \\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in the light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" These two realities must be the foundation of any definition of humility: our sinfulness and God's holiness. This is precisely why true greatness can only be achieved by followers of Jesus Christ, for only they have had their eyes opened by the Holy Spirit to see the depth of their own depravity and the overwhelming holiness of God.Mahaney teaches, rightly I believe, that God hates the sin of pride above all other sin. This is a sin that plagues all humans, though it manifests itself in different ways. So the issue facing the believer is he examines his life is not if pride is present, but where it is present. For most of us it is deeply ingrained in our lives and only a great amount of Spirit-guided self-examination can draw it to the surface.In the second part, Mahaney defines greatness as Jesus did, showing that being great means being a servant to everyone. Just as Jesus came to serve, so must we serve with our lives. Christ lived as the perfect example of humble service. As in all his books, Mahaney leads the reader to the cross, stating that apart from Christ's sacrifice, there is no serving. We can only attain true greatness by emulating Christ's example - the example that led him to the cross where He made the greatest sacrifice.In the third and final part of the book Mahaney builds on the foundation he has built through Scripture to provide advice on the practice of humility. This is far more than a bullet list of do's and don'ts. It is far more than a false, monastic humility that is really no humility at all. Instead, he examines several different areas of life and shows how humility can be applied to all of them. From the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep (and even while we are asleep) we can practice humility. Whether we experience joy or pain, whether we are correcting or being corrected, we all have opportunities to practice humility every day.Humility: True Greatness is a truly great book. I do not know of a person who shows no pride in his life, and thus I do not know of a person who would not benefit from reading it. I highly and unreservedly recommend this book. I pray that it will be widely-read, that humility may be widely-practiced."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C.J. Mahaney's latest book, Humility: True Greatness, is an amazing challenge to believers to think seriously about how much weight God has placed on humility. The challenge of this book springboards from Isaiah 66:2, \\"This is the one whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.\\" As the title hints at, Mahaney has put together a concise and practical book that calls us to seek humility, which is how God defines true greatness.The author has a clear, yet personable writing style and Humility is a prime example. He tackles such topics as defining biblical humility (\\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" p. 22) and pride (\\"Pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of God and refuse to acknowledge their dependence upon Him.\\" p. 31).Mahaney also does a wonderful job giving practical encouragements of how to foster humility in our daily lives: through prayer, acting in grace toward others, and opening oneself up for correction. There is even a checklist summary of practical things we can do to strive after humility at the end of the book.Of course, a lot more could have been written, but an exhaustive manifesto on humility does not seem to be Mahaney's ambition. Rather, this excellent book is a crisp, if not humble, approach to a hugely important topic in the life of a Christ-follower.All in all, Mahaney has hit another home run. I can't imagine any believer not being challenge by this convicting and gracious book. He has such an accessible style that many readers will be able to devour Humility in one sitting. I would recommend that you go at a slower pace and let these powerful challenges transform your life. In fact, I've already bought several copies that I have been doling out to my coworkers. Thanks C.J. - please keep books like this coming! - Todd Burgett, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I thought, wow, this is going to be a great book.I wasn't prepared for what I got.A book that broke me, that had me on my knees, that used the word of God to pierce between my joints and marrow.Flawless theology, intensely practical, powerfully written.I feel I do the book an injustice by trying to describe or summarize it at all, so a sentence from the epilogue will do:Ultimately, there can be no effective expansion of your life's mission and ministry, no fulfillment of the specific purpose He's called you to, apart from the cultivation of humility in your heart and the weakening of pride in your life.Let this book be a tool that the Spirit uses to expose the pervasiveness and perversity of pride in your life and challenge you to turn in humility and repentance to a gracious God."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"The premise of C.J. Mahaney's new book Humility: True Greatness is from a quote by John Stott that says \\"At every stage of our Christian development and in every sphere of our Christian discipleship, pride is the greatest enemy and humility our greatest friend.\\" Mahaney takes the sin of pride very seriously and sees the solution to it as equally imperative.Being one of the founders of Sovereign Grace Ministries and the author of several other devotional books that are graced with endorsements by Al Mohler, Jerry Bridges Ligon Duncon, Mark Dever, and Wayne Grudem, Mahaney has much to be proud of; but he doesn't think so. Following his foundational principles laid down in his book The Cross-Centered Life Mahaney contends true humility is cultivated at Calvary \\"beholding the lamb of God.\\" This, he avers, transforms the self-confident into humble servants for the glory of God, and thus makes the strongest, most insightful point in the book.After delineating some helpful teaching on the nature of pride, humility, and the power of the gospel Mahaney spends middle section of his book developing a number of strategies that he believes will nurture seeds of humbleness planted in the sojourning saint. He recommends studying the transcendent attributes of God (omniscience, onimpotence, omnipresence), the nature of sin (according to John Owen), and \\"the Doctrines of Grace\\" (Calvinism). Though he does not say explicitly, the implication, at least in this area, that non-Calvinists cannot truly cultivate humility looms in the background-a truly fictitious notion when one examines the lives of such saints as D.L Moody and Billy Graham. This was the weaker portion of the book.Beyond that he spends an excessive amount of ink on habits of piety that require as much humility to practice as they produce. Things like rising early to worship God, memorizing Scripture while stuck in traffic, thanking God for sleep (!), inviting correction, and encouraging others are all part of the game plan for developing an unassuming, self-effacing character. These are wonderful things, of course, but problematic to teaching humility like this, however, is that they assume what they are trying to yield: humility. However, I only say this speaking from my own futile experience and don't claim to have a corner on the \\"how to\\" when it comes to refining a humble character, so readers of this review would do well to take my words with a grain of salt.Mahaney does break in with his sense of humor, however. The suggestion of playing lots of golf made me laugh out loud with hearty agreement. At this point Mahaney shines with his commitment to not taking himself too seriously, which is most commendable.He ends the book with some very helpful chapters on humbly engaging trials suffering by looking at the text of Habakkuk, and raising humble children.I cannot say this book is the best on humility and pride. Andrew Murray and CS Lewis have communicated it in more poetic terms mixing good doctrine with mystery that resonate more with the soul. Even so, Mahaney does provide a nice field manual for those in his Reformed Baptist heritage, and it is not surprising to see the endorsements come from this tradition."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I just finished reading Humility: True Greatness by C.J. Mahaney. Now I hope you recognize immediately the need for humility when practicing evangelism. Often times, those with whom we want to share our faith are proud, self-righteous, and independant--and it would to little good to return pride with pride! God, in the Bible, over and over again reminds us of the need to stay humble and the consequence of such. See the following references for just a few examples: James 4:6, 1 Peter 5:5, Isaiah 66:2, Proverbs 8:13, Proverbs 6:16-17, Proverbs 16:18, Mark 9:35, Mark 10:32-45, Mark 10, Philippians 2:6-11,It should be clear to the reader that no one can be a self-proclaimed expert on this topic. It is clear that shouting \\"I'm way more humble than you are!\\" is self-defeating. Mahaney acknowledges this--he admits he is a proud person. It is only the proud person who acknowledges his pride that is qualified to write on humility. It is only due to Mahaney's failures in being humble that he can write about the need to be humble.Humility: True Greatness is not a probing theological book nor a deeply spiritual text. It is short and sweet, beginning with a few chapters on the necessity of humility and proceeding with several chapters of practical advice on how to live out a God-pleasing life of humility.One thing that I greatly appreciated was Mahaney's high view in chapter four of the death of Christ. Christ died not merely to demonstrate the ultimate in humility, but for us also to be humbled by dying with him and then being exalted because of him. He ransomed us--sorry, captive to sin, miserable and helpless. However, at this point, it seemed that Mahaney should explicitly explain the doctrine of Christ's substitutionary atonement. For readers not clear, to know this doctrine is crucial--that Christ suffered and died primarily to take the punishment we deserved for our many sins, and to credit to us his righteousness that we could never achieve. He endured in three hours on the cross our eternity in hell, and thus saved us that we might be forgiven and be made right with God. This doctrine is key to Mahaney's point in the first half of the book yet he assumes we know it. Still, Mahaney's resolute passion to write of the cross, the cross, and the cross is needed and appreciated.The practical chapters (starting in chapter five) almost alternate between general practical pracitices--such as setting aside time to pray in the morning and evening, or to study the attributes of God--and specific, almost quirky ways, like a recommendation to play golf, today's most humbling sport. This light though not comedic approach makes the book a breath of fresh air--I felt like I was getting friendly advice on how to live out the Christian life, rather than hardcore teaching from an authority. I don't think 400 pages of this would be any more edifying than the 120 that has been presented--Mahaney knows when to keep it shortThere is a section in Chapter 9 about using appropriate words that I thought were particularly fitting for witnessing. 1 Thessalonians 5:14 gives us a hint to \\"admonish, encourage, help, and be patient\\" to certain people (read the verse and learn who). Mahaney directs us better to consider the needs of those we meet, not trying to impress them or convert them, but rather listening sincerely and humbly to determine their need. The purpose of your words should be to give grace to those who hear (Ephesians 4:29). Another direction, especially when witnessing to those who claim to be Christians (and may indeed be) is to never correct another wihtout reminding the person of the gospel--because correction is impossible without Christ as the corrector.Mahaney also urges us to invite others to correct us and to seek correction. I pray and ask that you hold me accountable for the things on my site.This book is highly recommended, and it will not take you long to read. Take a few hours over two days and read Humility: True Greatness and you will receive \\"grace to the humble.\\""},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Though Humility: True Greatness is small, its depth and impact are big. It's accessible but profound, rooted in Scripture yet intensely practical. And there isn't a single one of us who couldn't benefit from its message. As Mahaney points out:\\"The sad fact is that none of us are immune from the logic-defying, blinding effects of pride. Though it shows up in different forms and to differing degrees, it infects us all.\\"Mahaney begins by making the case for how crucial this topic really is. He then takes a unique angle that I really appreciated. I always thought pursuing humility was important simply because the opposite, pride, was so abominable. But although Mahaney doesn't mince words about the seriousness of pride, he also turns attention to the positive: Humility is something to cultivate because of the promise it offers (\\"God gives grace to the humble\\"), not just because of the curse its alternative brings.Mahaney's self-deprecating humor and honesty about his own struggles with pride make him relatable and credible. He often anticipated my questions and objections with powerful illustrations of pride in his own life. And his disclaimers that he's unqualified to write a book about humility, combined with his friends' and family's endorsements of his humble spirit, only add to his credibility.More than once, he caught me with a direct hit--describing my prideful thoughts or heart attitudes with startling exactness. Yet Mahaney isn't out to beat you down and discourage you. Part of the beauty of the book is the thread of the gospel woven throughout. Over and over, he brings you back to the grace and mercy of the cross.One of the most powerful things I learned from this book was that having a correct definition of \\"greatness\\" and a perfect example to follow (Jesus) is not enough for me to attain humility. I can't be great unless I imitate Christ...but I can't imitate Christ apart from the cross. Only Christ's death--His sacrifice to ransom us from sin--will set us free from pride and enable us to be humble. Understanding that is the key to toppling pride. It all comes back to the cross--the foundation of Mahaney's life and ministry and the core of this book.Once he has laid the theological groundwork, Mahaney gets extremely practical. Pride must be actively fought; humility must be intentionally cultivated. This character development isn't just going to happen as we read the book--it's going to take work. So the second half of the book lays out specific steps to take--at the beginning and end of each day, throughout the day, and occasional practices. Each chapter challenged and inspired me.This book was a crucial one for me--one I know I'll need to read more than once. There are a lot of ways you could spend ten dollars, but I'm confident that spending it on this book will be a powerful way for you to invite God to shape you more into the image of His humble Son."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"A couple of weeks ago I finished reading C.J. Mahaney's Humility: True Greatness. I've been thinking about reviewing it but I wasn't sure how to share about how this little book addresses the big problem of pride. It is simple and easy-to-read but is addresses well the deep sickness of sin in our hearts and presents God's desire for us to be humble before Him. This book is convicting and encouraging, meditative and practical. Time spent reading this book would be edifying and worthwhile for anyone.\\"This is the one to whom I will look:he who is humble and contrite in spiritand trembles at My word.\\"Isaiah 66:2I agree with C.J's description of this verse-\\"astonishing.\\" How amazing that God, the Creator of the universe will look upon fallen and sinful people. This verse is also sobering because God does oppose the proud (James 4:6) and they are an abomination to Him (Proverbs 16:5). He writes, \\"Pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of God and refuse to acknowledge their dependence upon Him.\\" (p. 31) and \\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" (p. 22). This is why we need to be in the habit of studying and obeying His Word. When we are lowly and humble we can see more clearly how great and deserving He is.C.J. does a good job in warning his readers to heed conviction of sin and to be sensitive to weak areas where we are prone to pride. My favorite part of this book was where he gave advice on some habits that would beneficial in the quest to winning over pride in our lives. These two really encouraged me to work on them daily in my own battle against pride and striving for humility.-Begin Your Day Acknowledging Your Need For God.In this section he wrote about how the sin of pride is active. When we allow ourselves to be undisciplined for just a moment, it can creep in and taint our thoughts. He quotes Martin Lloyd-Jones who wrote, \\"Have you realized that most of your unhappiness in life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself?\\" C.J. reflects on this profound statement:Most of us spend more time listening to lies than we do speaking the truth to ourselves. And the listening process usually starts as soon as we get up. The alarm has rudely interrupted the gift of sleep, and the listening begins. As we stumble through our morning routine,we're not directing our thoughts in our mind-we're simply at their mercy. We're not in charge of our thinking. We're just there.But instead, you can declare war on pride by speaking the truth to yourself and set the right tone for your day by mentally affirming your dependence on God and your need for Him.p. 69-70-Identifying Evidences of Grace.C.J. explained why identifying evidence of God's grace in other's lives will help cultivate humility in my own heart-\\"This means actively looking for ways that God is at work in the lives of other people.\\" He encouraged the reader to become very familiar with the lists of fruits of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23, gifts of the Spirit in Romans 12:6-8 and 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 and to then be on the lookout for the Spirit's working in other's lives so that we can become more aware of what God is doing around us and not proudly focus on ourselves.Throughout the book, C.J. presents a beautiful image of humility as being void of anger or bitterness, being God-centered and a servant to others. He helped me remember that pride can be blind and so I need to be open to hear correction from others, especially in areas where I am possibly blinded by pride in my own heart. This book gave me a whole new perspective on the seriousness of pride and the decay it promotes in my heart and life. I am thankful that by God's grace, He will continue to change me to be lowly and tremble at His Word."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"In his endorsement of the book Mark Dever says \\"If you are struggling with pride you should read this book, if you are not strugglinh with pride, you definitely should read this book.\\" I didn't need much convincing to let me know I was prideful, but as I read \\"Humility: True Greatness\\", I began to see how much pride ecompassed every aspect of my life.C.J. Mahaney's very biblical and practical approach to combatting pride is extremely beneificial and life-changing. There are many ideas expressed in ways that completely hit the mark. To think when we act in pride, when we place our own interests above others, when we fail to trust God and instead rely on our own weak selves we are contending for His supremacy!Please read this book and let the word of God pierce your heart, reveal your sin, and watch the Spirit change You into His image!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C. J. Mahaney's Humility is a much-needed book for this generation of Christ-followers. I have a confession: Having recently read Andrew Murrary's classic of the same title, I was not expecting much from this book. No offense to Mahaney, for whom I have great respect, but I just couldn't imagine a book impacting me more on this topic than Murray's. To my delight (and conviction), Mahaney delivered a fantastic work that puts flesh on the topic of humility and provides concrete, practical steps to becoming people of humility. Obviously, Mahaney's book will be more accessible for this generation because his language is modern and his examples are fresh and referenced to contemporary culture.The book begins with a discussion on the battle between pride and humility and then demonstrates how Christ re-defined what it meant to be great. The last part, which comprises the bulk of the book, gives readers practical ideas for increasing their dependence upon Christ and therefore increasing in humility: spiritual disciplines for the morning and evening, Bible study ideas, ways to encourage others, the importance of accountability, etc. There was even a chapter on raising children who understand and strive for the Biblical greatness found in humility.As I read this book, I underlined a lot, jotted down many notes in the margin, implemented some of the principles, and discovered an idea for my next personal Bible study. I felt the chapter on practices for the end of the day would have been more developed if it included a more in-depth explanation of self-examination disciplines such as the Ignatian examen, and I disagree slightly with some of Mahaney's doctrinal positions, but this is definitely a book worth reading and recommending.This would make an excellent book for small groups to study."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend it for anyone who needs or wants to be more humble. It has broadened my prospective not only as a Christian but as a recovering alcoholic.

This a true MaHaney masterpice!Sincerely,Lisa Knizek"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C.J. Mahaney is such a man of passion. It truly shows in his writing. I could feel the passion with which he was writing and speaking the words from his book.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about their walk with Christ!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This truly is a humbling book, in the best and most positive sense of the word.It helps us see how habitually rooted we are in ourselves.\\"Aha\\" moments include the premises that comparing ourselves to others is pride, and that pride is contesting for supremacy with God.I breathe a hearty \\"Amen\\" to author Mahaney's statement that \\"True greatness is attained only by emulating the Savior's example--and made possible only by the Savior's sacrifice.\\""},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Nothing escapes God's notice, but one thing captures His gaze.Isaiah 66:1-2 says, \\"Thus says the Lord: \`Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what is the house that you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest? All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the Lord. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.' (ESV)The first several chapters of this book deal with defining humility and pride:\\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" (pg. 22)\\"Pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of God and refuse to acknowledge their dependence on Him.\\" (pg. 31)John MacArthur makes the sad observation that pride has become something of an \\"accepted\\" sin. It is something that we all struggle with, to one degree or another. \\"The real issue here is not if pride exists in your heart; it's where pride exists and how pride is being expressed in your life.\\" (pg. 29)Of course, God hates all sin. But, as Mahaney notes, \\"from God's perspective, pride seems to be the most serious sin.\\" (pg. 30) God passionately hates pride, and actively opposes the proud. But, He gives grace to the humble (see James 4:6, and 1 Peter 5:5). In light of this truth, shouldn't we, as believers, be actively seeking to eradicate pride and pursue humility?Ask yourself this question:\\"How, for the rest of my life, can I deliberately and diligently mortify pride, and pursue humility on a daily basis?\\"The majority of this book is given to simple, practical, and most importantly, biblical advice on how to answer this question. I found chapters 5 and 6 especially helpful, as Mahaney gives suggestions for meditation \\"As Each Day Begins\\" (ch. 5) and \\"As Each Day Ends\\" (ch. 6). He also suggests several ideas for going beyond our daily studies, and into times of extended concentration and study in chapter 7 (\\"For Special Focus\\").The other chapters are just as helpful, as they encourage us to be:~Identifying Evidences of Grace (ch. 8 ) - In other words, actively \\"looking for ways that God is at work in the lives of other people.\\" (pg. 98)~Encouraging Others (ch. 9)~Inviting and Pursuing Correction (ch. 10)~Responding Humbly to Trials (ch. 11)This book comes highly recommended by pastors, authors, and professors...men like Randy Alcorn, Jerry Bridges, Mark Dever, Ligon Duncan, Wayne Grudem, Joshua Harris, John MacArthur, and Al Mohler. While I enjoyed each one's thoughts, and agree with their recommendations, I thought that Mark Dever said it best,\\"If you're fighting pride - like I am - you should read it, too. And if you're not fighting pride, you really need to read it!\\""},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Mr. Mahaney does a wonderful job of describing and detailing what humility is and how that should look in a Christians life. C.J. has the gift of relating things that are deep in a very pragmatic, easy-to-read and understand kind of way.

I especially loved the chapters on how he teaches his son about humility."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I'm impressed with this book and its approach. The author has a way of expressing his ideas that elicit further thought about the subject from the reader.

Mahaney starts of by discussing why humility is important--including a little info from a survey that showed meekness and hard work were prevalent in successful business leaders.This is a short and easy read. Mahaney not only discusses Humility but also gives pointers on cultivating it (e.g. playing golf ;P)."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I need this book. In fact, I believe every Christian needs to read C.J. Mahaney's book on humility. And not just once, but several times. At least once a year.Humility: True Greatness (Multnomah, 2006) is one of the most practical, pastorally helpful books I've ever read. For this reason, I find myself coming back to it every few months or so.C.J. will tell you up front that Humility is not written by an expert on humility. He confesses that he is \\"a proud man pursuing humility by the grace of God\\" (13). But it is precisely because C.J. acknowledges his weakness that he is able to write so effectively on the subject of humility.Here is how C.J. defines humility: \\"honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness\\" (22). Bouncing back and forth between these \\"twin poles,\\" C.J. spends the first two sections laying out the perils of pride and the way in which Jesus redefined success and greatness. The final section of the book focuses on the daily cultivation of humility and the deliberate weakening of pride.C.J. points out the subtle ways in which pride gains a foothold in our lives. He shows how pride leads to bitterness. He reminds us of the cost of our salvation, always pointing us back to the cross.I have benefited most from C.J.'s advice to seek out \\"evidences of grace\\" in other people. We are tempted to criticize and find problems with everyone else. But C.J. calls us to look for the evidences of God's grace in others. This practice curbs our prideful tendencies and increases humility.Rarely do I read books that manage to be both deeply theological and immensely practical. Humility: True Greatness deserves a place on every pastor's bookshelf. If you think you don't need it, you are probably one who needs it most. So put it on your bookshelf, but never let it get too far from your desk."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"As a pastor, I am always on the lookout for books that help not only myself, but others. This was the first book by Mahaney that I ever read and I loved it. The book reads like a sermon from a caring pastor, who himself is more than willing to be vulnerable.It contains not only sufficient biblical discussion of Humility to edify, but it aims for practical applications also.What comes through the loudest is Mahaney's reliance on the grace of God for all things, including walking in humility. I have given this book to many. I recommend to all Christians and probably need to read it again and again myself. So, don't just buy one copy! Get one to share."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I just finished reading Humility and it one of the rare books that I am sad to finish. It was a deeply challenging book that I wish every Christian would read and I am certain that every Christian would benefit from.Mahaney defines Humility as \\"honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" I found that definition to be powerful. It was a humbling experience to be forced to realize that because of my sinfulness I deserve death and hell, that is what I deserve yet God has chosen to show me grace and mercy through the Cross of His Son. So when I look at all the good in my life I am forced to confess that I can take credit for none of it. It is all simply an opportunity to praise the goodness of my great God.Two of Mahaney's strengths shine in this book; he is always a gracious and is open about his own struggles. The book is not written as a learned treatise from a man who portrays himself as a paradigm of humility, rather as a shared education from a proud man pursuing humility urging us to join him in that pursuit.Mahaney is also intensely practical. Throughout the book there is guidance on how to cultivate the attitude of humility. I found especially helpful his guidance on how to start the day and I am already benefiting from it. He advises that we should begin each day acknowledging our dependence on God and expressing gratefulness to Him. There is a great deal of practical guidance of this nature throughout the book. But starting the day in this fashion has changed the nature of how I face the obstacles of the day, how I approach the appointments and duties of each day, they are no longer seen as opportunities to work or to accomplish things or even simply to do what must be done; but rather as opportunities to rest in God's strength and to see Him at work.I commend this book to you and all the work of C. J. Mahaney. May God Bless him and preserve him so that he can continue to be a conduit of blessing to the church."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"The book is a swift and easy read, the first time through. Once you put it down you have to pick it back up and then study it, in depth, and try to soak its truths deep into your heart. The shadow a true Christian should cast is one of real love and humility and C.J. Mahaney teaches one the importance of it, how Jesus IS humility, and how we need to live like Him.Loved it, and am busy trying to pursue Humility, True Greatness."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Humility is not a bestselling topic. In a world that celebrates pride, achievement, and the success and glory of individuals, it is difficult to convince many that greatness lies in reverence. In his book, \\"Humility, True Greatness,\\" C.J. Mahanney gives us hope that humility still has its value. He makes clear in his introduction his qualifications for writing this book.\\"I'm a proud man pursuing humility by the grace of God. I don't write as an authority on humility. I write as a fellow pilgrim walking with you on the path set before us by our humble savior.\\"This book is very practical. Mahanney starts out writing of the dangers of pride and the blessings of living humbly. He then describes how not only the Bible but also the examples of corporate America show that it is most often driven leaders that \\"were self-effacing and modest\\" who rose to the top. Even more rewarding is the concept that \\"humility draws down the gaze of [...] God,\\" but that it takes God to practice genuine humility.In the second half of this book, Mahanney suggests to the reader how to practice this journey to pursue humility. Chapters include \\"As Each Day Begins,\\" \\"As Each Day Ends,\\" \\"Identifying Evidences of Grace,\\" and \\"Encouraging Others,\\" and each gives great stories and examples to cultivate a life of humility and more vivid understanding of its presence in daily living.Mahanney finishes the book describing the legacy of greatness left behind after a life of humility, and gives us a list of suggestions to reference as we seek to apply these ideas to our lives.After listening to a pastor give an address to his congregation on the topic of \\"Finding Joy in Humility\\" (Pastor Mark Driscoll, Mars Hill Church, Seattle), I remembered his reference of Mahanney's book, and used the power of Amazon.com to acquire my own copy right away. The book has a lot to offer to anyone who might open up their heart to the principle that is guaranteed to lead to true greatness."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Short, consise, well-versed, advice on living a life of humility, not as the world sees it (weakness, shyness), but as seen through the eyes of God. True greatness is achieved through true humility.And C.J. Mahaney systematically lays out a blueprint for God's plan for our life. God's plan; not our plan. This is the key to understanding true humility; understanding that we must be servants, as Christ demonstrated, in order to remain on the path that God has chosen for us.Are you willing to lay all at the foot of God in order to let him transform you in to a creature that is successful; at home, at work, at play. God wants success for his people, but he desires humility.A continual reference to one key point in this book is that God gives grace to the humble. Well, as we all know, God's grace is all we have to begin with because we are nothing without him, but now we see that there is something that we can do to draw God's gaze and bring grace to our lives. What a true relief. Through true biblical humility, we can attract God's gaze, draw his attention and receive blessings beyond which we have already, through grace, received. How humbling, how encouraging, how exciting!I have suffered many setbacks in my life, inlcuding 10 years in darkness after I turned my back on God, but this book, the first that I read when I truly dedicated my life to the Lord, has led to such a great understanding of what God has for us, for me.C.J. Mahaney uses real-life analogies and stories to relate the message that is repeated throughout God's word, and he backs all of that up with scripture.I cannot more highly recommend a life changing book, especially for a new Christian; this book will provide the foundation for all future endeavors in your life in God's will. This book helped me to understand that I was self-centered, egocentric and selfish; even with my wife and daughters who I love and thought I would do anything for. It helped me to find the places, deep inside, that I needed to change in order to effectively humble myself in every facet of my life.I still suffer trials, to be honest, I feel that I suffer more since I became a true Christian, but I see them as a blessing, a gift, an opportunity for me to, as it says in James, grow in faith. James 1:2-3 (not referenced in the book, but so very valid here) states; \\"Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance\\" (NIV). What an encouragement! What a blessing! GRACE!!!Please, read this book. The chapters are short enough for a devotional period and the results, if you are receptive to God's word, are remarkable.Humility, despite what the world believes, is the key to happiness both here and in the hereafter."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Ok, so it's not quite that simple, nor does the book claim that. However reading this book has given me a fresh prespective and desire for humility. As someone who is now striving for humility as well, I highly recommend this book. I learned of this book while listing to a podcasted sermon on humilty. The pastor was not one who often expressed the gift of humilty and he stated that much of his message came from this book. So there you go!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"As I have observed with all of CJ's books and teaching, this book shows the marks of the Spirit producing a man after God's own heart.This book was probably one of the shortest books I have read in a long time, but it may prove to be one of the most influential on me during this season of my life. Being one of the guys who Collin Hansen's CT article described as Young Restless and Reformed, I have seen an increasing love for theology and the Sovereignty of God, yet a disconnect between a theology that emphasizes God's grace as so supreme and a lack of humility like the force of my attitude is truly what is in control. CJ's book was very helpful to put a more accurate frame how I see my life and the lives of others. \\"I am not a humble man, but a proud one, but I am a man who by God's grace am pursuing humility.\\"Oh how if each of us could get a tiny grasp of this in our own lives, how much more God glorifying would our interactions be with one another, even over hotly debated theological topics.Thanks CJ for the courage to write this book. May God blow his breath on it to do many things to make Jesus look good!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I have not finished this book yet, but I am close. The author writes in such a way that makes the reader feel as if he is setting with the him having a down-to-earth discussion on practicing humility. This is the first book I have purchased authored by CJ Mahaney and I plan on checking out some of his other works."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C. J. Mahaney echoes biblical truth: God helps the humble. He exposes the subtlety of pride and the wide range of ways in which it manifests itself in us all. Because pride is a problem which never really leaves us and one which causes God to oppose us, Mahaney's excellent effort in this brief book is worthy of an annual reading."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This is a short and insightful look at Biblical humility. Highly recommended. As the Bible speaks of humility very often as a mark of a Christ follower, this book is a great study on a deeper level."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"The dangers of pride cannot be overstated. It leads us to seek glory for ourselves rather than to exalt the majesty of God. It poisons our relationships with others and leads to harsh treatment of our neighbors. A person infected with pride will cause harm to himself and the surrounding world. It would be best to simply avoid such a condition. The problem, however, is that we are all plagued by pride. It is the enemy of our soul, and yet it is part of us! What are we to do?Within his book, C.J. Mahaney addresses the issue of pride in the life of a believer. The book's foundation rests upon Isaiah 66:2: \\"This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.\\" Where pride is our greatest enemy, humility is our greatest friend. Each chapter of the book walks the reader through a great reversal of thought. Success and greatness is not found through prideful advancement, but through a humble dependence on the grace of God.The book is quite short in length and can be read in one sitting, but the application will last for much longer. Many of the chapters are devoted to the practical cultivation of humility in everyday life. The results are also chronicled. Believers are encouraged to look for God's grace in the lives of others rather than complain about deficiencies. Joyfulness and gratefulness are cultivated as discontentment is curbed. The book is a great read on the subject of humility and worthy of investment."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Awesome look at ways to be humble in a Godly fashion. The book takes a deep dive in ways to confess our meekness toward God, so he can shine through us."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Yesterday I read C.J. Mahaney's book on Humility. It cuts to the bones and marrows. It is loaded with truth. It was like a gift of God to me -- first because of the content's impact on my soul, second because it cost me only $4.2Like any American book written by an American it says exactly what you have to do (practical application) in order to achieve true humility. No walking in circles. Straight to the point. There is a list in the end of the book where you can see some steps on how to weaken pride and cultivate humility:1. Reflect on the wonders of the Cross2. Begin your day by acknowledging your dependence on God and your need for God.3. Begin your day by expressing gratefulness to God.4. Practice spiritual disciplines -- prayer, study of God's word, worship. Do this consistently each day and at the day's outset, if possible.5. Seize your commute time to memorize and meditate on Scripture.6. Cast your cares upon Him, for He cares for you.There are 11 more maxims like that on his list. In general it is a very useful book. I found many things that I will apply in my spiritual walk with the Lord. However I found some things that upset me. Except for the story of Israel's exodus from Egypt and Habakkuk's story(a great lesson for me) I didn't find any more examples from the lives of people of God from the Old Testament. I also didn't quite get the idea of telling to people that you are not humble and writing the book on humility. I understand that no one is perfect here in this world apart from Jesus. But how come that Apostle Paul could say in his epistle to Thessalonians that \\"...we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children\\" (1Th.2:7), to Corinthians \\"...truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.\\" (2Co.12:12) and more like these: \\"...wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.\\" (1Co.4:16) and same message to Philippians: \\"...Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.\\"(Phil..3:17)I understand that none of us can say -- I am humble, imitate me. But why in explanations on why C.J. wouldn't like to pastor the church at Corinth he states: \\"Why? Because I'm proud. And only those who are humble can consistently identify evidences of grace in others who need adjustment. It's something the proud and the self-righteous are incapable of.\\"( p.100) It can be understood in 2 senses. Sense number 1: \\"No I am relatively humble, I pastured the church for 30 years, and gave advices to people.\\" Or like this: \\"Yes, I'm proud, nevertheless God allows me to adjust the lives of others even in my imperfect state.\\" I just didn't get the irony, sorry.Together with that there are many quotes, many references to the outside sources. So you will learn not only what C.J. thinks on humility, but also Calvin, Spurgeon, Edwards, Henry, Owen, Watson and some other less known scholars. Also as a minus to this book I would attribute absence of the example of Jesus' washing the disciples' feet. Why? There is an illustration of something close to that on the cover, but not a word about that radical way of Jesus showing the \\"practical approach\\" on what it means to be humble.Other than that the book is great. Some examples really shocked or at least amazed me, like for instance \\"Eric a successful businessman who volunteers each Sunday at our church parking cars.\\"(p.45) That's an amazing example of humility. Or that funny example in Chapter 10 of that Armani suited businessman who eats at the caf&eacute; and goes to his meeting with a blob of cream cheese in his groomed mustache.In conclusion I want to say that this book gives a very good motivation to walk humbly with your God. It gives enough examples both from Scriptures and American life. It moves you to change your habits. It points to the fact that you yourself cannot overcome pride -- our all faces are in cream cheese so to speak. It is much easier to read than unabridged Puritan classics. The book is very timely, very strategic, very much to the point and American."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"It is almost a challenge to pick this book up just because you know within the covers of it are many more good and fruitful challenges. I highly enjoyed the book and actually did a book review of it for one of my classes! humility is a humbling thing! go for it folks! thanks amazon!!!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Destined to become a minor classic (\\"minor\\" because of its limited scope), Mahaney's little book on humility has become the go-to book for a simple-but-profound study of the topic of humility. It's structured topically, as opposed to a more biblical theology approach, and is especially excellent to read with a small group.This was the second time I had read it, and this time was with my pastor and two young men we're mentoring. The discussion based on the book was very good and I could see accountability groups, small groups, and Sunday classes using it for a study."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I appreciated the fact that Mahaney started the book by acknowledging that it is almost an oxymoron to say that you are writing a book on Humilty. People immediately think you obviously have no humility if you think you can tell the rest of us what it is :)But this little booklet is definitely a necessary book for those of us who need to defeat the sin of pride and develop the Biblical trait of humility.His working definition for humility in this book is; \\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" That is a wonderful definition. We all acknowledge that God is holy and we should all acknowledge that we are sinful. So, if we stop to acknowledge these facts and that they apply to our private lives then we will be on the road to humility.Chapter three of the book looks at Jesus and how He re-defines greatness! As you read you will be reminded that Jesus reminded even his disciples that if you wished to be the greates in the kingdom of God you needed to become the least, the servant of all. You need to humble yourself taking on the form of a bondservant.Then Chapter 4 deals with the content that is essential to grasp the truth of what it means to be humble. This is probably the most pivital chapter in the text. Mahaney gives us many scriptural references to help us put the meat on the bones of humility. When you finish chapter four you know what is needed to become humble, you probably just don't know how to go about it.So, starting in Chapter 5 Mahaney gives us his list of practical ways to weaken pride and cultivate humility. He does state, \\"For your own purposes, think of the items on my list simply as recommendations, not requirements--as suggestions for your consideration.\\" He is acknowledging that you don't want to become legalistic in your trying to develop Humility. It is a gift that God gives to you as you strive to develop your walk with Christ.So, the recommendations flow through the rest of the book and are excellent. When you finish I'm sure you will have a full list of things that you should be striving for in your battle to defeat sin, especially the sin of Pride and to put on the Christ-like character trait of humility.To give just one example of the recommendations Mahaney starts with the recommendation to, \\"Reflect on the Wonder of the Cross.\\" As you reflect on the cross you will not be able to look at it without seeing how sinful you are that it required Christ going to the cross to reconcile you with the Father. Your pride will be put away as you realize the work of the cross and that it was done for you. This will certainly drive you to your knees in humbleness as you declare to the Lord your thankfulness for what He has done.Well, there are many other things in the book that will help you develop humility, but you won't know what they are until you purchase and read this masterpiece on the Character Trait of Humility.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Most books I will only read once, but there are a few books that are worth reading once every year or every couple of years - Humility: True Greatness is one of those books that I need to reread often.- It focuses on one of the key character traits of a Christ follower- It is biblical- It focuses on the cross- It is practical- It is an easy read, even though some of what is written is hard to hear- It is a quick readEven if you have read Andrew Murray's Humility, this book is still worth purchasing. It is easier to read and more practical than Murray's book. The Prideful Soul's Guide to Humility is also a great book on humility and that book and Humility: True Greatness are both different enough that I would recommend owning both."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This is not only a biblically centered and focused book, but the writer has also given the reader some immediate practices to put into place to begin their journey towards a deeper humility.

CJ Mahaney is a tremdous author and dynamic speaker.

I pray that this book is the latter in my own life."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Humility is indeed a much neglected, yet essential facet of the Christian life. If we would be like Jesus, we must cultivate humility.The first part of this book postulates this very premise. This first part is an excellent read.The rest of the book provides basic counsel on how to cultivate humility. Some may be disappointed with this section because the counsel contained therein is nothing new. But what makes us think that there must be something new--as if we in the 21st Century must discover new ways to do everything? The basic \\"old-ways\\" of declaring war on pride are likely to be the best ways. We don't need new ways, we need merely to make use of the old ways.This little volume is a notably good read (though not necessarily great), and if acted upon will no doubt lead many to harvest much fruit of humility. Thank you C.J."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"If you are like me, humility is not something that comes naturally. Reading this book will not make you humble. Reading this book will help you understand what humility is, why it is important, and how it manifests itself in your life. I'd recommend it to any and every Christian."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This is a thin book but don't let it's length deceive you. This is one of the most challenging books I have ever read in my life! From the beginning C.J. Mahaney makes it clear that he is aware that nobody on this earth, short of Jesus, should be righting a book about humility. Each chapter offers challenges to the reader and will cause any reader to re-evaluate his/her life and thought process. If you believe yourself to be humble, give the book a read and you will realize that you are far from humble. This book is not one that encourages self-deprecation. It allows the reader to take an honest evaluation of his/her life and find ways to make the necessary changes to become a man/woman after God's own heart.I would recommend this book to everyone I know! I have personally read it twice and am about to start a small group based on this book."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"In a light and easy-to-read fashion, Mahaney presents a biblical account of humility. His whimsical and comedic style may keep you from realizing the depth of his message at first glance. But it is deep--bringing to the front of your mind tangible examples of pride and of humility. It is convicting to the core and draws you to prayer and confession for the idolatrous living which has gone almost unnoticed in your life. Mahaney is transparent revealing areas of his life that show he has no place for pride or arrogance and yet divulges in it nonetheless; I found myself laughing aloud on more than one occasion as he relates the absurdity of finding pride in himself... only moments before reflecting on comparable absurdities in mine own life.The book is divided into three sections, 12 chapters detailing the reason for the study of humility (1), what humility is (2), and ways to cultivate humility (3). It is grounded both theologically and practically so that the mind is never divorced from the actions. He keeps the whole hope of humility in proper perspective seeing Christ as the only perfect example of humility, and even more than that the only enabler of humility--for if Christ had not been who he was and done what he has done, then we would have been imprisoned in the chains of pride for eternity. But Christ's sacrifice frees us from the bonds of sin (and pride) and enables us to live in humility.It's a short read which yields much fruit, and I recommend it to all persons.Take offense against pride.Enjoy the pleasure of humility.After reading the book, I do suggest reading the following article:[...]And then:[...]"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I am normally not a fan of what I call, \\"Christian, self-help books,\\" but this was an exception.

It's helped me learn a lot about pride and humility and one of the best things about it is all the practical application. I recommend it for anyone."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This is great book that reminded me and taught me how to preach the gospel to myself daily and glorify God by encouraging others."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"A friend shared a quote that I think is the central issue with humility. \\"Every problem in the world is a relationship problem. The problem with relationships is pride. The solution to that problem is humility.\\"The older I get, the more I want to say that real and deep wisdom comes with age. Not that with age comes wisdom, because I know many older people that have never acquired wisdom. But that in order to really develop wisdom, you need some years. C.J. Mahaney is a good example of someone that has put in the time and effort into developing wisdom. Humility is a great example of a good book that if we put it into practice will help us move in the direction of spiritual growth, wisdom, and of course, humility.The first section of Humility is devoted to a description of what is and is not humility, and why pride, the opposite of humility, is the root of all other sin. Mahaney uses a simple way to help describe pride. Pride is when \\"we contend with God for supremacy\\". He says that years before contemplating this book he started making confession to God, and occasionally to others, around pride. He stopped saying, \\"Please forgive me for my pride\\" and started saying \\"Please forgive me for contending with God for supremacy.\\" This focuses him more on what pride, and humility, are really about.The remainder of the book (about the last 75 percent) is devoted to practical ways to encourage humility. Some of them are practices of spiritual devotion, along the lines of Spiritual Devotions for the Christian Life (my review) which is specifically mentioned. But there are many others, like re-claiming our commute. There is also an extended section on sleep, why it is important, why God created it and what we should do for spiritual benefit as we get ready for it. This is probably the closest that anyone I am aware of has come to a theology of sleep.There is also an extended discussion on Habakkuk about the relationship of suffering and humility. There is good quote from DA Carson, \\"The truth of the matter is that all we have to do is live long enough and we will suffer.\\" Mahaney then suggests that we need to prepare to respond humbly to trials. He does not really deal with the problem of evil (why is there suffering) but instead focuses on how suffering can allow us to better focus on humility before God.The final section is on parenting. I am not a parent, but I am a full time nanny for my two nieces (2 1/2 and 1). I think the 15 minutes (on audiobook) or so of why we should focus on developing humility in our children and some practical steps on how to do it are worth the price of the book. Like the rest of the book, the parenting section isn't revolutionary, but it is clear, succinct and convicting. Overall this is a great book.(I was provided a free audio copy of this book for review.)"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Jesus modeled it. God graces it. Scripture commands it. People desire it. And yet the attribute of humility goes against every fiber of our humanity. C. J. Mahaney has not simply written a book with an attractive title. He has provided Godly counsel on steps we can take to insure humility is a way of life not simply a character quality we are chasing.Written in three sections, Humility begins with an excellent description of the battles we face against our pride and then outlining with Scriptural support God's definition of greatness. Without this foundation, the third section of the book is simply an empty set of disciplines. It is in the third section that Mahaney outlines several daily practices he has discovered throughout His faith journey that encourage him to move closer to humility rather than farther from it.This is a must read for anyone desiring to decrease in their lives so that God might increase in it. I give Humility: True Greatness five stars. This will be one of several books I re-read consistently!"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Why I recommend it - I gave the book 5 stars because it is really well written, biblical, and application oriented. CJ's style of writing is well illustrated, but not over illustrated. The books starts good and surprisingly gets better and better. The emphasis is not philosophy of humility, the book is focused on helping the reader cultivate humility in his or her life. I wish I could buy copies for all my good friends.Specifics:Well written: I really appreciate writers who illustrate their points well, but do not over illustrate their points. This makes for shorter better books. Each major point is supported by Scripture and genuine in that he shares about his life and experiences. I was surprised that the book got better and better. The last chapter on parenting or legacy was powerful - really struck me as a Dad of two little ones.Biblical: I bought the book hoping that he would give some detail to the spiritual warfare involved in pride versus humility. Satan and his forces of darkness love to encourage pride in us and we see this in Scripture. CJ barely mentions Satan or forces of darkness - disappointing. However, the book is biblically solid and even though he didn't develop the theme I was looking for, I was encouraged and challenged by his emphasis on application or cultivating humility in the Christian life.Application oriented: about 7 years ago I read Humilty by Andrew Murray with a group of guys, I remember loving Murray, but struggling to get through it. Murray's classic is quite \\"heady.\\" Mahaney's book is quite different. Mahaney sets the stage in the first couple chapters and then he takes you on a practical - daily approach to cultivating humility in your life. Really good applications.Memorable nuggets:Isaiah 66:2 - \\"...this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.\\"James 4:6 - \\"God... gives grace to the humble\\"\\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\"John Stott \\"At every stage of our Christian development and in every sphere of our Christian discipleship, pride is the greatest enemy and humility our greatest friend.\\"\\"Pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of God and refuse to acknowledge their dependence upon Him\\"1 Peter 5:5 - \\"God opposes the proud\\"Jonathan Edwards, Pride is, \\"the worst viper that is in the heart... the greatest disturber of the soul's peace and sweet communion with Christ... the most hidden, secret, and deceitful of all lusts.\\"\\"...true greatness as biblically defined: serving others for the glory of God. This is the genuine expression of humility; this is true greatness as the Savior defined it\\"\\"To learn true humility, we need more than a redefinition of greatness; we need even more than Jesus' example... Mark 10:45... true greatness is not even possible for us apart from the Savior's unique sacrifice.\\" What we need is His death.\\"Begin your day by acknowledging your dependence upon god and your need for God\\"Gratefulness is an evidence of humility.\\"The humble are genuinely care free\\" 1 Peter 5 - God cares for you and He will lift you upHumble yourself, \\"receive the gift of sleep from God and acknowledge His purpose for sleep\\"The Apostle Paul and his grace to the church at Corinth - great example/illustrationHumble people speak word of encouragement to those around themInvite and pursue correction from other people in your life.Great chapter of trials and humility.Chapter 12 - A Legacy of Greatness - this chapter alone is worth the price of the book - fantastic!\\"Ultimately, there can be no effective expansion of your life's mission and ministry, no fulfillment of the specific purpose He's called you to, apart from the cultivation of humility in your heart and the weakening of pride in your life\\"END"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"God has done an amazing work in the life of C.J. Mahaney. Mahaney is a man who understands humility, and a man who has taught me much about the cross of Christ. I highly, highly recommend watching his testimony on YouTube. Humility is the third Mahaney book I have read, and one that I just received last month. I have had serious problems in the area of humility so I thought this fast read (a small book with less than 180 pages) could help me in the battle with my old nature. I found the last chapter, A Legacy of Greatness, to be particularly meaningful. Humility is a book that is easy to understand and contains a God-glorifying message.\\"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.\\" James 4:10"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Humility is topic of great importance and the reward of such a characteristic is beyond monetary value. C.J. Mahaney uses Isaiah 66:2 as his topic verse for his book, \\"Humility: True Greatness\\". That verse states, \\"This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.\\"In \\"Humility: True Greatness\\", Mahaney divides the book into three sections: 1.) Our Greatest Friend, Our Greatest Enemy, 2.) The Great Reversal and 3.) Our Great Pursuit. In Section one, he talks about humility being the Christian's friend while pride is our greatest enemy. Section two is all about Jesus and how He dealt with humility personally and with His disciples. And in section three, C.J. gives a daily checklist, if you will, on how one can develop humility in their life.I really enjoyed this little book for several reason. The first is he talks about James and John coming to Jesus with their prideful request, but when you look at the end of their lives the same men that made that request would die humbly before and for their Savior. The difference was that the sacrifice and example of Jesus gripped these men and forever changed them. The second is that when you go to correct someone, that this time to present the gospel. Never give up the opportunity when you are correcting someone to present to them the Savior and His gospel. Thirdly, his checklist is great - its full of wonderful spiritual instruction, but also fun non spiritual activity. I am confident that when done, humility will follow."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"This book is very up lifting and reminds us that it is not all about us in this world.

First I wonder if you are familiar with the comment of Adam Clarke on the humility of Moses? He says the Hebrew word for humility, anavah - &ograve;&auml;, is related to the word for suffering, Inui - &ograve;&eacute;&eacute;, and thus Moses' humility is related to the suffering he endured over his lifetime and especially during the 40 years in the wilderness with complaining and rebellious Israel.[...]Verse 3. Now the man Moses was very meekHow could Moses, who certainly was as humble and modest as he was meek, write this encomium upon himself? I think the word is not rightly understood; anav, which we translate meek, comes from anah, to act upon, to humble, depress, afflict, and is translated so in many places in the Old Testament; and in this sense it should be understood here: \\"Now this man Moses was depressed or afflicted more than any man haadamah, of that land.\\" And why was he so? Because of the great burden he had to bear in the care and government of this people, and because of their ingratitude and rebellion both against God and himself: of this depression and affliction, see the fullest proof in the preceding chapter. The very power they envied was oppressive to its possessor, and was more than either of their shoulders could sustain.2. On page 101 you omit \\"love\\" from the list of fruit of the Spirit from Galatians 5!3. On page 51 you write that God \\"executed\\" His Son. I find this concept objectionable for the following reasons. I prefer to view Jesus' death as His willingly laying down His life in a ransom that God accepted on behalf of us sinners. To say that God executed Jesus would imply that the Sanhedrin righteously condemned Him to death, which the Gospels clearly refute. Also it is very offensive to unbelievers to think that God \\"executed\\" His perfect Son. I think it is both Scripturally correct and also more evangelistically tactful to portray Jesus' death as His own free-will decision to sacrifice Himself. Ultimately it is an immense mystery.4. The only part of your book that disappointed me was on page 162 where you discuss how you encourage your son to watch professional sports with discernment. I think this is a terrible mistake. You rightly note that the \\"greatness\\" of professional athletes is not Biblical. Indeed, there are many things about professional sports that hardly could be called Biblical. Consider the obscene salaries, while school teachers have minimal wages. Consider the violence. Consider that most spectators themselves are woefully out of shape, beer guzzling, hot dog scarfing lazy swine! Professional sports is a form of gross and lurid entertainment that does nothing to improve the physical health of most Americans and indeed caters to their worst instincts. It is not much different, to my mind, than pornography. Therefore, I cannot understand why you encourage your son to watch it with \\"discernment\\". Would you encourage him to watch a strip-show with \\"discernment\\" to filter out the lust? This is a good example of how Americans seem unable to take a categorical stand against evil and instead seek ways to compromise and play with it. It is clear that professional sports is a seriously dangerous form of modern idolatry, and the Christian response to idolatry should be not to \\"sanitize\\" it but to flee from it!Again thanks for doing the humble thing in writing this book, and thanks for pondering my comments."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Humility: True Greatness by C.J. Mahaney is a book about humility from a man who claims to be anything but. He expounds not his own wisdom, but wisdom firmly founded in the Word of God.Mahaney writes to fellow Christians and exhorts us to redefine true greatness from a biblical perspective and to pursue it by the means laid out in the Bible and the practical implications of those means.The book is organized into three parts, containing twelve chapters in all along with a brief introduction and closing comments.Part 1, \\"Our Greatest Friend, Our Greatest Enemy\\", lays the purpose of the book bare and contrasts pride with humility. Mahaney's definition of humility was particularly helpful: \\"Humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness.\\" (Mahaney 22)Part 2, \\"The Great Reversal\\", lays the theological foundations for the remainder of the book. Here, Mahaney works to redefine greatness and argues that the ultimate example of greatness was in the humble submission of Christ to the will of the Father on the cross.Part 3, \\"Our Great Pursuit\\", comprises eight chapters and contains the bulk of the practical implications of the groundwork Mahaney has laid.Chapters five and six focus on day-to-day practices to cultivate humility. Mahaney exhorts us to begin each day acknowledging our complete reliance upon God working in us and to end each day acknowledging any good we have accomplished is due to God's grace at work in our hearts.Chapter seven provides suggestions for extended study including God's incommunicable attributes and the doctrines of grace. Mahaney believes studying these grand theological concepts will lead us into an ever deeper understanding of our utter dependence upon God.Chapters eight, nine, and ten place emphasis on interaction with others. Mahaney advocates for the importance of identifying evidences of grace in one another by observing manifestations of the fruits of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit in the lives of others. We must think, \\"This individual has been previously acted upon by God. That's the divine perspective we must begin with, or else we will be tempted to look for others' deficiencies rather than for the evidences of grace in their lives.\\" (103) We are also exhorted to encourage others by listening actively with the intent of speaking Gospel saturated words appropriate to each individuals' current needs. Finally, Mahaney instructs us on pursuing correction from others as they hold up the mirror of the Word of God to our lives and ensure we apply the truth we know.Chapter eleven uses the book of Habakkuk to demonstrate the biblical framework for responding humbly to suffering and trials. Mahaney cites Habakkuk as exemplifying being prayerful before God, patiently waiting on God, and rejoicing in God. Mahaney also describes the change in which results from responding in this manner.Mahaney closes the book in chapter twelve with an emphasis on leaving a legacy of true greatness among our children. We build a legacy of humility in future generations by being an example for our children, teaching them to define and discern true greatness, to celebrate evidence of humility in their own lives, and to see it in us and in people in the church who serve with humility.This small volume contained many profound challenges. I found the chapter on identifying evidences of grace in others particularly challenging. I am plagued by pride and cynicism; I believe looking for evidence of the grace of God in others' lives will let me see them in a divine perspective, prohibiting looking down on them. Furthermore, any boast I would make is dissuaded by seeing myself next to the cross. As Mahaney (quoting John Stott) puts it \\"\`All of us have inflated views of ourselves, especially in self-righteousness, until we have visited a place called Calvary. It is there, at the foot of the cross, that we shrink to our true size.'\\" (67)I should also note, pride manifests different ways for different people. Some may be overconfident and boastful, possibly even egotistical. This book is for them. Others may lack confidence and be self-effacing, always deferring to others. This book is also for them. Pride is at the root of both types of people. \\"Pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of God and refuse to acknowledge their dependence upon Him.\\" (31) Both types of people are ignoring the truth of the cross and our dependence upon Christ. We are all guilty of one or the other or both.Therefore, I heartily recommend you read this book. Buy it, underline in it, write in it, meditate on it, read it several times, and be challenged."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Far too many of us think more highly of ourselves than we should, especially those of us in leadership. This book helps us realize that the path to greatness lies in humility not arrogance. People who liked this book will also enjoyBe Last: Descending to Greatness"},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Many Christian books are nice little treatises on things you already know, already agree with, and happily nod about without much life change. Some are educational, but not necessarily transformative. C.J. Mahaney's Humility, thankfully, does not fall into either negative category. In this brief work from one of the T4G guys, readers gain knowledge, receive practical advice, and feel powerful conviction.Normally I'd be breaking this down into what I liked, what I disliked, and a set of recommendations. I don't, however, have any real complaints, so I'm just going to share with you the three main points I love about this book.Mahaney is wonderfully gospel-centered. C.J. recognizes that the most important aid in our humility is not a set of prescribed exercises. No, the cross is the most important way for us to become more humble. As we allow our minds to again ponder the fact that our sin is so vile, so ugly, so evil, and so costly that it could only be paid for by the brutal death of the Son of god in concert with the Father's outpouring of his wrath, we are humbled, wonderfully humbled.Mahaney also teaches well that humility is not merely a virtue that we might want to cultivate among many others. Instead, he argues well that pride is our greatest enemy and that humility, therefore, must be our best friend. If we want joy in our Christian lives, we must cultivate humility.This work also contains many very helpful tips. Mahaney offers practical advice in a winsome way to point Christians toward developing godly humility. The advice is the kind of stuff that average folks can really do, but not so simplistic that fairly mature believers can't learn a thing or two.The bottom line here is that I am very fond of Humility. Mahaney did a good job. He's fun, funny, helpful, humble, and piercing. If you are a believer in Christ, you can definitely benefit from spending some time with C.J. and working to rid yourself of pride and cultivate humility."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"\\"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble\\" (1 Pet. 5:5b)We live in a culture that is built on pride. Facebook, blogs, podcasts, vodcasts, our self-esteem centered education system (our city has a no-fail policy), marketing... Everything about our culture is centered around \\"me.\\"The message we constantly receive is, \\"You're special. You're worth it. You're a winner. You're unique. Be the best you that you can be.\\"It is a message designed to bolster our pride. Without question, pride is considered a (if not the) primary virtue in our society. And, most troublesomely, it's an attitude that's crept into the church. It affects how we serve, how we give, how we participate in corporate worship, how we interact with non-believers.But, God opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble, doesn't He?In Humility: True Greatness, C.J. Mahaney reminds us of the spiritually-critical need for every Christian to pursue humility by the grace of God, and provides readers with some helpful tools to aid us in our pursuit.Humility is, without hyperbole, is the most needed character trait for all Christians. It's also the most elusive, because as soon as we profess to be humble, we reveal ourselves to be proud. But what is biblical humility? Mahaney defines is as, \\"honestly assessing ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness\\" (p. 22). It is an honest assessment that affirms the need of the Savior. We cannot possibly hope to be holy as God is holy without grace. And grace requires humility.As Mahaney methodically moves through both his arguments about the perils of pride and how we can cultivate humility in our own lives, he reminds us that pride is not simply a sin, but it is one hated by God with a particular passion--indeed, John Stott calls it \\"the root of all sin.\\"Because of pride, we make idols for ourselves (or of ourselves). Because of pride, our first parents rebelled. Because of pride, Satan fell. Because of pride, Jesus was beaten and crucified.This book is particularly helpful to me because I struggle with pride to a frightening degree. As those who know me can attest, I can be extremely prideful about everything. It tempts me to rebel against the authorities over me. It tempts me to indulge my selfish desires over the desires of my wife and friends.I've read this book several times, and every time I've found something that I didn't notice or appreciate in the previous reading. But every time, I'm struck by the profundity of what I believe to be the heart of the book:\\"Reflect on the wonder of the cross of Christ... To truly be serious and deliberate in mortifying pride and cultivating greatness, you must each day survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died.\\"And (quoting D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones):\\"Nothing else can do it. When I see that I am a sinner...that nothing but the Son of God on the cross can save me, I'm humbled to the dust...Nothing but the cross can give us the spirit of humility\\" (p. 66).The cross destroys our pride as we see our true selves when we gaze upon it. May we gaze upon it all the more as we appreciate the important reminder from a \\"proud man pursuing humility by the grace of God\\" (p. 13)This book has become essential reading for me, one I turn to again and again. I hope it will be the same for you."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"When I paged through this little book at the bookshop, I kept finding pages that spoke directly to issues I was facing with fear, anxiety, pride, etc., so I knew I had to have it and read from cover to cover. It is a very quick read and has been quite helpful to me. I ended up giving away my copy, and missed it so I bought another. I keep it by my bed, almost as a devotional, with reminders of how to deal with adversity, anxiety, or just ongoing cultivation of spiritual maturity.I particularly found valuable an insight that anxiety is rooted in pride, in a need to be self-sufficient.I highly recommend, and plan to seek this author's other books."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"C. J. Mahaney defines humility as a realistic evaluation of ourselves in light of God's holiness and our sinfulness. Humility is seeing the truth about ourselves. I think I can say with confidence that there's not one Christian who oughtn't be more humble. When we assess ourselves, we are much more likely to evaluate ourselves as better than we really are, than we are to see ourselves accurately. Our problem is not lack of self-esteem, but too much self-esteem. So this is a book we all ought to be interested in, even though we might find the subject...well...humbling.This is a short book and a quick read. The first two sections deal with the biblical reasons we ought to be humble and the biblical example of humility that we find in Christ himself. The last section is the largest section of the book, and it's the \\"how-to\\" of humility: What can we do to grow some in ourselves and in those we are responsible for.This last section is where the strength of the book is. I'm not a big reader of \\"how-to\\" books, but this is not pop-psychology, but practical biblical advice. For instance, this section examines things like what we can do first thing in the morning to give us a humble outlook, what we can do at the close of the day to remind us of our dependence on God and his grace, and how we can encourage others.I wish there had been more exegetical examination of the various scriptural texts that deal with humility--like my personal favorite: Philippians 2: 1-11--but that's probably just me wanting a book that's more the sort of thing that I really, really like to read. Practical is good, and Humility: True Greatness is nothing if not practical. It gives us the down-to-earth, bottom-line, nitty-gritty on a quality I need more of, and I bet you do, too."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"I've always known that pride had a habit of sneaking up on me.

It is a good book for anyone interested in becoming more like Christ."},{"Title":"Humility: True Greatness","review":"Arrogance is something with which all Christians struggle, especially leaders.

I recommend this title highly to all Christian leaders to help keep their God and their own egos in the proper perspectives."},{"Title":"Spencer's Mountain","review":"I bought this book to read to my children ages 11 & 12. We have been watching the first season of the Walton's on DVD. I stopped after a few paragraphs, because it seemed a little too \\"adult content\\" for them as he was talking about drinking and smoking as being OK. Doesn't seem to have the same \\"family\\" feeling as the show. For adult readers it is a good book, but one should not assume that even though it is the basis for the Walton's that it has the same message."},{"Title":"Spencer's Mountain","review":"Spencer's Mountain has been a favorite of mine since I was a very young boy. I first came across it in a Reader's Digest collection. Having been raised in a rural setting myself, there was much about Spencer's Mountain that I identified with and I certainly felt a kinship with Clay-Boy. Later when The Waltons came along (after the book had been made into a movie starring Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara among others) I found the adjustments to the story line a little disappointing, but not so much that I did not come to enjoy The Waltons.The allure of Spencer's Mountain for me is the strong commitment to family. This is a typical family of the time that did not have an abundance of material possessions, but they had in abundance the things that make a family a family. This family had a commitment to security for its own, but it also had the seed of transformation for those in their rural community. I think Hamner captures the values of the people who lived during the time this family was set. For someone raised in an urban setting the circumstances, environment and diversity of people may be different but the themes are as true in the urban setting as they are in the rural setting.If you want to be transported back to a time that appears to be simpler, but was really complicated by the absence of margin, financially speaking, read this book over a weekend. Spencer's Mountain strips away all of the modern day props to reveal the value and importance of family, a father and mother who desire great things for their children and children who know that they are loved and great sacrifice has been expended on their behalf creating in them a desire to do the same for others. It is a pay it forward sort of story starting with a father and mother."},{"Title":"Spencer's Mountain","review":"Recently having discovered \\"The Waltons\\" via DVD box sets, I was thrilled to find out the series was actually based upon a book.However, that's where my joy ended. While Hamner may indeed have based the television show upon his book, it's incredibly hard to see. Very few things remain consistent between the two. All the names, save Grandpa Zeb and mother Olivia, are different. There's even a discrepancy between the number of children in the Spencer/Walton family! The Waltons have 7, while the Spencers have 11.Reading the Spencers' story, which takes place entirely over the course of one summer, I did recognize a few elements. On Spencer's Mountain, there are two spinster sisters who make their papa's recipe. Eldest son Clay-Boy is a voracious reader who is determined to fight all obstacles in order to go to college. The mountain's minister -- like John Ritter on the show -- initially makes a bad impression upon the community because of accidental inebriation.However, too many things are missing or just plain \\"off.\\" While Clay-Boy is indeed smart and college-bound, there is no mention of his being an aspiring writer...one of the main characteristics of John-Boy in the screen version. It's disconcerting, really.As a stand-alone book, \\"Spencer's Mountain\\" is a decent work. However, if you're like me, a fan of \\"The Waltons,\\" you're better off sticking to the television version, as you won't get much satisfaction here."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin Vs. Herlock Sholmes: A Classic Tale of the World's Greatest Thief and the World's Greatest Detective!","review":"Most English speakers are unfamiliar with Arsene Lupin. He is one of France's most famous fictional characters--a gentleman master thief. He's the sort of anti-hero who uses his brains and his carm to escape from any situation the police may put him in. In this novel, the police have failed to capture Lupin again, so one of the victims calls on the famous English detective Herlock Sholmes (obviously Sherlock Holmes). The Holmes of this novel is a little different than the Holmes of Conan Doyle. This Holmes is a little more rigid and cold-hearted than Doyle's Holmes. He works like a machine and is always hot on Lupin's tracks. The world's greatest detective verses the world's greatest thief--who will win?This novel seems to use an old translation. Some of the phrases are a little old-fashioned, and it seems that the translation was perhaps a bit too tight. If they retranslated this and used a more modern writing style, it would really improve this book. However, this is the only translation available that I know of. Despite this, I still give this book five stars because once you start reading this book, you forget about the structural problems. You just want to find out who will win."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin Vs.

Arsene Lupin vs. Herlock Sholmes would have been better off however, had LeBlanc not written out the parts of Holmes and Watson or as they are called here Herlock and Wilson so poorly.For fans of the Lupin series but not many Conan Doyle fans will appreciate this detective.Unlike the Holmes and Watson that Conan Doyle fans have come to love, Herlock and Wilson are NOT what any C.D. fan would expect. Herlock is crude, cold-hearted, and has quite a temper. Meanwhile, Wilson is very stupid and makes a hobby of stating the obvious (literally). There is good reason why LeBlact couldn't use the names of Sherlock and Watson, he didn't deserve to (that and I'm sure some nice lawyers would sue him relentlessly for copyright infringement).I you are a fan of the Lupin series then you'll most likely love this as well, for fans of the REAL Sherlock Holmes......probably not, for those who have not read the original S.H. I recomend reading the original before this. But the one thing that I did take away from this book is a new-found appreciation for my new favorite thief, Arsene Lupin, as a stand-alone series it IS great, but mixing it with the S.H. franchise.....not the best idea in the world...well maybe if it was more true to the original character."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin Vs.

Williams points out that people spend 78% of their lives within organizations and this reality makes clear the need for a sound conceptual base for the integration of people and systems.This book focuses on a body of knowledge that balances and requires the bringing together of many disciplines to create a theory of congruence and transformation (of both organization and the individual).It is a treasure trove of knowledge and insights, bound to inform, stimulate, and delight anyone who seeks a multidimensional understanding of human organization. Open to any page and you are likely to become absorbed in the rich content that Williams presents.The book is deep and rich with substance. It is sure to appeal to those of who are always hunting for those hard-to-find books that go below the surface of facile bullet-points or 'how-to' steps, with little or no mention or concern for the 'why's' or context. As a organization consultant (FutureOrganization.com) I was quickly drawn into this book. I found this book packed with first-rate thinking, cover-to-cover. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Pushkin Handbook (Wisconsin Center for Pushkin Studies)","review":"As an aspiring Pushkinist I was very interested in this book which identifies itself as a collection of critical essays related to Pushkin's works. What they don't bother to tell you is that 13 of the 28 essays are completely in Russian and no translation is provided. All they give you is a pathetic one to two paragraph summary at the beginning of each of the Russian essays to \\"summarize\\" what it's about. So essentially if you aren't really advanced in Russian to the point of being able to read academic essays 1/2 of this book will be completely worthless to you. Honestly if you were that fluent in Russian to begin with you wouldn't be looking for a book in English to begin with about the subject!

I have been looking for ways to increase the thinking skills of my students. This books incorporates beautifully Bloom's hiearchy of skills. Vocabulary, creating ideas and good writing all increase but in a very exciting and challenging way. The lessons really encourage the students to think. So many times we stop at the knowledge level of Bloom's Taxonomy, we stunt the creative writing and thinking process. Suppose the Wolf Were an Octopus can help to correct that problem.

He covers a broad spectrum of Biblical subjects, and treats them in a relatively thorough, albeit limited manner. Because he has produced a single volume theology, Berkhof must express himself in a succinct manner. He succeeds at this without compromising the clarity or quality of his thoughts. For a single volume theology, Berkhof's is hard to beat.

He covers well much of Reformed theology in it. My only caveat is that it is now nearly 80 years old, and thus cannot interact with falsehood that has come up since. However, it covers the truth of the Scripture well. Bank tellers can tell bogus/counterfeit money because it's \\"different\\" from real money that they handle all the time. Master this volume and you'll know if something's \\"different\\" theologically.Prof. Berkhof uses many, many references to demonstrate that all the teaching is from the Bible itself. There are useful study questions and suggestions for further thought at the end of each chapter, as well as suggestions for further reading.

As a pastor, I consult this book regularly for doctrinal preaching and recently acquired a copy for our church's library. Readers both new and well-versed in Reformed dogmatics will find this text unsurpassed as a survey of theology proper, ecclesiology, christology, eschatology and other primary foci of biblical doctrine."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Solid, methodical, broad in reach, and always faithfully Reformed, Berkhof provides a much-needed compendium on Systematic Theology. This work is still used in numerous Seminaries and Bible colleges. In his magnum opus Berkhof stipulates theological truth as he explains all the essential doctrines of the Christian faith. The author confutes the myth that systematic theology is boring and reveals that when it comes to concise organized theological truth, no one outdoes his effort.Great for personal or family devotions! Perfect for Sunday school classes.World named it: \\"One of the top 100 books of the millennium.\\"With this book-Berkhof presents a readable and precise catalogue of theology that no one should ignore. Almost a 1000 pages and now it comes with a fine introduction.

Anyone Reformed and doing studies in systematic theology should read this text. The strengths of this work, IMO, are its organization and breadth/thoroughness. It's also fairly well balanced in that each subject is given a brief historical treatment, a polemic, and a positive presentation of the author's position (except where the author takes no position, like in the case of Supra- vs. Infralapsarianism).The weaknesses of this work are (1) it's lack of documentation, (2) its dated discussions, and (3) its lack of exegesis.Concerning (1), I'm skeptical of historical analysis and sketches of opposing systems that don't quote directly and document the sources. Berkhof does a few times in a few places, but it should be much more prevalent. But as far as I can tell, this isn't unique to Berkhof. It seems to be a common problem in older works (e.g. Cornelius Van Til), owing to different standards in scholarship I guess.Concerning (2), Berkhof's interaction with opposing ideas is pretty dated. For instance, he interacts with \\"Millenial Dawnism\\" on several occasions and has no interaction with current issues like Open Theism. This isn't too big a problem though since I would say the majority of his discussion is still relevant in principle and he covers such a wide range of issues (e.g. he has some things to say on Molinism).Concerning (3), Berkhof proof-texts the issues 85% of the time. Sometimes I don't think his proof-texts are very good. Granted, Systematic Theologies generally don't do a lot of exegesis. However, I read Robert Reymond's New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith last year and I think his work is stronger exegetically than Berkhof's.(A more minor complaint is that sometimes Berkhof will quote some Dutch or Latin and not bother to translate it, some of it is translated in the footnotes, but not all of it.)Nevertheless, even though I've spent a bit more time on the negative qualities of the work, the positive qualities outweigh the former."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"I bought my first time systematic theology book in my life.Though it is a used one I am satisfied.God bless you.I recommend another good book to readfor \\"knowing\\" God more.The Mosaic of Christian BeliefThanks."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"I have been reading many systematic theology books and other resources to keep my understanding straight regarding the sound doctrine.

(I would say \\"THE best\\", but that would be presumptuous.)Berkhof's Theology has everything one could desire in a one volume reference; all the subjects are broken down and covered in their various smaller parts, with footnotes, bibliographies, author and subject indices. What I find very helpful is how he puts forth the various theological schools and briefly compares them so that the reader can get a better understanding of the breadth of denominational nuances. The \\"Questions for further Study\\" section at the end of each chapter is a great help in understanding how much more there is to comprehend and learn. This book is from a Reformed perspective.

This skill may go under rated - but in a work such as a systematic theology it is critical.He stands in the tradition of orthodox Christianity & presents very weighty topics in an understandable way."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"'The greater number of conservative scholars, however, continued to conceive of theology as the science of God, though frequently with the distinct understanding that they did not regard God apart from His creation as the object of theology, but God as related to His creatures.' p 41'Christian theism is opposed to both a deistic separation of God from the world and a pantheistic confusion of God with the world. Hence the doctrine of creation is immediately followed by that of providence, in which the scriptural view of God's relation to the world is clearly defined. Thus the word 'providence' has come to signify the provision which God makes for the ends of His government, and the preservation and government of all His creatures. With its doctrine of providence the church took position against both the Epicurean notion that the world is governed by chance, and the Stoic view that it is ruled by fate. From the very start theologians took the position that God preserves and governs the world.' p 165'When the Lord delivers the righteous, the fruit which results from it is that they themselves, and all the rest of the righteous acquire increasing confidence in His grace; for unless we are fully persuaded that God exercises a care about men and human affairs, we must necessarily be troubled with constant anxiety.' John Calvin,Commentary on Psalms 9:9p 119'Theologians generally distinguish between general and special providence, the former denoting God's control of the universe as a whole, and the latter, His care for each part of it in relation to the whole. There are those who are willing to admit a general providence, an administration of the world under a fixed system of general laws, but deny that there is also a special providence in which God concerns Himself with the details of history, the affairs of human life, and particularly the experiences of the righteous. At the same time it must be said that it involves a very poor, superficial, and un-Biblical view of God to say that He does not and cannot concern Himself with the details of life, cannot answer prayer, give relief in emergencies, or intervene miraculously in behalf of man. The Bible teaches that even the minutest details of life are of divine ordering.' pp. 168 -169'The epochs of the history of redemption are marked by God's watching over His word (Jer 1:11-12).'Edmund P Clowney,Still Sovereignp 328THE CHARACTER THIS COVENANT ASSUMED FOR CHRIST'Though the covenant of redemption is the eternal basis of the covenant of grace, and, as far as sinners are concerned, also its eternal prototype, it was for Christ a covenant of works rather than a covenant of grace. For Him the law of the original covenant applied, namely, that eternal life could only be obtained by meeting the demands of the law. As the last Adam, Christ obtains eternal life for sinners in reward for faithful obedience, and not at all as an unmerited gift of grace. And what He has done as the Representative and Surety of all His people, they are no more in duty bound to do.' p 268CHRIST'S WORK IN THE COVENANT LIMITED BY THE DECREE OF ELECTION'Some have identified the covenant of redemption with election; but this is clearly a mistake. Election has reference to the selection of persons destined to be the heirs of everlasting glory in Christ. The counsel of redemption, on the other hand, refers to the way in which, and, the means by which grace and glory are prepared for sinners. Election, indeed, also has reference to Christ and reckons with Christ, for believers are said to be elected in Him. Logically, election precedes the counsel of redemption, because the suretyship of Christ, like His atonement, is particular. If there were no preceding election, it would necessarily be universal. Moreover, to turn this around would be equivalent to making the suretyship of Christ the ground of election, while Scripture bases election entirely on the good pleasure of God.' p 268"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"This Systematic Theology by Berkhof is a gem. Get it. Check it out at the library or purchase it by clicking on that yellow button, or buy it & support a Confessional Reformed Seminary by hopping on to the WestminsterSeminary book store website and buy it (it's probably cheaper there).There are two copies. The Banner of truth will not wear and tear, it's a glued cloth hard back. But the thing is it's missing the classic Richard Muller introduction and a beginning chapter.In my opinion, it would be tough for any systematic theology work to beat this one. Again I say \\"in my opinion\\" the only systematic theology that would replace this one would have to be a theologian with the same level of scholarship and care as Berkhof. Someone who is Machen-like and Confessionaly Reformed (Three Forms, Westminster Standards).Why say more, the book has enough reviews. I'm just chiming in and giving this ST the five stars that it deserves so that maybe it could improve its overall 4 star status!Inwoo"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"I bought the hard copy of this classic work to attend a study group. It is huge and heavy, but the writing is phenomenal. I am profoundly in awe of Berkhof's ability to make Biblical concepts clear, and also analyzed so thoroughly. He thinks of angles of view that I never would have come up with, but it give a holographic perception that I can ponder, and that affects my everyday life. I am no theology professor or seminarian, but this stuff is just plain crucial to a deeper understanding of the ramifications of beliefs.

Its required reading in good conservative Christian colleges."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"This book is truly one of the Christian classics. Berkof was a man of towering intelect and deep spiritual sensitivity. One can only profit from a serious study of this great work and contribution to Christian literature."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Berkhof presented in-depth treatment of the full range of Christian theology. His thoroughness can be seen in every topic he covers. But his writing style is not the easiest to follow. He throws around a lot of terms and names that one not familiar with Christian theology and history might not know. But for the more advanced student of the Christian faith, expending the effort to understand Berkhof's will prove to be fruitful.Berkhof very strongly presents a Reformed viewpoint. But the section on this subject really only constitutes a small percentage of the total work. Berkhof deals with all aspects of the Christian faith in as much depth as he does the Reformed view of salvation.One area where I disagree with Berkhof is in regards to baptism. He present an infant baptism perspective while I believe in believer's baptism. But this is the only major disagreement I would have with Berkhof. So I would recommend this volume, but not as one's primary or only theology.I would recommend consulting volumes like Lewis and Demarest's \\"Integrative Theology\\" or Erickson's \\"Systematic Theology\\" first, and Berkhof's only secondarily for comparison purposes. You might also want to consult my \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible\\" for aid in studying various theological topics."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Professor Berkhof, who was the President of Calvin Seminary and professor of Systematic Theology at the same in the first half of the twentieth century, has given us an excellent compendium of Reformed theological thought in this hefty volume. The subject is treated in the classical style, moving through the Doctrines of God, Man in Relation to God, the Person and Work of Christ, the Application of the Work of Redemption, the Church and the Means of Grace, and the Last Things.His treatment of the Doctrine of God covers a lot of territory, but leaves something to be desired in covering the Attributes of God. His chapter on the Trinity, however, is most helpful.He is decidedly Calvinistic in his approach to soteriology, giving an excellent treatment of the classical Reformed view of the &quot;doctrines of grace.&quot; His chapters on the Atonement are among the best in Reformed theology; and his chapters on the respective parts of the Application of Redemption (regeneration, conversion, justification, sanctification, etc.) are helpful.His doctrine of the Church is Presbyterian to the last, which is a demerit to the book, in my judgment. The final section on Last Things gives a helpful overview of futurist eschatalogy, with Berkhof rejecting premillenialism. His critique of Dispensationalism is helpful (and scathing!).The strength of the book is its clear coverage of the Reformed position. At times it is too brief, especially when dealing with divergent views of the various subjects - but that is almost necessary in a book like this.The greatest fault of the book is the author's lack of actual exegesis of texts. Most of his theology is sound, but his exegetical defense of it is not as clear as one could desire. Too often the passages are only referenced in brackets with little or no quotation. Hence, one could easily read this book and become a Reformed theologian without knowing how to use the Bible to substantiate his or her beliefs.That notwithstanding, this is a book to be read and studied by pastors and theologians. It is not the only book on theology to be digested, but it is a key one."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"This should be next to your copy of John Calvin's &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;.

It is nice, in the new compilation, to have both the &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;. I agree that you need both publications and having them in one volume is handy.I agree about the binding. It is sturdy enough (5 stars), but it is not &quot;user friendly&quot; (3 stars). The text nearly runs into the binding and its smaller size makes it hard to hold without it closing on itself. This makes it tough to read, holding it in hand while eating lunch.

I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar. This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.Where do I start? First off, the font size is terrible. So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant. Then comes the print type. It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage. The printing is extremely bad. Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy. Was the typeset dirty? Did you run out of ink? True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus. But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers.

Dr. Berkhof leaves no stone untouched as he covers every aspect of systematic theology from God's inerrant and infalliable Word to the end times. His chapters on predestination are well worth the price of the book.The drawback to these books is the publisher and not the author. The books are so small that the binding tends to crack easily and the book will not lie open for you to read and write without holding the page where you are located. The poor binding is my only reasoning for giving this book a 4 star rating.

One question that is before every man is &quot;How is a man justified before his God?&quot; Berkhof covers the doctrine of Justification in a succint yet thorough manner. Throughout the book Berkhof combines Scripture with logical thinking. He also offers opposing and varying views so the reader can beware. This book is not to be neglected, but should be used as both a tool for reference, as well as a tool for personal growth and knowledge. It is not for the collection of dust."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"This is a systematic theology reference book, and about as thorough a one you'll find in one volume. For the uninitiated, what that means is that it deals with theology on a subject by subject basis, rather than looking at it in a book of the Bible by book of the Bible basis. The great thing about that is that if you want to know all of the major Biblical passages and arguements about any given topic, you just look it up in the index, and there it is!This is a reference book for serious students of the Bible, who really want to know their stuff. While it might be a bit too heavy for everyone to own a copy, anyone with a church or congregation out there should certainly get one for your library.The position Berkhof writes from is certainly a reformed, orthodox, Christian one, and he manages to have a balanced and correct view, I think, on most things. That said, I don't agree with absolutely everything he says - for instance, I agree with the other reviewer on infant baptism. It just goes to show that no-one should ever rely on any one single theology book as a guide, but should consult as many as possible, read the Bible passages carefully, consider the arguements, and then, prayerfully, make up your own mind. Thankfully, Berkhof writes in a relaxed, although technical, style, and doesn't get uptight about contentious issues.If I had to have just one systematic theology book, though (and I hope that doesn't sound too ridiculous - there must be people out there reading this asking &quot;why would anyone want ANY systematic theology book?), then this is the one to go for. If you want an introduction to theology, then there is a (much) shorter version of this book available, but its just a starter. Where it leads to is this, frankly, monumental work."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Berkhof's work itself is an essential document for the thinking Christian. With much of what one sees going on today, this is put into even sharper relief. This particular publishing is the \`New Combined Edition', giving you a lengthy introductory work as well as the work proper, topping it out at over 900 pp. But the publishers cast it in a small book format. You have to forcibly hold the book open to read it. I would suggest getting the The Banner of Truth edition but I don't know if it will include the introduction."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"This is without a doubt the most concise and yet thorough and thoughtful systematic theology that is available.

I do not know what the publisher was thinking. The reader can hardly read the entire page because the book is so difficult to lay flat. The book almost seems to be spring-loaded it is so tight, and closes so quickly - watch your fingers. I would suggest finding an older copy from another publisher.

It is clear these events marked the point in his life at which Malcolm X turned towards Islam.I highly recommend this book which was written in 1946 for anyone who would like to understand Islam in a very simplified and practical approach that offers a view for a better world.Amazingly, the author of this book Abdel Rahman Azzam Pasha is no ordinary writer. A dedicated and balanced statesman and a fierce warrior and officer at the Ottoman Army who has led and organized the Libyans struggle against the invading Italian troops and one of the very few men who actually made the \\"Arab League\\" foundation come true, which entitled him to become its first Secretary General. Abdel Rahman Azzam Pasha was also a minister in Egypt and a soldier in the Balkan and alongside other former Ottoman officers were trying to re-organize the Arab world based on idealistic Islamic views to unite arabs.Reading this book in 2008, over 60 years since it was written; the book still makes great sense and is indeed eternal in its own rights for being able to still practically offer a better view for a world system based on faith, right and justice. Furtheremore, Azzam Pasha in his introduction of the book says: even if you don't agree with Islam or God, you could still find a very meaningful theory that can actually solve our modern world problems."},{"Title":"Eternal Message of Muhammad","review":"The book was never inteneded for the western reader but rather for the Muslim reader over 30 years ago. Its aim was to bring the message of Islam to the modern Muslim in a style that he/she could understand and practice in their day to day lives. Thus, not only the fundamentals of belief are explained but also social and political issues that were effecting the Muslim world at the time. It is said that Malcolm X was given a copy of this book and it had a great effect on him brining him towards Sunni Islam.It should be pointed out that the author was an Arab nationalist and so there are without doubt points in the book which are not shall we say, orthodox.

Elizabeth Janeway leads us to re-examine the nature and uses of power-\\"that ambiguous, menacing, much-desired quality, whose accepted definitions seem to me unsatisfactory.\\" With striking effect, she chooses to analyze the power relationship not in terms of the strong (who traditionally get all the attention), but of the powerless-and above all of \\"the oldest, largest and most central group of human creatures in the wide category of the weak and the ruled\\": women. It is a fascinating approach, and superbly fruitful. We start with the infant, epitome of the powerless, learning to impose his or her small will-and in turn developing a sense of the power structures that will govern later life, and the lives of others. We examine childhood problems that range from nightmares to autism-and see how they are in fact power disorders that help explain similar disorders elsewhere. (The isolation of an autistic child, deliberately choosing a destructive self-image and definitions of life that are simply not true, finds a parallel in the desperate situation of certain \\"ordinary\\" women.) Here are considerations of dreams as a route into the inner world, \\"where the developing self wrestles with the demands made on it by external reality \\" . . . of the workings of power within the political process, from Louis XIII spanked by his tutor to Lyndon Johnson driven out of office (\\"the image of 'Big Daddy' became that of the ogre eating his young\\")... of the \\"magic connection\\" between power and the supernatural, which tends to validate the idea that the powerful have a right to their power and suggests why to many people power is a fearful, even repellent, thing... of theposition of the weak in \\"extreme conditions\\"-subjected to despotism, living in prison camps, as rebels or martyrsof \\"terrorism as theater.\\" Here is rich intellectual adventure crowded with stimulating ideas, carrying us to the conclusion that the powers of the weak are not only real, but central to any attempt to rearrange social relationships in a humane and positive manner. Mrs. Janeway points the ways to such rearrangement, via the key powers that are always available to the \\"powerless\\" if they have the courage to use them: disbelief -which begins with a refusal to accept the definition of oneself proclaimed by the strong-and coming together, the readiness to join with others in opposition. She demonstrates how these principles can be put to work in the realm of practical politics-and then takes an exciting leap into what she calls \\"impractical politics\\" to showhow women, by valuing and expressing their natural talents, can and must reshape and civilize the entire pattern of power.Elizabeth Janeway writes as a woman who sees, with clarity and imagination, how the so-called \\"women's issues\\" are in fact issues of power and the misuse of power and hence issues affecting society as a whole. By bringing us to a far more basic and functional understanding of how power really works, Powers of the Weak arms us against its diminishing effects and offers the promise of a better and fairer life for everyone.Elizabeth Janeway is author of Man's World, Woman's Place and Between Myth and Morning, as well as six novels and four children's books. She is a director of the Author's Guild and a trustee of Barnard College. She and her husband, the economist and author Eliot Janeway, live in New York City."},{"Title":"Stars of the Desert","review":"A collection of poems, many with Arabian themes and settings, including several substantial love poems about or addressed to males: &#65533;To Aziz&#65533; (&#65533;Your beauty puts a barb into my soul&#65533;), &#65533;Song of the Enfifa River&#65533; (&#65533;In Memory of Abdullah, drowned at sixteen... .

Benchley has been my lunch companion on numerous occasions, and he never fails to please. One of the greatest humorists America has ever produced, in the same league with Mark Twain and James Thurber."},{"Title":"My ten years in a quandary and how they grew,","review":"I recall this book from our cottage forty years ago and still have it. These are wonderful flights of wit and fancy from one of the great humorous writers. I've read many of these essays and stories dozens of times now and they never grow stale. How McGregor lost a locomotive on the way home, fur-bearing trout, and the dangers of bass singing are just a few of the topics covered."},{"Title":"My ten years in a quandary and how they grew,","review":"This book offers an array of emotions and feelings in a quirky little package. From the first time I picked up this book from the spare bedroom at my grandparents' old home, I knew I'd found a rare jem of a book. As my brother told me I was &quot;a monster of a girl,&quot; a kept reading and reading until Sherman, the fiend of the Sea, chased me to the lake. These are the kind of feelings that this book brings out in people. From its terse discussion on the history of Budapest, to its harsh realization that there really were more than two composers named &quot;Mozart,&quot; I believe all will find this an enjoyable experience!"},{"Title":"My ten years in a quandary and how they grew,","review":"This is fun at its best! It is a pity that Benchley is not read more widely. This book takes us to extremes : it is crazy and &quot;farfelu&quot;.

This is my favorite of all the collections, and I guess I like MacGregor the best."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"This book deals with the Reconstruction period, 1865-77. Bowers is of the older school that found the Radical Republicans, led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, with their ideas of punishing the South for seceeding and forcing equality for blacks in the South, especially at the polls, were disastrous for the South. This view has been hotly debated; for a revisionist view see Stampp's \\"The Era of Reconstruction.\\" Bowers, despite his controversial views, is an interesting historian: his style is personal and flamboyant. His emphasis is on tragedy, and his tone echoes that sentiment. To him Andrew Johnson was fighting the good fight of A. Lincoln and sought moderation in black suffrage and ease at allowing Southerners to become US citizens again; Stevens et. al. were evil monsters. An interesting book, nowhere dull."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"Claude Bowers, The Tragic Era, is a brilliant politically incorrect history of the most corrupt time in the history of the United States. Bowers starts with the assumption of the Presidency of Andrew Johnson, a heroic but much maligned man in history. Johnson was a staunch Unionist and patriot, but he was also an avid believer in Jeffersonian government. He correctly saw the centralization of power by the Republican Party as dangerous to freedom.Next Bowers delves into the \\"Radical Republicans\\" led by Thaddeus Stevens, a vicious fanatic and a man who despised white Southerners. Stevens, an ardent aboitionist and crusader for negro equality, hated the South and it's white population. He wanted \\"Reconstruction\\" to be as harsh and unforgiving as could be. Overall a true scoundrel. Next we see the abolitionist fanaticism of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. Sumner,as radical as Stevens also hated southern whites and was a fanatic for negro equality. Sumner, like all Radical Republicans, wanted immediate equality of the races, negro voting( even when most could not read or write), disenfanchisement of all whites, and Southern governments dominated by carpetbaggers and negroes. These carpetbaggers, along with negroes and southern \\"scalawags\\" plundered the South.Also exposed is the lunacy and fanaticism of the abolitionists. Beloved today, they were seen as a threat to southern whites and as proponents of a bloody race war. William Lloyd Garrison, a modern hero, was Puritan of the worst stripe. He called the US Constitution a \\"covenant with death\\" and encouraged blacks to rise against the whites. Left out of modern histories of the era is the scandalous and sick call for extermination, not just of slaveholders, but of all southern whites. New England clergymen were the main culprits. This was borne out of religious fanaticism of the most extreme fundamentalist type: uncomprimising, violent, and hateful.The phony politically motivated impeachment of Johnson, the military governing of the South, the bribery, corruption, and violence perpetrated on southern whites shows a time of disgrace and despotism. The instigating of race tensions and war by Republican governors, and their lies, and promises to freed slaves that they would give whites land to them caused innumerable tensions throughout the South.Lastly the stolen election of 1876 where the votes of three states, Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina were manipulated causing the election of Rutherford B. Hayes. The Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden, won the popular vote by 260,000 votes and more than likely the real electoral votes. In order to make a comprimise the Republican Party ended Reconstruction,and pulled federal troops out of the South.This is a very politically incorrect, but accurate history, unlike the deconstructionist and anti-southern histories of today. It also shows that the Republican Party began as a party of Big Government and looking at today, still is.Overall, a great read."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"I can only say that it is difficult reading, due to the over whelming amount of graft and political corruption of that era. They made some of today's political corruptions seem mild by comparison! I have a personal letter from one of Kentucky's Representatives of that era, and he compares much of what was going on in Washington, D.C., to a cesspool of coruption. Mr. Lincoln's war to change the voluntary confederated union of sovereign states into a consolidated \\"Nation\\" of people en masse, opened the door, and the Radical Republicans (who made today's liberal Democrats look good)were only too glad to pour through it! They went far beyond what Lincoln had in mind, and we are not likely to ever get over it! Actually, some historians seem to suggest that opposition to their extreme policies might have contributed to his assasination, as well as the impeachment of President Johnson! Interesting to ponder on, to say the least! An important book about a subject which many would prefer to keep behind the closet door, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"This book dealt more with the crooked politics of the reconstruction era. It did not tell much about the hardships the people of the south had to endure due to the low lifes from the north."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"As both an author and a historian, I have to say THE TRAGIC ERA is simply the best book ever written on The Reconstruction and the post-War for Southern Independence Era -- period. Written well before either publisher or self-censorship due to political correctness became the norm, this book pulls no punches whatsoever as it lays out the cold hard truth about this vital period in history when the partial reintegration of the South into the US was less important than the fundamental changes in the US Government itself. Race, politics and personalities of the time are all handled with equal bluntness, with truth being the author's only concern. If you have not read this book, you cannot understand either that period in history or the current one. Yes, it is just that important, and of equal importance, it is highly readable.Gregory Kay, author ofThe Third RevolutionSeries."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"To read this account of Author Bowers is a trek into bewilderment. One wonders how on earth the US and the defeated Confederacy ever reconciled. Radical, vindictive Union politicians were more interested in grinding assunder even more, if possible, the flattened South. They had the mentality of gangland vendettas. Not a way to reunite in brotherhood, as Lincoln would have sought, and Andrew Johnson too. Radical Republicans really seem to manifest in this book a certain glee that Lincoln was 'out of the way' so they could vent their vengeance on Southerners.I read a book on the life of the former Postmaster General of the Confederacy, John Heminger Reagan. What an amazing man for political justice and the human rights of 'common' people, a long time fighter against big business tycoons! If one reads \\"Not Without Honor: the Life of John H. Reagan\\" in conjunction with \\"The Tragic Era\\" it really educates us how croniism ruled the years of Reconstruction+. You detest the devilish personalities in Tragic Era, would like to smack them around a bit, tar and feather them and run them out of American history. Then, on the other hand, you marvel and admire individuals like Reagan as he championed individual rights in Texas, striving years against those reprehensible types in the Tragic Era. Thanks to Reagan you can rejoice for the Interstate Commerce Act, which restricted the railroad monopolies and those detestable agendas of Radical Republicanism in the 19th century.We have not had a recent Civil War. But, we can still see elements of our contemporary Congress resembling the post Civil War / Reconstruction / Federal Occupation era. How did the USA North & South ever reconcile!?"},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"Excellent - one of the best books on Reconstruction. Beautifully written, and politically incorrect. For any student of the period, this volume is a must. It is the conservative equivalent to Eric Foner's history. For the most middle-of-the-road approach, though, pick up Robert Self Henry's \\"Story of Reconstruction,\\" too."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"This book is a vital read for those who truly want to know how much vicious hatred was inflicted upon the defenseless South after the Confederacy was defeated. In truth, the Germans and Japanese were treated far better than our fellow Southern Americans! Also,as a result of the Radical Republican rule for over 10 years, the entire country was transformed from a former Constitutional Republic into the Mobocracy that we have today. The South was right!"},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"The politically correct can moan all they want about \\"how\\" Bowers says what he says, but they cannot refute WHAT he says. What he says actually happened. Buy the book. It's worth it. And if you've been previously brainwashed by the \\"contemporary\\" view (or as one reviewer put it, the \\"rose colored\\" view) of Reconstruction, ask yourself a common sense question before you begin reading.... How is it that a people not more than 2 years removed from slavery, most of whom could not read and write, most of them now on their own for the first time in their lives, find not only the expertise necessary to run for and hold political office, but the free time? Such a leap of progress in such a short time has never occurred in the annals of human history?!When you fail to find a logical answer for the question, then the smoke and mirrors imposed on your brain by the \\"contemporary\\" view of the period should begin to fade away like a bad dream. Then you are ready to see the truth."},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"This will really refresh your attitude to the tragic era it really shows what it was all about!"},{"Title":"The Tragic Era","review":"The author used extensive research.

Even though it was packed with information, it flowed and reading it was quite fast. There's only one problem I had with it - when it had a title or quote in another language, sometimes the Kindle couldn't translate it, and it bugged me cause there were two or three that in order to understand what the author meant by it, I would need to know the translation.

Although mostly dedicated to expression of the male nude, the female form is also represented. All the photo's are beautifully reproduced, and presented in a first class fashion. I have owned this book for almost a year now, and always find something new and interesting to see with each examination. In fact, because of this book,I have become very interested in not only Platt Lynes, but also in his contempoary friends and fellow artists. Paul Cadmus,a wonder painter, presented well in &quot;Collaboration: Photographs by Paul Cadmus, Jared and Margaret French&quot;. And also Gorden Westcot, and Monroe Wheeler. Be sure to check out, &quot;When We Were Three&quot;, the love story of three gay men living their bohemian lives in the mid 1900's....just wonderful!"},{"Title":"George Platt Lynes Photographs 1931 1955","review":"I am not just a collector of photography books, I also collect art photography and my collection is made richer and fuller with 7 photographs by George Platt Lynes: a few portraits, one fashion shot and several works done for Balanchine's New York City Ballet. This book is beautifully produced with some magnificent photographs. Lynes' life story is not a happy one: in love with a man who was killed in WW2, finding more success with his fashion photography than with his &quot;artier,&quot; more creative photographs, death at an early age by cancer with a large percentage of his work unpublished. This volume goes far in reaching a public which should be able to see the work of this man who was an obvious influence for later photographers like Robert Mapplethorpe."},{"Title":"George Platt Lynes Photographs 1931 1955","review":"Old photos from someone who really had 'the eye'.The book new is very expensive.....There is renewed interest in his work....thanks"},{"Title":"From My Son's Garden","review":"This book was a duplication of my own loss. I experienced many of the same emotions. From My Son's Garden visited areas that have not been shared in other resources. This book brought a parent's grief to a personal level. There were never any words that could adequately describe the grief one experiences when a child dies, but every emotion, every feeling, every thought, no matter how bizarre was addressed. I think we abstain from sharing the bizarre because we feel others might think we are odd. What a wonderful tribute to Joby, by his mom sharing her pain with others in pain."},{"Title":"From My Son's Garden","review":"This one &#34;didn't do it for me&#34;, after I lost my second child.

The \\"new normal\\" is something that \\"is\\" and we are having to accept it step by step because it is here.The love and memories will always be here to cherish."},{"Title":"Fire is Favorable to the Dreamer","review":"If you buy one poetry book in the year 2003, make it Fire Is Favorable to the Dreamer, by Susan Terris. Sorrows of everyday life discover their niches, then move beyond the mundane into a world where grief itself teaches us to harbor the light within. Among my favorite poems were \\"Breaking Away From the Family\\" in which the author remembers her father's death: \\"Mother's pork sausage fingers\\" and the \\"stiff portrait\\" of five faces left behind.Terris is a poet with the gift of understatement and grace. Stark, emotional realities are made into art and laced with a hint of mystery. Her readers will meet death, cancer, the roles of men and women, and growing up -- all in compelling new ways. Section three (entitled Blue Roses) is reminiscent of Tennessee Williams' famous play The Glass Menagerie, where light affords studious appraisal of one's life and mortal limits. Terris is one of the most profound and eloquent new voices in Amercian poetry today.Janet I. Buck, author of Calamity's Quilt"},{"Title":"Fire is Favorable to the Dreamer","review":"FIRE IS FAVORABLE TO THE DREAMER is a lively and interesting book of poems. These are not poems so obscure that the reader has no idea what the poet is saying but poems about love and loss. There are personal poems of love and loss, but much of the book is narrative poems about real people such as Mary Todd Lincoln, Picasso, or the sailors of the Russian submarine the Kursk. In contrast to these poems, some of the work is surreal and has the aura of myth or fairy tale. This is a collection of immense breadth and depth. I meant to open it and read a few poems but found myself reading on and on. I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"The Unknown Rilke","review":"In the very fine introduction to this book, Wright draws Rilke parallel to a comment about Rimbaud: &quot;(he) was neither a seer or a prophet nor a god: he was a poet, *that is enough*.&quot; Rilke is one of the West's major poets, no matter how far back in time you go. Period. And if you think you know the poet, but you haven't read these poems, these clear &amp; wise translations... You don't know Rilke.I have no idea why this book is not better known. I myself was turned onto it by the provocative author Jonathan Carroll, in one of his fine novels. Yes, this contains some fragmentary, unfinished poems Rilke was working on during difficult periods of his life. Yes, some are reflections on Biblical characters. But they transcend the subject the same as Rilke transcends most other poets' ideas of poetry - where it can go, where it can take you, both as reader and as writer. Rilke exemplified, intentionally or not, a new vision of human consciousness, where it fits in relation to everything else. In Rilke, as with most great poetry (and most great art), it is not so much paying attention to his words when you read him - if poetry comes to you, it will come between the words, in the spaces you find yourself creating for it to fill, in a certain accumulation of insight and wisdom. In this, Rilke is one of the world's rare geniuses.This edition presents mostly unpublished work completed or abandoned during the last two decades of Rilke's life. It is full of presentiments and &quot;echoes&quot; of his final masterwork, Duino Elegies. These rank among some of his finest, most lucid - if fragmentary - works. The honesty of Rilke's insight is sometimes stunning, heartbreaking, breath-stopping.From the introduction: &quot;'Life and death,' [Rilke wrote], 'at the core they are one.' Rilke was seeking the angel: not to woo him, he acknowledged - and in whose ears, if he cried out, he might not be heard at all; the angel, not the Christian angel, but a noun which has no corresponding entity in space, and yet exists for us by virtue of that noun, of language itself: exists in us, in perceiving and being perceived, in whatever impulse it was that first caused human beings to speak, to sing, to praise. The poems in [the last section of this edition] were some of Rilke's milestones, or precarious footholds and handholds on that desolate mountain of the heart...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Unknown Rilke","review":"Wright does what few who dare to translate Rilke do: while remaining true to the often dazzlingly complex German, he brings the text once again to life in an English that is up to the original - and that is high praise, indeed. Perhaps only poets of the stature of Franz Wright should dare to do this near-impossible task of translating Rilke. It is an immaculate conception in English, and for those without recourse to the original a more than adequate compensation."},{"Title":"Lula and The Workers' Party in Brazil","review":"In 2002 when Lula was first elected President, some people thought he was a radical and a leftist. Now in 2010, eight years later, nobody really knows how to categorize Lula but most people had to recognize his qualities as an intuitive political character and a bright reformer.He is everything but a radical since during his Presidency he always tried to achieve things without confronting adversaries and even political enemies.How about the PT (Workers Party)? Born from a bunch of non Communist labor leaders (like Lula himself), leftist Catholics, Trotskyites and intellectuals the party had the goal of electing Lula President but now that Lula is leaving the Presidency with record popularity the party has the difficult task of reinventing itself. What do we want now? Who are we? Are we still Socialists? How many people are still following us?The world has changed, Brazil has changed (a lot), Lula has changed and PT has changed. Inequalities have decreased, that's for sure, but they're still huge.This book by Sue Brandford and Bernardo Kucinsky is very helpful to anybody who wants to understand the origins of Lula and the PT and try to guess where Brazil is going to be in the next 10 or 20 years."},{"Title":"Lula and The Workers' Party in Brazil","review":"The election of Ignacio Lula da Silva as Brazilian president in October 2004 was cheered in Brazil and abroad. In Brazil there was finally hope of social change. Outside Brazil Lula's rags to riches story, combined with the uncertain behaviour of the financial markets should he be elected, led to special interest.On the wave of optimism following Lula's comfortable second round victory, Sue Branford and Bernardo Kucinsky with help from Hilary Wainwright wrote this book about Lula and his workers' party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT). All three of the writers are firmly left wing and start from the assumption that PT is different and better than all other political parties, making a critical analysis impossible.Each writer contributes his own chapter, resulting in a collection of articles and not a coherent book. The first chapter tells the story of the PT from its origins in the mass strikes in the Sao Paolo area in the late seventies to the 2002 elections. The second chapter starts in Ca&eacute;tes with Lula's humble origins and joins the PT story when Lula becomes the undisputed leader of the Sao Paolo strikes. The most interesting chapter covers the economic developments in Brazil in the 1990's, in which the IMF and the international banks are the villains. In the last chapter Hillary Wainwright visits Porto Alegre to see the system the ruling PT has established to listen to the wishes of its citizens.The book also contains profiles of emblematic PT members like Marina who first went to school aged 16 and now is Minister of the Environment and black favela dweller Benedita de Silva. People like this and Lula himself are the PT's best claim to uniqueness.Two years after his victory it's clear that real change is difficult to accomplish. Lula himself admitted Any profound change is not easy in our country. And the PT is behaving more and more like the other Brazilian political parties."},{"Title":"Lula and The Workers' Party in Brazil","review":"This book was written in 2002, so it is dated. It predicts how Lula will act in his presidency, and I think the authors did a good job of detailing what would happen. Lula maintained some of the policies of HC, but changed on the social front. His presidency was a contradiction. He talked of advancing the poor classes in Brazilian society, but kept some of the rich technocrats in office in the financial ministry. Overall, Brazil has a booming economy and their oil deals may signal the advancement of Brazil into the reaches of an India/China economic powerhouse.Lula certainly advanced Brazil during his years in office. I think he has done a better job than people such as Chavez, Morales, or the Sandinistas. Brazil will develop into a rich multi ethnic country and exert powerful influences in Central and South America. This is a good read on a complex subject."},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond, esq (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Fiction)","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve years old and re-read it every ten years. It is one of the greatest historical novels ever written. On the surface it is a memoir of Henry Esmond, an illegitimate son of a nobleman, who survives a turbulent era in which religious and political factions fight for control of England around 1700.But the book is much more than that. It is a complex and romantic family drama in which the illegitimate son, Henry Esmond, plays a key role in preserving the rest of his father's family from various dangers that stalk them in a dissolute uppper-class society where no nobleman's money or wife is safe from his debauched fellow aristocrats.Henry falls in love with two of his beautiful female relatives, and must make a painful choice in the end between the two women. He is also faced with a major moral dilemma when a secret about his own birth tilts the balance of power within his father's family.The book faithfully mimics the language and style of the early 18th century, but is very readable. It has a lot of humor and satire -- duels and love affairs are interrupted by gentle mockery of upper-class pretensions and vices.Henry Esmond is a very likeable hero, an orphaned bastard of a commoner and a nobleman, who struggles to find a place for himself in a society with rigid class barriers and who sees the society around him with the eyes of both his commoner mother and his arrogant father. By the close of the novel he has to make a choice--whether to continue dealing with the hypocrisy and corruption of the British upper classes of that era and their deadly political games or flee to the American colonies. He must also choose which woman he will finally give his heart to."},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond, esq (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Fiction)","review":"I was amazed to see that no one has yet reviewed this book, under any publisher, here on amazon. That a classic such as this should be so long neglected is truly remarkable.I must confess that I am very displeased with this book. This is not because it had poor characters, was poorly written, had a bad plot, etc. It is because of the last ten or so pages of the book. Almost the whole book is describing the things Henry Esmond, a truly noble and good man, is doing to try to win the favor of Beatrix Esmond, his cousin whom he wishes to marry (remember that marriage laws were quite different when this takes place, nearly 300 years ago). He accomplishes much, sacrafices more, and it looks as if he is getting closer and closer to finally winning her heart. Then, in the last ten pages, she runs off with the prince he was helping regain his throne, and Henry Esmond decides he no longer loves her, marries her mother (basically his adopted mother), moves to America, and declares that he is far happier with his wife than he would have been with Beatrix. I can live with an unhappy ending. This would have made an excellent tragedy. What I am angry about is the way the author portrays the ending. The fact that the author tries to pass it off as a happy ending annoys me to no end. I stayed up until six in the morning to finish this book, only to be left with the most unsatisfying ending to a book that I can ever recall reading.Besides this, it is a good book. Great, epic? No, but good. The details of life in 18th century England, the attempts to return the Stuart kings to the throne, the tension between the Catholics and the Protestants, and the military battles of the time were all very good, and fun to read about. The characters were well done, and the detials of the life of Henry Esmond, from childhood to middle aged, were very well put together.Overall grade: B"},{"Title":"This is Your Birth","review":"We found this book to be a little shocking, but almost exactly what we saw in the long time we were in the hospital. I had to be on bedrest in a hospital for a long time because my water broke early. Theres a story like mine in this book, and other ones that I saw happening around me too. The birth classes don't tell you the stuff you need to know as much as this book does.

I read this book after the birth, and was amazed at the multiple attitudes about birth. Although this is fiction, the various cases obviously represent real types. We had approached birth from a completely natural, out-of-hospital attitude. However, our son was a week overdue and close to 10 pounds, so that wasn't going to happen. The first eye opener was actually giving birth...the second eye opener was finding out through this book that our experience was anything but unique. This is a quick, but very enlightening book."},{"Title":"Fangs","review":"Fangs...you think werewolf, and of course because of the notorious Stephen King you also think rabid dog. Definitly not that. You also hear about the kids that were raised by wolves and those stories always got my attention. Of course the Jungle Book shows the affection side of it for our children's sake but this book goes right down to the facts of what it would be like. The ups and downs, the savagery and the close affection and communial aspects of a pack of wolves. That makes for an interesting story all on its own. But then to add the mating of the wolves creation to a murderer, the outcome brings a whole new twist on things. I love the way the arthur mixes the times together and at first you wonder where it is going but in the end it plays together so well. I have never seen an arthur use that technique before and thought it was excellent. Anyone who has driven through a real country town could also relate to this scary story. I have gone through a town in the mountains that made me scared and i will go miles out of my way to avoid passing through there again. Which seeing that allows me to believe that the story could happen. The whole towns structure and way of life paralled to the life of a pack of wolves but maybe worse. The thought is scary and beyond."},{"Title":"Fangs","review":"If you're expecting some type of werewolf/slavering beast type o' book then yer gonna get a surprise. Imagine, if you will, the Texas Chainsaw Masscre done as a generation spanning saga. This is great pulp!

Treat yourself!"},{"Title":"Fangs","review":"I read Fangs years ago and it was a book that I thought about a lot afterward, and it was also one of the rare books that I have actually kept in my collection all these years. Years after reading it, I randomly picked up Bishop's Landing and was blown away by that one as well. It wasn't until I was going through my stacks while I was partway through Bishop's Landing that I put together that the same guy had written both of these books that I really loved.Richard Forsythe, in my opinion, is the most overlooked author of my lifetime. Who is this guy? There is absolutely nothing about him anywhere on the internet. I can't help but wonder about the guy who wrote three books that blew me away and then disappeared completely. Was he a pen name for another author?I was even curious enough to try to contact his publishers to see if I could dig anything up. The publisher of his first two books replied to me, but said that they had switched office buildings (or were bought out or something like that) and no longer had any records from before that time and didn't have any information to give me. The publisher of his third book WAS bought out and they didn't even bother to reply to my inquiries.But anyway, the book was awesome and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Modern power politics: cold war;: A study","review":"Very good book.

The only time she shed a tear was when her (married) son kicked the bucket because of his bad heart while in the sack with another lady. After he croaked she then basically ex-communicated her daughter-in-law, and her grandchildren.Also according to the story, her personal assistant who was often at her side, was asked to wipe her shoes clean with a rag like a shoe-shine boy, in front of people. She also liked to snap her fingers at people when she wanted things brought to her, or wanted someone to do something for her.Then there's Mr. Helmsley. Another multi-millionaire with ample business acumen who lacked street smarts and contemporary social skills. (Doh! Where ya been Harry?) Leona set the trap: after their affair had schemingly precipitated to deeper emotional depths over time, the queen told Mr. H that another man had offered to marry her, and she showed him a fake diamond engagement ring he allegedly bought for her. None of this was true. But Harry fell for it. Leona made an ultimatum that it was now or never. All or nothing. She was not going to be the second banana in his life. The queen persuaded Harry to leave his wife of 33 years for her. He soon discovered what he was in for: a clingy nagger.This is New York. He was a very wealthy man. He could have simply called a guy in Queens or Brooklyn named \\"Vito,\\" and for about $50,000 her could have had her....but no. He put up with her because he was P-whipped.Leona is gutsy and to the bone, and nothing ventured means nothing gained in life. But, the queen turned ambition into a sadistic perversion of making people miserable to inflate her ego. There are assertions that this was out of emotional neglect, or lack of emotional support from her mother when she was a child. Leona's mother, it seems favored Leona's older sister. Let's call out Dr. Freud, May, Rogers, Adler, or Phil McGraw.After she schemed to marry and control Mr. Helmsley, she made all clear that she had the power to hire, buy, intimidate, and fire anyone at will. Before she nabbed Harry, her first major promotion in real-estate sales was a result of a performance on the casting couch with her boss who had the power and ability to promote her within Mr. H's company.One tid-bit the author noted, was that part of her advertising promotion for one of her major hotels was to have a full deck of cards with 52 different pictures of her on each of them them. When the advertising company returned with the finished sample, previously approved by Leona, she snapped. She wanted the cards bigger, (bigger than regulation cards), and with gold edging. One by one she threw each one on the floor, and then told the advertising representatives, \\"have you ever played 52-pick-up. Now pick them up.\\"In her late 70s now, with time running out and Harry six-feet deep, the \\"queen of mean\\" recently donated a million dollars to a Christian organization for the \\"disadvantaged.\\" She claims she did this not to improve her image, but because it was the \\"right thing to do.\\" You fill in the blanks. The Queen hasn't got her Karma--yet. Her 4 year gig in the pen was heavily reduced."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"The unauthorized autobiography that Leona Helmsley rather you not read. Ransdell Pierson tells it all. How Leona Rosenthal was poor and wanted more and sought to get it any way she could, and was a conniving, scheming witch all the way up the Estate ladder to tricking her second husband (who she'd scratched off her \\"Royal Resume\\") to marry her, and her scheming to get Harry Helmsley to leave his wife and marry her. She was definitely the QUEEN OF HELMSLEY PALACE HOTEL. Her insensitivity extended from her family (her mother, sisters. ex-husbands, and son) to her hired help. She hovered over Harry Helmsley and made herself indespensible to him. Mr. Helmsley's brokers, friends and wife (his wife had degrees abound) wondered how Harry could turn his empire over to his second wife who dropped out of high school and faked her degrees. And then there's the tax fraud and evasion. Mrs. Leona Rosenthal Panzirer Lubin Helmsley thought it was BENEATH her station as a wealthy woman to pay taxes saying that \\"only the little people pay taxes\\".Very good read... well written by a man who wrote articles on the Helmsleys in the 1980s, with a look at how a street urchin schemed her way up to be the Queen of Helmsley Palace and the Queen of Mean that she still is to this day it seems, most recently as last year her constant firing of hired help made the papers again, as the hired help sued her for discrimination."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"That is what you'd probably feel after reading this tell all bio on the one and only Queen of the Palace, Leona Helmsley.The book documented in fascinating details on Leona's life. Leona was born Leona Rosenthal. If would be hard to believe now, but as a young woman, Leona was extraordinarily beautiful, as documented by the photos inserts which accompanied the book. Although she wasn't born rich, she WAS born with a fierce ambition which propelled her into being a successful career woman in real estate during a time when most women are secretaries, teachers or nurses.Being in the real estate business, she soon crossed path with Harry Helmsley, then married to his first wife Eve. A seperate chapter is dedicated to Harry and how he build his real estate empire.Ruthless and conniving Leona convinced Harry to separate from Eve and married her. Before her marriage to Helmsley, Leona was a competitive and cutthroat woman. Now with an empire at her fingertips, her pettiness and insensitivity reaches heights higher than the Empire State Building. The book is chock full of her frequent outbursts at her employees, associates, family, and acquaintances; as well as her strange personal habits and unusual mode of operandi (her hatred for Donald Trump is also well documented).The only redeeming quality it seems is Leona's motto that the customer is always right. The only people who she really give a second thought to are those who ultimately pay her bills.The bio ends with Leona being sentenced for tax evasion and a final tsk tsk jab at the Queen herself.The book is an entertaining read, except for the chapter on Harry Helmsley which you can skip without missing anything. And you will walk away knowing why a certain magazine called her the \\"Dungeons and Dragons Lady\\"."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"Piers Ransdell gives us here a very thorough, and thoroughly entertaining, look at Harry and Leona Helmsley. During her heyday, Leona never came across particularly well, and the ill will she generated in abundance eventually resulted in her landing in prison. Well, Ransdell gives us a portrait of a petty, vindictive, ill-willed woman who craved money and power and would do anything to get it. What's even better is it's so well researched: people interviewed include members of Leona's family, former co-workers, former employees of the Helmsley organization, Harry Helmsley's first wife, and Leona's two previous husbands. The portrait they paint is uniformly negative, almost to the point of being shocking. I was truly surprised at what a spineless man Harry was, and how cheap a billionaire(!) couple could actually be. The book is littered with episodes where the Helmsleys hire people to do work, the work gets done, and then they refuse to pay - for any reason, and frequently for no reason at all.Definitely an entertaining read. The Helmsleys and their lifestyle is interesting, and the author's style is engaging."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"Started reading this and could not put it down. I found myself re-reading some paragraphs because I found it amazing that someone really acted like this."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"Before I got into my review of this fascinating book I just wanted to make a correction. This book, \\"The Queen of Mean: The Unauthorized Biography of Leona Helmsley\\" was written by Ransdell Pierson; for whatever reason Amazon has the author's name incorrectly listed. The book is a total of 398 pages long and was first published in 1989 by Bantam books.This is a very detailed book that describes the rise and fall of billionaire, \\"Queen of Mean\\" Leona Helmsley very accurately and evenhanded. Although the book is an expos&eacute; it is not a hatchet job.I learned so much about this woman. The stories and the legends about her mean-spiritedness, money-hunger viper mentality are nothing compared to what's in this book. For the first time we get a close-up picture documented by some of the people that had the displeasure of knowing Mrs. Helmsley better than anyone else. The author interviewed just about everyone that knew Mrs. Helmsley; from former friends, husbands, business associates, family members and employees, and all had similar distasteful stories to divulge.Perhaps what I enjoyed most about \\"The Queen of Mean\\" is that Mr. Pierson was able to give an otherwise lifeless, shell of an individual some type of sentient qualities. Another interesting fact is that even though Mrs. Helmsley had more money than she knew what to do with she was never truly happy. The only pleasure she derived was making others as miserable as she was.The book went over and above my expecations because it was so meticiously researched by perhaps one of the journalists that knew more about the Queen than just about any other member of the media.Remember, a little compassion goes a very long way."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"Even all these years later, most of us remain fascinated with the story of hotelier Leona Helmsley. Her scandalous life story is beautifully told in this comprehensive work that is always entertaining for voyeurs of the \\"rich & famous criminals.\\" The horrible Helmsley still makes news for her bitchy behaviour and this is the book that thrust her into pop culture reknown, written by the reporter who would know best. A great read for fans of the bio/crime genre."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"I still believe that Leona Helmsley regardless of her notorious history of cruelty amongst her own employees and relatives was not the monster that the press sought her out to be. I keep thinking of comparing her to another wealthy, prominent female billionaire, Martha Stewart. The two women have a lot more in commmon. This book does provide a detailed back history of Leona's poverty life in Brooklyn to the rise of her wealth. It wasn't as if she married Harry Helmsley without dating him for a year and a half in an adulterous relationship. After all, she is human despite some people's notions. The book also writes about the close personal relationships with her. In the field of New York real estate business, you have no choice but to be ruthless, conviving, fearless, and brutal to get ahead. She was a woman in a man's world and an immediate outsider in that world. Her two prior marriages showed that Leona came first even with her son. Of course, there are some unforgiveable acts of cruelty towards her relatives, friends, business partners, and employees. Leona developed one of the best New York City hotels. The Helmsley Palace was that a palace and the Queen Leona ruled with an iron fist. She may have gone overboard at times with the cards and her photographs that surrounded. She was one of the most beautiful woman in the business industry. Beauty and brains never did go hand to hand with being a woman. Leona Helmsley succeeded without a college education that would impress even those with their fancy ivy league degrees like Donald Trump. Much like Martha Stewart, Leona Helmsley craved perfection as a necessity whether it was a product or a hotel service. The Helmsley Palace of Leona's days are long gone. Hotel services as customer service in our society is really under-appreciated in most places. Leona wanted first class and first rate services and quality for her customers. At the end of her life, the Helmsley estate left a billion dollar trust foundation for charitable purposes. I think I can forgive her cruelty when she has donated her mast fortune for others who she will never meet or get credit for all the good that she has done regardless of her intentions. Leona had never planned to keep her mast fortune as they might have said. She wasn't stupid to get ripped off by overpricing. I bet she would have made a great president, governor, mayor of New York City, etc. if she wanted too. She had the smarts to keep spending down and productivity at an all time high. Who cares if she ruled with an iron fist, terrified her employees like a military commander looking for errors, flaws, and dirt; regardless of how you feel about or felt about Leona Helmsley, her rise to the top of the business world was not met without the same fearlessness, determination, and ambition that she craved to be. For a while she was at the top, we watched how she went to prison where she was a model prisoner by all accounts. One can only imagine that if she paid the financial price of a meager 2 million dollars which is truly pocket money for her for the tax evasion. We could have avoided the mess in the courtrooms in New York City prosecuted by ambitious Rudy Giuliani. I think there are plenty of other crimes that go unpunished. There are millions of people who have not only lost their jobs at companies like Enron or Worldcom but have lost their pensions and savings as well. Leona Helmsley was never a Ken Lay or anybody else like her. She never fired people except for the sake of her obsessive compulsiveness and imperfection. if she was a man, she would have been called a genius. But that's always the way with successful women like Leona and Martha, Leona and Harry are finally together in peace at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Westchester and not at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York."},{"Title":"Queen of Mean, The","review":"unlike other unauthorized biographies, this book really convinced me that Leona is truly the queen of mean."},{"Title":"Gem Elixirs and Vibrational Healing Volume I","review":"As psychologist and flower essences therapist I occasionally turned to gem elixirs and other vibrational ways to cure.

Anyone who is a Trekkie will love this book."},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"This 1931 novel has long been one of my favorites among Wodehouse's many novels. It's a mix of farce and romantic comedy; whereas in much of Wodehouse's later work, the love plots seem almost perfunctory, here the romance between English Berry Conway and American Ann Moon (Wodehouse loved to work in trans-continental romances for his American readers) takes up much of the novel and is given a sweetness and warmth not always apparent in Wodehouse's funny, but sometimes slightly mechanical, post-WWII work. Of course, there's plenty of farcical action too, including many inspired sequences set in Wodehouse's &quot;Valley Fields&quot; (a thinly disguised version of the London suburb Dulwich). The hilarious chapter in which Lord Hoddesdon visits Valley Fields - and runs into a menacing fellow with an admiration for Stalin - is alone worth the price of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"I LOVE Wodehouse. I have this system where I try to read really thick \\"smart\\" books. You know, like the kind you bring up when you're trying to impress people with your intellectual prowess (\\"Oh yes, I completely agree. In fact, in the 'Metaphysics of Morals', Kant says basically the same thing, albeit more obtusely.\\") When my brains slither out through my ears in protest, that's when I know that it is time to put down the philosophy and pick up a Wodehouse. They're insanely funny and impossibly witty, and it gives me time to collect the pieces of my gray matter and shove them back in my head for another go at snooty intellectualism."},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"This one begins at the Drones Club, just like several of the Bertie Wooster stories, but these are not the Wooster characters. But with wonderful names like the Biscuit, Torquil, Kitchie, and Merwyn Flock, PGW does use some of his usual character types and plot lines: couples engaged to the wrong people, young men needing money. This is good vintage Wodehouse and a rather complex novel, not just a series of stories thrown together. And it was a lot of fun. But give me Bertie Wooster any day!"},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"P.G. Wodehouse is certainly one of the most gifted comic writers to have ever lived. Famous for his novels featuring Bertie Wooster and his inimitable valet, Jeeves, Wodehouse's other assorted novels are a vast treasure trove of manic fun and witty humor. \\"Big Money\\" is no exception to the rule, as complication after complication abounds, leaving the reader wondering how anything could ever be cleared up in the end.Berry Conway is in desperate need of money. His supposedly rich aunt has died, leaving him with a lot of worthless holdings but no cash. So he resorts to a job as secretary to T. Paterson Frisby who just happens to have a young American niece who needs chaperoning. Berry sets it up with his friend Lord Biskerton, aka the Biscuit, to have his Aunt Vera serve as chaperone with the hope that some money may come his friend's way, for the Biscuit (and his entire family) are in need of funds too. Trying to return the favor, the Biscuit suggests that Berry sell the worthless copper mine he has been stuck with to some mug who wouldn't know it wasn't worth a few hundred pounds. Little do either know that the mine, the Dream Come True, is actually worth money and that T. Paterson Frisby would do anything, even screwing over his own employee, to get that mine. And what no one accounts for is the fact that Frisby's niece, the beautiful Ann Moon, would find herself engaged to not only the Biscuit, but to his best friend Berry as well. After all, all is fair in love and war.\\"Big Money\\" is a fast paced, hilariously witty read. There are so many inane twists and turns within the plot that readers may wonder how things could ever be put right. The resolution is a wild, deluded night in the seemingly perfect London suburbs that leave the three young lovebirds in for a lot of surprises. While the reader knows that all will turn out well there seem to be some ends that need to be tied up that Wodehouse did not directly write. All in all, \\"Big Money\\" is classic Wodehouse. One must agree with the Hugh Laurie quote on the cover, that Wodehouse was the \\"funniest writer ever to put words on paper.\\""},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"As the book opens and our hero asks, 'Are you sure you want to hear the story of my life, Biscuit?' 'My dear chap, I'm agog...', you know you are in for a fast and hilarious ride. I am in agreement with other Wodehousians when they say a 4 star Wodehouse still walks on the backs of others; but this is pure 5 star. This book is light enough, gay enough, to let you leave everything behind and turn pages faster than a literary rabbit late for a luncheon date. Lord Biscuit is original, he is not Psmith or Bertie or Ukridge. I guess one could say that one has found a lesser known classic, don't you know; and if you are not a Wodehouse nut, reading this will give you Wode-cred with the die-hards. . ."},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"The recommended dose for many of Wodehouse's books is not more than once a year. The book, if the aforementioned cap is enforced, retains the juice for a longer time, somewhat similar to a half-chewed piece of gum regaining some flavor once kept aside for a few minutes.Big Money on the other hand seems to be a piece of Chicle that has an immense reservoir of spearmint (or your choice of toxic flavoring). I have read it, re-read it and then munched on it some more, multiple times a year, every year, without any appreciable loss of wit. This book is a gem, and along with other masterpieces like 'Joy in the Morning' the recommended dose can be safely exceeded, the only side-effect is an irritating, if not intolerable, pain in the sides from excessive mirth.If you have read Wodehouse before then be sure to get this, if you have not, then consider other books and then come back and buy this."},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"For me, reading P.G. Wodehouse usually is like opening the windows to my mind on a bright, crisp spring morning. Bertie or Psmith serve to sweep away the accumulated dust and doldrums and I put the book down refreshed and smiling. Perhaps I really have become a curmudgeon, perhaps there now is simply too much clutter in the attic of my mind, or perhaps BIG MONEY is not up to par for Wodehouse. Whichever, reading it did not work the usual charm. The novel is too much of a trifle, too much of a farce.In BIG MONEY, there are co-protagonists. One, Lord Biskerton (\\"Biscuit\\"), is the typical Wodehousian fop. The other, John Beresford Conway (\\"Berry\\"), is a conscientious young man of straitened means who works as private secretary for a rich old coot, named T. Paterson Frisby. During the course of the novel, Biscuit and Berry end up getting engaged to the same young woman (Frisby's niece) and they become entangled with Frisby and two shady henchmen in a battle for control of a copper mine in Arizona (the Dream Come True mine).The pace is brisk, the writing breezy. Wodehouse demonstrates once again that he is a champion spinner of similes: Sir Herbert \\"gazed at Berry as if he were an escape of sewer-gas\\"; \\"Mr Frisby made a noise extraordinarily like a sea-lion at the Zoo asking for fish\\"; \\"He stared at Berry with eyes like apprehensive poached eggs.\\" Indeed, it was the superior prose that carried me through the improbable twists and turns of the novel to its conclusion.If you are a confirmed addict of Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, you know what to expect from BIG MONEY, just don't expect him at his finest. If you are a newcomer to Wodehouse, in order to give him a fair shake you probably should first try something else (almost anything else)."},{"Title":"Big Money","review":"I enjoy all of P.G.

Overall, I have found this text to be very helpful as a supplement to lectures.I say this is a solid text primarily because of the glut of problems for you to practice on, and the nice flow of information through the chapters. The text is written with clarity in mind, and with clarity it does convey its topics. With well-placed worked sample problems and excellent charts and diagrams, this is a great book to have in hand if you're taking a college-level chemistry course.However, this book has its limitations in that there are several topics that are covered at the college level that are not really expounded on by the book. For example, the text gives a half-page introduction on semiconductors and how electron excitation works in semiconductors ; we did one full lecture on it. Furthermore, some of the problems that hit you in the form of the professor's custom-made, self-written problem sets occasionally involve problem solving methods that are not even covered in the book. I experienced a fair share of this when I saw application questions that involved a lot more variables than any of the book's questions involved.This brings me to talk about my last perceived limitation of the textbook: its lack of good application / integrative exercises. I like the book's armada of additional exercises at the end of the chapter, but I think a better textbook should include more application problems - sort of like 'problem-based learning', if that's a better way to put it. A good example would be the types of questions you can expect to see on a final exam - questions that implicitly expect you to apply all sorts of concepts obtained from the whole chapter, and possibly even concepts from previous chapters - to solve a real world problem.To conclude, the pros of this book include its clarity in explaining concepts, the decent flow from topic to topic, and its solid arsenal of practice problems and worked sample problems. The cons include its lack of application problems (problem-based learning), need for more in-depth discussions of some topics, and need for more problem solving strategies. Overall a great text, but a better text can bring my B up to an A in this class."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I used this book for Chemistry II (second semester General College Chemistry). Compared to my first semester text, this is the best text ever.College chemistry is designed to be difficult, the books shouldn't be. My 1st textbook talked and discussed as if we were Master's student's majoring in chemistry... not freshman.This text speaks generally in ENGLISH and not in Chemistry jargon like so many textbooks do.You won't get all the unneccessary information that many other texts have, and the author's seem like they actually want you to learn chemistry... not a common idea in chemistry texts or by professors.Of course, as with any college level text, a basic high school chemistry course is recommended before taking or reading this text...Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science, Ninth Edition","review":"I am currently taking an AP chemistry class, and we use this book. The class is meant to be extremely difficult, accelarated, and in-depth. We cover 22 out of the 25 chapters; we do not do modern materials, chemistry of the environment, or coordination compounds.I feel like this book tries to cover too much for a first year college course. For example, I think they go overboard with the organic and biochemistry, the metallurgy, and the molecular orbitals at the end of chapter 9.However, I think chapters like the one on electronic structure should take more time on the electrol configuration on transition metals and exceptions to Hund's rule and less time on the line spectra, the Bohr model, and the wave behavior of matter. The quantum mechanics, which I consider to be a very important part of electronic structure, is summarized in a table and barely explained.The best part of the book is that there are a ton of problems for practice.It is NOT a good book to use if you are trying to teach yourself college chemistry.
