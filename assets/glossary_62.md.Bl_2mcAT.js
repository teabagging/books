I have had it about 6 years now. The profound truths that exude from each page are truths that I must constantly be reminded of and that is why this book will always be at my fingertips. It helps to anchor me, center me, ground me and as one reviewer wrote here \\"align my thinking\\". Whether you buy used or new, it will become a well used book. I have an older hard cover edition.For those using this book for daily spiritual exercise, it may be helpful to have a Bible at hand as well. On certain days of the year, Fox, the author, instructs us to read a certain passage in the Bible and then the page for that day is a commentary on that Biblical passage. He doesn't do this for every day, but, there are some days that you will want to have your Bible close at hand as well.One reviewer here wrote that he starts each day by reading the page for the day in the morning. Certainly this a great way to use this book.Somehow, I got in the habit of reading it at night, when I go to bed at the end of the day.

I was clueless, and needless to say, lost. I had been interpreting everything I was reading in the Bible all wrong. Thank God for Emmet Fox. What I like about Fox is that he doesn't mince words. There's no fluff here. It's in your face and to the point. I need that. This was my first Fox book. I now own six and just ordered two more. One of my goals is to wholeheartedly feel, and peacefully dwell in, the Presence of God; another is to discover my True Place in life. I know it's all up to me (with God's help), but I never would have realized the Truth without the help of Emmet Fox.One word of advice concerning this book: Do not flip through, pick a day, and start reading. You must start at the beginning and read straight through.

What an amazing feeling to actually feel pampered in your own home as if someone else is taking care of everything for you but you're really the one doing it for yourself (with their help of course!) I discovered Leanne through Flylady and it has been one of the best things to ever happen to me. I've been on her menu mailer for awhile now which is also wonderful. It is much like the books she has out only delivered weekly to your inbox. I just adore it! This book however offers something really extra and different that can help you build family traditions and make holidays extra special. Instead of dreading planning the holiday meal (or worse going to Denny's!) I am finding myself looking forward to it now. Right now you can actually get the Thanksgiving menu from the book free off her website to try it out. Much of what is in the book is similar to that only with different holidays/occasions. It would never have even occurred to me to plan special meals for some of what she suggests. I am just so thrilled to have this resource. The main thing to know is that Leanne is for *real* people. The recipes are easy for you to understand and Leanne always explains things in full detail. The author of this book (and the others in the series) is also totally accessible to the public. Not only does she constantly ask for reader's opinions and suggestions but she USES them!! I have actually seen her incorporate new recipes and ideas after people suggested them. She also does a radio show now on World Talk Radio with Flylady (Marla). For the price the entire book series and menu mailer are worth every penny. Think about what you can pass on to your children about cooking and menu planning with this book and the others. For those who never learned to cook/menu plan she is a true friend. She is also a sincere person who shares herself with others. You can read more about her in another book she co wrote called Body Clutter to help people lose weight. I think she's terrific and I'm so excited to finally have this book! As you can tell I'm a big fan of both Leanne Ely (Dinner Diva) and Flylady (Marla Cilley). If you have not yet discovered these two then you are missing out. They have helped me more than prozac and therapy combined for getting my franny in gear!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner for the Holidays: Menus, Recipes, Shopping Lists, and Timelines for Spectacular, Stress-free Holidays and Family Celebrations","review":"I bought this book last year and used the Thanksgiving recipes. This was the first Thanksgiving I ever hosted at my house, and thanks to this book, it was a HUGE success. Not only does the book provide the grocery list and recipes, it also provides detailed discussions about various cooking techniques, organizational tips, and timelines to help you get your act together and keep it that way clear through until your event is over.The turkey we made using Leanne's recipe and treatment recommendations was OUTSTANDING, the best turkey I ever ate much less cooked.I highly recommend this book for domestically challenged OR beginner cooks/hostesses who wish to create beautiful celebrations with great food."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner for the Holidays: Menus, Recipes, Shopping Lists, and Timelines for Spectacular, Stress-free Holidays and Family Celebrations","review":"With all of the stresses the holiday season brings, it was nice having some help with the dinners that require a higher level of planning. At first I thought this was silly; \\"Who needs help with this sort of thing... Everyone knows how to do a basic dinner...\\" Well the inner child inside of me said to get it and give it a try anyway, no matter how silly I thought it was (at the time). Why did I not get this helper before? Now I feel silly for thinking so stinky. This book put a smile on my face and brain as I know I have a helper for many years to come with several holiday and other celebration type of meals. My menus with the recipes I needed were suggested to me. A timeline was something I have always needed. I have these now too (thank you!!!!!!) My grocery list was all ready made. I could tell everyone what we were having as well as the nutritional values for anyone who asked. This feature was fantasic. It helped show some of my loved ones that I care for thier wellness. With the help from this book, it freed up some valuble time. It kept me from getting stressed out over this sort of thing. A matter of fact I survived this year without getting really stressed out to much. Thanks Leanne!!!! This year my family was nice to me and I was nice to them as well.

Read it in one day. It is a very different book by J. Michener."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"I have long been a fan of Michener's, particularly the way he brings an area to life. I picked up Fires of Spring almost as an after-thought and was completely mesmerized. It really brought home the locale (I am from the area) and kept me thoroughly entertained throughout the entire book. I could visualize exactly the life and atmosphere even though I was born much later. My copy is much dog-eared as it is one of the few books interesting enough to hold my interest again and again."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"&quot;The Fires of Spring&quot; tells the story of a boy growing up in Pennsylvania in the early part of the century. An early Michener effort, it is a very moving and deep story about love, friendship, enemies and life in general. It's not Michener's usual, and will be an interesting comparative read for anyone familiar with his later work."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"One of the finest books ever written. I would like for all readers to know about this book, because this book has the kind of depth that readers long for and cannot find amid the formulaic installment writers of this era. What is amazing is how this novel remains so vibrant 50 plus years after its release. The human interest aspect is still so poignant. The cast of characters are among the most interesting ever created and Mr. Michener does such a great job of bringing the time and place alive that you can smell it. I can't see how this was never made into a movie. From the poorhouse where he was raised by his aunt that ran the place to the funhouse where he meets a tragic prostitute that he falls in love with, David's story is a wonderful odyssey. The scene where the indigent members of the of the poorhouse pool their pennies to buy David clothing remains one of the classic moments in literature. I wish that today's writers would pick this book up before they pick up a pen and learn how to create this kind of chemistry in their books rather than just applying their formula. The only knock I have on this book, is that it lured me to read other Michener works that I found boring and longwinded. But I treasure this novel and so will you.."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"This book was enjoyable to read. I was just reading it for an english assignment first, but I started to enjoy the book. I liked how Michener set up the whole story. Seeing what happened to David Harper was quite interesting. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes life stories because that's basically what this is about. I guess the thing i like the most is all the girls David goes through in the novel... all of them are different characters."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"In THE FIRES OF SPRING, published in 1949, James A. Michener relates the story of an orphan in America during the first thirty years of the twentieth century. Part autobiography, the late author avoids the Dickensian trap of the abusive orphanage and presents instead a group of interesting characters. Although THE FIRES OF SPRING is chock full of sexual relationships, it never sullies itself with page after page of graphic detail. The realism holds up even after almost a half century. My first fear was that having been written in the mid-1940s, THE FIRES OF SPRING would read stale at best, laughable at worst. But to my delight, the narration is fresh and the story entertaining. I have read most of Michener's work and stumbled across The Fires of Spring by accident recently. I'm glad I overcame my initial reluctance to tackle an &quot;older&quot; volume. I later read his book THE NOVEL, and found it to be vastly inferior in terms of plot development and organization. I recommend THE FIRES OF SPRING to anyone, Michener fan or not."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"Published in 1949 when Michener (who only began writing at age 40)was 42, \\"The Fires of Spring\\" is one of those epochal novels that all early writers seem compelled to write. It tells the story of David Harper (Michener, presumably)as he grows up in a Pennsylvania poorhouse, takes odd jobs as a teenager, goes to college and discovers literature and writing, and finally winds up as a struggling author in New York City. Along the way, he meets a wide variety of men and women who significantly help change his life. For those of you who are only familiar with Michener's later historical fiction epics, this book gives you a new awareness of Michener's earliest passions, his painful strivings and motivations as a young man, and his often lonely artistic aspirations and observations. Prepare to be deeply moved, surprised, and richly rewarded!"},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"I read this book over thirty years ago, then again this month for book club, and found my impressions had changed over the years. But, even though I cannot skim so easily over the occasional insensitive and backward way women are treated, I kept in mind that this work was completed in the 1940's, and found that, for the most part, it truly held up over all these many years. Very different from Michener's later works in style and magnitude, the tone and sense of place is equal to any of his later works, in my opinion, and more succinctly accomplished. For me, the relationships early on were what stood out the most, and made me reflect on the author's life, as it paralleled his own experiences so closely; an orphan boy growing up in Quaker country who yearned to see the world, was fascinated with mathematics, and eventually becomes a writer. All very like the author. Young David Harper's interactions with the old men of the poorhouse are gems you want to hold onto forever. Michener shows us that there is love and beauty to be found even in the least likely of places, and I look forward to reading this again in thirty years!"},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"Even though Michener wasn't exactly young when he wrote THE FIRES OF SPRING, he could remember very vividly what it had been like, and nowhere in all his succeeding work was he able to recapture the first ferment of youth as he did here. The book also takes us back to pre-war times, to the early part of the American century, the part that was stifled due to depression and national disunity.David is a great character and, like many of Dickens' heroes, he's born in an orphanage and raised in the poorhouse. Like 30s social realism, we discover that actually life raised communally isn't all that bad (see the kibbutz lifestyle promoted by Michener's contemporary, Leon Uris, in EXODUS) because of the parade of colorful characters, some nasty, mostly loveable, that people David's life with wisdom.And then when he reaches puberty, his body awakens, and between his legs burn the fires of spring! And here Michener brings us a gallery of different kinds of women with different attitudes towards the body and towards sexuality. In some places rather risque, even by today's standards, THE FIRES OF SPRING is an astonishing and heartrending book. One of Jim's best."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"I bought this simply because I recently moved to Bucks County. I don't especially care for Michener but I enjoyed this book very much. It shows for being a first published book, but none the less I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Fires of Spring","review":"My father turned me on to Michener many years ago. Although I'm not alone in finding some of his later novels tedious, \\"The Fires of Spring\\" is early Michener and completely different. I would love to have him sitting in front of me so I could ask him a ton of questions about it. I think it should be read more than once by readers and writers alike, perhaps at different stages in their lives. It will offer up new gifts and new discoveries each time."},{"Title":"Betsy's Busy Summer (Archway Paperback)","review":"I have and still thoroughly enjoy Betsy's Busy Summer.

Betsy is a beautiful little girl who wants everyone in the world to be happy ,including herself. Betsy, Billy, Star, and all of their friends are role models to all of us! I am 43 years old, and I had to study and analyze the Betsy books when I was in college majoring in psychology.

It is of an experimental design and follows APA format. Boys who were placed in disciplinary settings were compared with control groups in regard to the level of aggression that each demonstrated, after being purposely interrupted while performing a task of concentration. The measure of aggression was derived by the amount of electric shock that each (thought he) delivered to his antagonist. To reveal the outcome would be a spoiler.

I actually really enjoyed it. However, compared to other novels, like the \\"John Connor Chronicles\\", this one doesn't have as much fast paced action. Instead, it concentrates on the more scientific side of things, explaining the development of the time travel (Had to undertsnd if you don't have a degree in physics, but interesting nonetheless). We also learn a bit more about Cyberdyne's way of doing things.The author tells us about John and Sarah's new identities and lives, there are a few good terminators thrown into the mix and also an unaware innocent victim who doesn't quite know what is going on....It makes a good read, especially for the Terminator fan, so I recommend this largely to that market. It's a good book (although a bit on the short side, only 250 pages or so)but it helps to know the terminator storyline and the characters, otherwise it might get a bit confusing. Overall, can't complain, I give it 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Terminator 2: Hour of The Wolf","review":"I liked the Timothy Zahn terminator book, so I picked this one up.

He doesn't have any interest in keeping the family ranch, but he does not want the responsibility of making the rest of his siblings loose it, either. In the meantime, he strums his guitar, does a little carpentry, and counts the days. Then he meets single-mother Abby Graham.Men have frightened Abby's children ever since the night they saw their father commit murder. Abby is determined to protect them, whatever the cost, and hopes seeking refuge in Inferno will offer them anonymity. It has been over a year since Jessica spoke, and Abby no longer recalls what her voice sounds like. Meeting Luke sparks instant attraction, but Abby can't afford to tell Luke the truth of their identity or the reason they are on the run, because if the man who pursues them can find them, then all will be lost.Author Carla Cassidy pens a suspenseful romance in the second of The Delaney Heirs series. TO WED AND PROTECT strikes at the heart with its frightful account of the evil committed by a single man and the lives his actions transform. Abby's single minded determination to sacrifice everything to protect her children makes her a powerful heroine. Luke's growth from a good time loving, cowboy carpenter into something so much more will charm readers. A gripping, intelligent and well-crafted tale, TO WED AND PROTECT comes very highly recommended. ..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"This is a slender novel (novella lenght for me) that i enjoyed. The novel reads as a nonfiction real life memoir splashed with small flashbacks of Dostoevsky and his muse. Regardless of what i call it i found the writing above average, the story memorable and interesting and the character (there really is just one described and developed character and that is why the work feels more nonfiction then fiction, more personal then literary) three dimensional. This is an excellent example of how a character should come to life, breathe and change inside a story. If Ms. Vapnyar had expanded the story and develped at least one other character i would have given this novel 5 stars.I look forward to reading her previous book of collected stories and anything else she may write."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"I loved the story. The narcissistic character was written well. The light nuances of self-absorption and entitlement balanced with an elevating grandiosity of both himself and the main character as an extension of himself. You could feel her isolation close in on her as the book went along. The whole idea of \\"be careful what you wish for,\\" is in there. I only wish we would have had even more of a perspective on her boyfriend."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"This book was a disappointment. The main character was annoying and there was barely any plot. The main character Tanya even describes her own life as boring. Who wants to read about a boring life.

The story of a Russian immigrant searching for a purpose and direction for her life touched me deeply. References to dead Russian writers and their muses pulled past and present together. I deeply identified with the heroine's struggle to belong in a new culture. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"In \\"Memoirs of a Muse,\\" Vapnyar challenges us to step outside ourselves and see the American Dream through the eyes of Tanya, a bookish Russian Jew. Her dream is steeped in her peculiar background idealizing, and even fantasizing about, the classic Russian writers of the 19th Century, most notably Dostoevsky. One of the book's pleasures is Vapnyar's recreation of that time and her ability to get into the skin of Dostoevsky and his muse Polina Suslova. She deftly conveys the competing feelings in each character: Polina idolizes the great writer while she is disgusted by him; Dostoevsky treats Polina like a groupie but realizes her positive influence on his writing. Tanya follows in her footsteps a century later, eschewing the more materialistic inclinations of her relatives to seek greatness in becoming the muse to a great man. Her lack of familiarity with her new language and culture seal her fate. The book reads like a tragicomedy. In Tanya's story we see reflections of how our ideals of happiness are often based on illusions, and life's penchant for slapping us back to reality."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"Memoirs of a Muse is a kindhearted and bittersweet coming-of-age tale of a young Russian girl who suffers from a type of cultural and sexual dissonance. When we first meet her, Tanya Rumer is growing up in Soviet Russia, and as the great Empire comes apart, Tanya spends most of her youth tending to her feeble grandmother whilst her mother works to support them all.Tanya is an ordinary girl, an underachiever at school; she lacks the obvious conventional talents. Her initial disparateness, however, is tempered by a fierce imagination. As a girl, she's drawn to her grandmother's tales about her family's connection to the famous author Dostoevsky, and in her eyes he appears as a bright and sinister character, almost a fairy-tale villain.Tanya eventually forms a crush on an older teacher and hopes he will seduce her on a school camping trip. She begins to fantasize that he is like the dead old writers whose works she studies in class, Gogol, Chekhov - and of course Dostoevsky, the \\"graying hair, prominent foreheads, the knowing eyes,\\" and she begins to see herself as type a muse, \\"a companion to older artistic, literary men.\\" She needs a Prince who would save her from being a \\"potato-peeling Cinderella\\" and turn her \\"into a Princess/bad girl.\\"Tanya's fantasies prove to be somewhat prophetic, for she is granted an escape from Russia in the shape of a white envelope from the US Immigration. Now transplanted to New York, her life is suddenly distorted, leaving her facing an enigmatic future. Her world is turned upside down, as this very adventurous Russian is set wandering through a city of strangers with only her eccentric family for help.Tanya thinks she's escaped reality by leaving Russia, but in fact, she enters a worse reality, filled with humiliating jobs, separate bank accounts, prenup agreements and the smell of cooked salmon. Eventually she meets Mark Schneider, a selfish, snobbish and overly fussy B-grade writer. Blinded to Mark's faults, she begins to entertain the idea of being his muse - and buoyed by the diary she reads detailing Dostoevsky's affair with his mistress Polina - Tanya decides to move in with him.Wined and dined with everything paid for, Tanya soon realizes that Mark is nothing like her Russian literary idol. Fastidious to the point of frustration, she begins to realize he's a pale glimmer of what she first thought. She used to dream of the \\"old-bearded writer coming to her bed,\\" but Mark, with his paunchy stomach, graying hair on his chest, and the anxious eyes of a chubby little boy - couldn't be further from her fantasies.Author Lara Vapnyar beautifully recounts Tanya's unsullied dream of finding Mr. Right, a modern day Dostoevsky, but having to cope with dashed and unfulfilled hopes whilst doing so. Her journey is testament to the fact that dreams from time to time never turn out the way we want them to be. Tanya builds dream castle of Mark based on illusion and hope, then she gets to know him and the illusion crashes and the hopes go.Whilst Mark sees Tanya as a vulnerable foreigner, exotic, young and different, his initial attempt at intimacy, and the warm confessions, masquerade as a smooth, well-rehearsed performance. He never tries to be close to her; he just wants to listen and be admired. Tanya's altruism and the need for her to be loved is swamped Mark's smugness, especially his conviction that people are there to serve only him.A charming exploration of sex, intimacy and feminine intuition, Memoirs of a Muse captures the heart of what it means to be a woman, who is awakening sexually and emotionally. Tanya's whole life prior to meeting Mark, was series of predetermined and interconnected steps all leading her to becoming a writer's muse.As she reads about the young Polina, Tanya is gradually transformed and filled with a cavernous, impalpable yearning. Unfortunately, her subsequent search for this connection doesn't really quell her longing. Tanya learns the hard lesson - while geniuses create art through struggling and suffering, ordinary people are habitually consumed by it and are often left with the remnants, to feed off the geniuses troubled mind.

The young Tanya is fascinated by the portrait of Dosstoyevsky. She spends her time reading about him and is especially fascinated by his stormy relationship with the charismatic yet difficult Polina Suslova Dostoyevsky's mistress. When Polina ends their relatioinship Dostoyevsky marries an unpreposssing girl, Anna Grigorievna, 24 years his junior. Anna is placid of temperament, tending to the needs of the great writer. Young Tanya decides it is her destiny to be the muse of a great man, to be the spark that ignites his great female characters as Polina did for Dostoyevsky.Tanya is an attractive but otherwise unremarkable student who receives her college degree in history writing on such topics as the history of Russian makeup, and breakfast in ancient Rome. After having graduated she receives an opportunity to go to New York to live with her aunt and uncle, poor emigres trying to make lives for themselves and fit into the alien American culture. Finally her chance to be a muse comes when she meets Mark, a published writer at a reading in an upper West Side bookstore.The much older Mark is a classic narcissist. He has little interest in Tanya's thoughts, memories even her sexual pleasure. She spends her days tending to his needs, waiting to inspire Mark to begin a new novel. In the process she abandons a career or even just a job and is being 'kept' by Mark as her professor mother reminds her during phone calls to Moscow. But as the years go on Tanya begins to suspect that something is wrong with their relationship. When Mark begins to write a new novel, and Tanya discovers in a biography of Dostoyevsky Mark's real thoughts about her, her belief in the importance of being a muse begins to unravel.Although the progress of the relationship with Mark is predictable the juxtaposition of the relationship between Dostoyevsky and Polina, Dostoyevsky and Anna and Tanya's own life makes for an engrossing story. Along the way Vapnyar provides insights into the difficulties of the immigrant experience and what it means to lose one's sense of self in another. This is Vapnyar's first novel. She is a fine writer to be watched."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"Vapnyar is one of those writers who is able to write in a way that transports readers to the scene - I felt, I smelled, I heard, I giggled... I couldn't put the book down.This is a story of a Russian girl with a rich imagination and a longing for a life that is lived \\"to the utmost degree!\\". \\"But now I was fifteen, and that long-anticipated extraordinary talent still hadn't emerged. My many gifts rattled about like cheap jewelry in a sequined bag - there wasn't a single gemstone. Now what kind of fulfilling life could the likes of me lead?\\" Her language is honest and sincere (with ought being rude or shocking) and puts the story on a very intimate and familiar level."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"============Ms. Vapnyar constructs lovely sentences of well-chosen words. The main story is juxtaposed with a fabricated diary of Dostoevsky's mistress, whom the heroine, Tanya, of \\"Memoirs\\" admires. The entire book is set in Simoncini Garamond, but a second typeface would have served well to delineate between Tanya's writing and the 19th Century diaries of Polina. (This book was published by Mark Z. Danielewski's house, Pantheon Books. They *know* about typeface changes!)\\"Memoirs\\" would have been an excellent piece of short fiction, but it's been padded at the beginning with 88 pages of narrative about the female protagonist's childhood which does nothing for the story.

The second half of the book is much better than the first 88 pages."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"\\"If I'm asked to name my proudest attainment, I will say:I have slept with Hank Rearden. I had earned it.\\"Dagny Taggart in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" by Ayn RandThe primary goal of a modern feminism, post suffragist movement, is to overthrow a notion that a woman's worth is determined by a man she can get. Only a true fourth wave man-hating dyke on the margins of a womankind would subscribe to this idea. The rest of the best of us are looking for a man that will validate our ostentatious views of ourselves. But there is a fine line between earning a worthy man to share your body with and pursuing a man through whom one can justify its own existence.The book \\"Memoirs of a Muse\\" by Lara Vapnyar is written in simple, yet elegant prose, simultaneously funny, sad and intelligent. It is a story of a young woman, Tanya, whose only aspiration in life is to become a muse for a reputable writer. She equates herself with Dostoyevsky's lover Appolinaria Suslova, a prototype for a number of women in Dostoyevsky's masterpieces, who neither achieved happiness in her own life, nor brought it to the great Russian writer. Tanya succeeds in finding a suitable man (Mark), considerably older than her, who had published a number of critically acclaimed novels. She moves into Mark's flat, providing him with sex and household chores, and keeping a diary of his daily activities, while he embarks on writing a new novel.Tanya doesn't physically love Mark, she has to fake orgasms (whether Mark is not adept enough, or she is utterly repulsed by him); the only thing that keeps her from leaving Mark is a dream of forever associating her name with a famous writer. Who would remember Appolinaria Suslova without Dostoyevsky?As the time passes by, Tanya starts realizing that in her quest of becoming a Muse, and therefore, endorsing her feelings of self-importance, she settled for being a care-taker, not a very flattering role; and not only she doesn't love Mark, but is not loved in return. He is nothing more than a repository of her hopes and dreams; she finds it hard to abandon her mission when she invested so heavily into it.In the end, the heroine chooses a direction different from Appolinaria's, since a life with a decent man without great literary gifts is simpler, yet happier than with a talented, but egotistic and self-absorbed man.Tanya's marriage to an engineer functions as a happy end, if one omits an interesting detail: toward the end of the book, in order for our heroine to extricate herself from a position of Mark's concierge, she reads his newly finished book and finds it thoroughly lacking. That gives Tanya strength to leave. Would she have found enough resolve to leave him had he written a masterpiece? Appolinaria's downfall was becoming a mistress of Dostoevsky, the great writer, and not of some obscure 19th century one that nobody remembers or reads. The book is not a treatise on how to find happiness, but a tribute to a genius. (This is a very forced conclusion; the author would most likely disagree).Appolinaria carried on her bleak affair with Dostoevsky, a married and emotionally detached man, who never satisfied her physically, \\"for he touched her perfect body with his mind\\".

That is just what Tatiana (Tanya) Rumer does in this very readable, comic and original novel. The problem is that Tanya craves to become a bad girl muse rather a good girl one. Her model is Apollinaria (Polina) Suslova, Fedor Dostoevsky's muse. She vows to become like Polina and never like the \\"devoted, calm, domesticated\\" Anna Grigorievna, Dostoevsky's wife.Unfortunately for Tanya, things do not go as planned with her writer, but there is a wonderful suprise ending for her ambition. This is a charming story with a twist of Russian irony."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Muse: A Novel","review":"Growing up in Russia before the collapse, Tanya discovered Dostoyevsky and more significant the great writer's muse. Moving with her mom the professor to Brighton beach Brooklyn, Tanya concluded that Dostoyevsky's muse was his mistress Polina, who became part of The Brothers Karamazov and The Idiot; the second wife Anna was a secretary stenographer, but obviously no inspiration. Tanya decides her goal in life is to be the motivation to a great novelist.She meets writer Mark Schneider at a book gala and decides he is the one. They have an affair, but as she notes in her \\"Memoirs of a Muse\\" he seems more preoccupied with physically working out, sex, and partying than in writing. Tanya's begins to reconsider whether she selected the wrong author or perhaps her role as she studies further the influence of Dostoyevsky's muse.This is a terrific character study told mostly by Tanya with an intermingling look at Dostoyevsky's life. Tanya is a delight from her deep understanding about cosmetics in tsarist Russia to her belief that she is somebody's muse. Part amusing satire and part a serious look at roles in interrelationships, fans who enjoy a well written refreshingly unique tale, will want to read MEMOIRS OF A MUSE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rumi's Divan of Shems of Tabriz: Selected Odes (Element Classics of World Spirituality)","review":"The below review says it all realy. James Cowan writes with a real love of the subject and brings to life the emotions, the landscape the events behind the meeting of Rumi and Shems. Unlike others he does not hide the fact that this is a rewrite fo earlier translations and it is perhaps his humility that realy makes this book special.If you want to read the works of Rumi it might be worth starting here (the works of Professor Schimmel will also be of help)"},{"Title":"Rumi's Divan of Shems of Tabriz: Selected Odes (Element Classics of World Spirituality)","review":"A fried gave this book to me as a gift, knowing my interest in Mowlana Rumi's poems.I usually don't bother with English interpretations/translations of Mowlana's work. I had perused Arberry's and had to put it down in disgust over his superficial attempt to co-opt this man into the religious realm. Arberry's influence being what it was, and as it remains, it is a real disservice to those scholars who can't read Persian well enough to appreciate Mowlana first hand.This book goes even further. Not only the interpretations are not close, most the word plays and double entendre are lost, the author moves verses and above all, he adds verses where there are none! I consider this a misguided presentation of the few poems he has selected. After reading a few, I decided to check them against the originals. This is what I found.Gazal number 2045, (Cowan's 37) has a final verse about Shams which doesn't exist. Its crudeness prompted to check my two copies of the divan and the version on ganjoor.org. None have this weird verse.Samething with Gazal number 2395 (Cowan's 41). No final verse, noting about Shams (Sun) as he has glibly made up.I have shut the book. It is a disgrace. I looked at three poems, two of them have been appended with the interpreters own imagination.The question is motivation. Why are these translators presenting Mowlana's work like that of mindless \\"new age\\" person? To anyone who understands Persian, these are works of inquiry into psychology and perception using ones own experiences as the singular source. So what is the reason behind all the \\"spiritualism\\" painted on Mowlana by western scholars, and I use that word in its loosest sense.A. J. Arberry's interpretations were over the top in religiosity and mindless spiritualism. Cowan's attempts seems to be to further such denigration by pretending that the poems are about earthly love.In my reading, of tes of times per poem, his poem are neither religious, nor spiritual or ecstatic. A direct reading of this man's work shows a very clear headed man of exquisite sensitivity questioning every feeling he perceives and every inspiration that surprises him, the incongruity of his feeling and anything that people assume to be external to it, he is wondering about his source of inspiration, not outside, but in his own brain, as he very clearly says in several of his poems, that it is all in his brain. He doesn't even use the word mind, but he clearly says brain, they physical thing in his skull.I would not recommend either of the translations/interpretations mentioned here. I have no idea where one can find a clearheaded one. I pity scholars, students and poetry lovers who need an accessible translation/interpretation. This man's work was centuries ahead of itself, he is delving into and analyzing his creativity and perception in ways that hard neuroscience is just getting to do.There is much that can be learned from Mowlana in terms of the relationship between an artists creative unconscious and his conscious, lost self. These translations are full of sugar and no substance. If you want to enjoy it the level of a Madona song, well, then maybe they work."},{"Title":"ULTRASONOGRAPHY OF THE EYE AND ORBIT","review":"They finally came out with a 2nd edition!! These pioneers in the field have again written the most authoritative and complete description of the physics, practice and latest technology in the field of ophthalmic ultrasound.These recognized leaders in Ophthalmic Ultrasound have updated their original masterwork in an elegant volume that covers the entire spectrum of ophthalmic ultrasound including the history, physics, application and pathology of ocular diagnosis. It is exceptionally well written and exceedingly readable for technician to experienced ophthalmologist!The material is presented with amazing color images and loaded with the highest resolution of the anterior segment and retina. It includes conventional 10 MHz to the newest cutting edge, very high frequency Artemis Arc scans of the anterior segment. Biometry as well as diagnostic techniques are described by acknowledged leaders in the field.Included is a DVD with an introduction by the legendary Walter Cronkite and a dozen or so of some of the very best vitreoretinal specialists in the world describing ocular pathologies- including vitreous hemorrhage, ocular tumors, and retinal detachments.An enlightening, extremely well written read and an amazing resource...my highest recommendation!! Thank you Drs. Coleman, Silverman, Lizzi et al.!!"},{"Title":"ULTRASONOGRAPHY OF THE EYE AND ORBIT","review":"Arch Ophthalmol. 2007;125:437-438.Early in its development, ophthalmic ultrasound split into two major camps: one led by Dr Coleman and the other by Karl Ossoinig, MD. Both men had distinct opinions regarding the optimal techniques for examination, and their spirited interchanges added spice to ophthalmology meetings and journals. When Dr Coleman published the first edition of Ultrasonography of the Eye and Orbit in 1977, it became the major reference for the field. Almost 30 years later, this second edition highlights the advances and current status of this field as seen through the eyes of one of its pioneers. The authors have extensive experience in the design and use of ophthalmic ultrasound instrumentation. They clearly explain the fundamental physics of ultrasound in layperson's as well as in more precise mathematical terms. They highlight the advantages and limitations of different scanning modalities, such as sector, linear, and arc scans, and discuss the factors that determine the quality of B-scan images. Dr Coleman, despite his passion for his own methods, also provides an objective analysis of his and Dr Ossoinig's methods.The chapters on ocular and orbital diagnosis detail the conditions in which ultrasound has diagnostic utility. The figures are of high quality, and the accompanying legends and text are clear and concise. While Ultrasound of the Eye and Orbit, 2nd Edition, written by Sandra Frazier Byrne, RDMS, and Ronald L. Green, MD, contains examples of more disease conditions, Dr Coleman's text includes more images taken with new or novel imaging systems. Recently, the availability of higher frequencies and digital signal processing has improved ultrasound resolution substantially. The authors have played a significant role in these advances, and the sheer beauty of some of these images is in itself reason enough to own this book.Advances in computer processing have opened new avenues for ultrasound diagnostic techniques. This book describes 3-dimensional ultrasound imaging and discusses its utility for monitoring choroidal melanoma following eye-sparing therapies. The authors describe their decades of work using computer-assisted analysis of raw radio-frequency data to assess the malignant potential of choroidal melanoma. A uniquely detailed chapter about arc scanning with high-frequency evaluation of the anterior segment provides a good basis to understand the benefits of the Artemis 2 (Ultralink LLC, St Petersburg, Fla), a 50-MHz, 3-dimensional arc B-scan unit, for use in refractive surgery.One significant drawback to previous books on ophthalmic ultrasound has been their inability to demonstrate the kinetic findings of an ophthalmic examination within the printed medium. This book is accompanied by a DVD that demonstrates the basic kinetic findings of conditions, such as retinal detachments and vitreous hemorrhage, using narrated video clips. The authors include videos of typical patient examinations from start to finish using their techniques and instrumentation. The video of an examination using the Artemis 2 is especially well done. I would like to see even more narrated video clips to demonstrate how the findings of a dynamic ultrasound examination can help in diagnosis. The DVD format would also be ideal for showcasing 3-dimensional ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation.This compact book manages to squeeze twice the information into half the number of pages as the first edition. I would recommend this text for ophthalmologists and technicians who have an interest in understanding ophthalmic ultrasound, or to anyone who desires proficiency in ultrasound examination techniques."},{"Title":"My musical life;","review":"In this book, Rimsky-Korsakov gives the inside story of his life and those of his fellow musicians.

Then I tried again to read it several months ago and just could not get past the prose; however, when I went back to find specific examples of sentence fragments and awkward prose, I did not find them. When I really studied each line, it made sense and did not seem so awkward. I ended up setting the book aside and read something else that did not require as much effort ... like David Copperfield. Personally, I think that that alone speaks volumes about this work.I have now read this story out of sheer determination. Slowing my reading pace to be able to absorb each sentence, I find many of the descriptions quite vivid and beautiful though I still resent the awkwardness of the prose and the fragmented and spliced sentences (which I did find this time around). For example of a common type of splice, \\"Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very hospitable and festive - not to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep of the road he declared.\\" Fragments and long lists of items are common in descriptions: \\"A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned up earth by the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity.\\" In one of the beginning scenes he describes two women, one fat and one thin, but when he comes back to them they are the old one and the young one. Then towards the end one of them is described as the one with the cat. An example of what I would call awkward prose is: [In reference to the statement that women live in a world all of their own making unfettered by reality]. \\"Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.\\"I was really disappointed with what I got for the effort with this story. There is not terribly much story. Marlowe recounts the story of his trip up the near virgin Congo to retrieve Mr. Kurtz, an agent in the trading company who is surrounded by mystery for both those that merely hear of his exploits and those who live around him. Meeting Kurtz and determining the status of his mental condition is the crux and climax of the story. That really is about it. The whole drama to the book is to be drawn by the contrast of \\"civilized\\" and \\"primeval\\" and a study of the characters. This may be okay in a classroom where many people can collectively infer traits from the characters after several hours of discussion but is too abstract for my tastes in pleasure reading."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I know that scholars are going to disagree with me but Conrad's narrative alternates between exasperatingly long stories of inconsequential matters and skimming over consequential matters.

Kurtz himself is just a tiny part of the narrative. We really dont learn about the inner Kurtz. More time is spent with his grieving fiance than is spent with him. \\" The horror, the horror\\" , has for some reason become a famous line in literature , much like, \\" We'll always have Paris, has become in the cinema.I read this book in college, years ago and thought it was boring at that time. I ordered it for my Kindle, thinking the mature me would appreciate the book but I was still disappointed.Some of the description is excellent and it is a good look at colonial Africa at the time, so the book was not a total loss but a disappointment nevertheless.It reads very much like a novel translated from another language into English.

One of his powerful tools throughout the novella is the imagery, which Conrad uses to illustrate, contrast, and compare ideas for the reader to visualize. We can recognize that the first imagery of darkness emerges from the title of the novella. As we read through the story, we encounter the repetition of light and most importantly the repetition of darkness. The imagery of light and darkness represents beyond the contrast of the colors. It illustrates white (the Europeans) and black (the Africans). Furthermore, it illustrates European colonization versus uncivilized African, righteousness versus inhuman act, and life versus death.The imagery of light and darkness appears in numerous parts of the novella. Some of the examples, Marlow -he is a main character in the novella- discusses about a blank space on the map as \\"a white patch,\\" but it had changed into \\"a place of darkness\\" (Conrad 5). Fresleven -he is one of the characters in the novella- was killed because of the misunderstanding of \\"two black hens\\" (6). Marlow arrives at a city, which reminds him of a \\"white sepulcher.\\" Two women are \\"knitting black wool.\\" Marlow sees a \\"white-haired\\" secretary (7). Marlow describes the two women as they were guarding the \\"door of darkness\\" (8). Marlow sees the color of \\"dark-green\\" almost \\"black\\" of the edge of the jungle (10). Marlow sees \\"black rags\\" around the Africans' loins (12). \\"We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness\\" (31). They come upon a \\"dark corner\\" at the Inner Station (33). As Marlow goes to see Kurt's intended, the room appears to \\"have grown darker, as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead\\" (69). Marlow sees \\"an unearthly glow in the darkness\\" in Kurt's intended, which reflects her grief and sorrow (70). Marlow is unable to tell Kurt's intended the truth about Kurt's last word as Marlow describes, as \\"it would have been too dark -too dark altogether\\" (72). These are some examples of Conrad's illustration of light and darkness that keep repeating throughout the novella. However, the imagery of light and darkness is signified in several meanings according to the plot of the story and the reader's view.The imagery of light and darkness can be depicted in several intensions. The imagery of light can be represented as white Europeans whose intention is to civilize the African's way of living. In contrast, the imagery of darkness can be represented as the uncivilized Africans. The second intension of light can be depicted as the European imperialism carried out by Kurtz -he is one of the main characters chosen to live among the Africans as the chief or a figurehead- over the Africans' tribe. It seems that Kurt's first intension acquired by his company is to bring light (civilization) into the lives of the Africans and also bring as much ivory as possible into the European company. Subsequently, we find that parts of Kurt's intension had change. His interest on ivory might have been the same or similar to the past but his interest in Africans' lives has changed. He is represented as the light for the Africans while the ivory is represented as darkness. The concept of African civilization by the European company becomes the darkness and the Africans' wild life becomes the light in the heart of darkness.The imagery of light and darkness is arbitrary in the novella. What is considered to be righteousness according to the Europeans is indeed inhuman. One way is to think of light as bringing the civilization to the Africans, but this can also mean bringing the darkness into the African's lives by chaining them up and making them work as slaves. \\"The joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking\\" (13). The European imperialism is represented as the darkness and inhuman act. They go to Africa just because they want \\"to make money\\" (17). Europeans make money by collecting ivory and taking advantages of the Africans' land and also the Africans' lives. The image of European trading company as being white and righteousness is an illusion, instead, it is so dark and evil; as a result, many lives are being taken away.The image of death is signified as darkness. The death of Fresleven signifies as the darkness in Africa and how brutal Africans are (6). The image of Africans being chained up is also signifies as the living death, the darkness; they are being controlled by white men and not being able to run freely (13). The death of a \\"middle aged Negro with a bullet hold in the forehead\\" is also signified as inhuman killing (17). This is a form of darkness from the European side. Lastly, it is the death of Kurtz, which signifies as the darkness from the European side and as well as the African side. Perhaps, Kurtz is the only one who can bring light into the lives of the Africans but since he is dead, the light is also vanished along with him leaving the darkness behind the Africans and also his intended who lives in Europe.The imagery of light and darkness in the novella can be describes in many meanings. What we evaluate as the righteousness might consider as the darkness and inhuman act. Joseph Conrad is an outstanding English writer. He uses the imagery to illustrate and contrast opposite ideas such as light versus darkness, righteousness versus inhuman, and life versus death. What is interesting is that he does not suggest that one idea must be in the category of light or darkness, but instead he makes the reader chooses what is considered as light or darkness.Conrad, Joseph.

Kurtz has some how made himself into a god in the eyes of the natives. Marlowe retrieves this man and begins his journey back listening to the strange talk of Kurtz. This book takes some effort to read and is not all that interesting. Conrad does point out some interesting things the insides of the human mind.

What it is, however, is an abosorbing story that deals with the infamous existentialist idea of &quot;authenticity&quot; in one's approach to life.The book has sundry mesmerizing lines which describe how the main character feels as though he is being swallowed up by the savage jungle while on his mission to find Kurtz. It also fulfills one of the most remarkable journey to the underworld motifs of any hero's adventure that I have ever read. Those who subscribe to Jungian literary criticism as well as the ideas of Joseph Campbell (one of Jung's disciples) will come to crave this novel (as I did). Speaking of Campbell, the &quot;threshold&quot; of the trek is also quite memorable as well.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a novel that captures the pulse of the major themes that were being expounded in early 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I have reread this book several times. Cannot get enough of it. It takes you to another place and time but has many life lessons for today's world."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad wrote this classic novella on the \\"clash of civilizations\\"; or, much more appropriately, a clash of non-civilizations more than 110 years ago. It was based on Conrad's brief experience working in the then Belgian Congo. There is at least partial validity to comparative studies on the respective merits and de-merits of the various colonial powers, and in most cases Belgian rule has ranked near the bottom, reflected by a brutal rule dedicated solely to enriching the ruling power, with virtually no benefit to the native people. This book could only help reinforce that assessment.English was Conrad's third language, yet he mastered it better than virtually all native-English speakers. His prose is rich and dense. Along with Melville, his depictions of the sea in its varying conditions are evocative, and his novelTyphoon and Other Tales (Oxford World's Classics)is a classic to the awesome power of the ocean. In this novella, there are strong descriptive passages of the river when the boat is anchored in the Thames estuary, and Marlow tells the tale of his encounter with Kurtz, along with his brief stint in the Congo, in the style of a flashback.The \\"heart\\" of the book, as it were, is the interactions between two extremely different cultures, and the exploitation of one by the other. It is the late 19th Century, London is the capital of the largest empire the world has ever known, yet Conrad makes the point that a mere 2,000 years or so earlier, if a Roman trireme had ventured up the Thames, it would have been going into \\"the heart of darkness,\\" on the very outer edges of its empire, in similar circumstances to one venturing up the Congo River today.In Marlow's flashback tale, there are passages which are deeply empathetic to the natives bearing the \\"burden of white men,\\" and there are other passages that are certainly racist by today's standard, so one or the other could be cited to prove a thesis. There is a dramatic buildup to Marlow's meeting with Kurtz, with immense praise for the most effective agent of the company tempered with hints of certain irregularities, as though he might have been out in \\"the bush\\" too long, and \\"gone native.\\" It turns out that he was a demi-god within the company, providing far more ivory through his unorthodox methods than other agents, but to the natives he had become a god, in part, because he adopted their ways. It is very much a tale of power, and its corrupting influences. This book was adapted as a metaphor for the Vietnam War, and starred Marlon Brando as Kurtz, inApocalypse Now: Reduxa movie I truly detested since I felt it had distorted the essence of the American involvement in Vietnam. Don't know if it has been adapted as a metaphor for the corporate world, but I could imagine it ringing truer there.There is a poignant scene at the end, in which Marlow must try to convey the circumstances of Kurtz's demise to his fianc&eacute;. And reminiscent of Paul inErich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations), when confronted with a similar task, the only proper solution is to lie.Brilliant prose, rich in insights on the human condition, this novella, particularly on the second read, retains its appropriate designation as a 5-star classic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I recently re-read the Joseph Conrad novella Heart of Darkness, a perennial classic and the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola'sApocalypse Now. Having first read this powerful piece in high school, there was much I had forgotten. I am glad to have revisited it. This time it really hit home: just how relative its themes of greed, corruption, and redemption are in today's world. We may draw a comparison to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the world's hunger for oil and its consequences, or even to the megalomania we've seen recently that has been the ruin of US and other market economies.Conrad's story takes place in 19th century colonial Africa; a virtual free-for-all for holding companies and the like scrambling to lay claims on precious minerals (gold, silver) and other natural resources (ivory, slaves) in its vast untapped interior. The problem for these greed machines was finding personnel willing or ignorant enough to brave the \\"darkness\\": wild animals, disease, uncivilized tribal societies (some cannibalistic). Kurtz was one such individual who travels downriver into the thicket to set up a station for his employers, but experiences a taste of totemic worship, he being the totem. His sad tale is told by Marlow, a \\"seaman\\" and a \\"wanderer\\" who was employed by the same administrative company as Kurtz.\\"...their administration,\\" says Marlow \\"was merely a squeeze and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors and for that you want only brute force -- nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others.\\"Marlow relates his experiences on the vast interior river (Congo?) which culminate in his search, along with the company manager and a native crew, for the elusive Kurtz who had terminated communication with the civilized world months before. After finally finding an ailing Kurtz downriver, Marlow's own obsession with just listening to this fellow comes to fruition in a haze of disenchantment. Delusion and dementia, along with his adoring natives, have claimed him, But Marlow, at the urging of the manager, must retrieve Kurtz (and his ivory) to the company's outpost. It is on the way back, after a reckless escape, that Kurtz will utter those infamous and harrowing last words: \\"The horror, the horror.\\"For me Kurtz represents the iconic Soldier led into the great Darkness of some war (Iraq) or material venture (oil) perpetrated by the \\"conquerors\\" (guess who). In this analogy, Kurtz's ultimate madness relates to the current epidemic of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) we see in our troops returning from the war zones.Unfortunately Kurtz's \\"horror\\" is being experienced, in some manner, by thousands of Iraq and Afghanistan vets today. These are just disillusioned kids returning home to their families without jobs, without limbs, without peace of mind; with nightmares. So who is Marlow, in this tale? Is he us?In Heart of Darkness Marlow finally must face Kurtz's grieving fiancee back in London. She entreats him to assure her of Kurtz's final moments, since he was, must have been, her loved one's friend.\\"Your were with him -- to the last?\\" she asks.\\"'To the very end,' I said, shakily. 'I heard his very last words...' I stopped in a fright.\\"'Repeat them,' she murmured in a heart-broken tone. 'I want --I want -- something -- something -- to -- to live with.'Marlow is suddenly faced with a dilemma. And so are we. Will we lie as Marlow does or will we face the ugly truth?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Somehow it seems to be a presumptous undertaking to write a review of such a monumental work. The narrative is short. The writer, Marlow, is sent to the inner Congo to find a Mr. Kurtz, a legendary hunter of ivory, and to bring him back or take up his position.The atmosphere grows increasingly oppressive, from the start in Belgium, where something seems to have been left unsaid, to the long trip up the Congo, through places of heartbreaking emptiness, emptiness of the soul.Finally the meeting with the famed Kurtz, which does not really bring spiritual relief, because Kurtz now is neither the expected demon nor the misunderstood philanthropist. He simply is a broken man. And his notes, read by Marlow, highlight the ambiguity of his and our characters. And that is why Marlow cannot get over this experience. He knows that deep within himself there is also a Kurtz lurking."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Every time I read this I am always amazed at how much has been accomplished in so short a span of pages. And the effect of this work does not diminish with repeat readings. So if you have already read this and most people have read it again. I gaurantee you won't regret it. This is probably the most perfectly executed work of Conrads career and that is saying a lot. Very few authors wrote a greater number of works that remain classics and relevant than he. The primitive world has a voice in this book as do colonial administrators and we even get to hear from that one who has gone off the edge of the map of humanity and into his own realm of darkness but the voice dominating this book is Marlowes'. He tells the tale aboard a ship in safe harbor in the London docks but his voice takes you on quite a journey. From the very first scene described in the administration offices with strange black clad women figures sewing we know this is going to be like no tale we have heard before. The work as a whole is so perfect it makes one think of music as the only comparison. Still no other tale like it exists. If you haven't picked this one up in a while do so and listen to Marlowe tell it once again. Listen to the music and feel the power of the primitive pulse through you as you journey toward the heart of an immense darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's Heart of Darkness is a brilliant, disturbing work which, like most of Conrad's fiction, is drawn heavily from his own life. Conrad served as a ship captain on the Congo River, succeeding a captain who was brutally slain by local savages, and the fictional account of Marlow's trip into the African jungle very much mirrors his own true life adventure. Conrad's time in Africa affected him deeply, as he nearly died from disease and felt the effects of his time in Africa, both physically and psychologically, for the rest of his life.The book works on many levels. First, it is a concise, suspenseful adventure story about Marlow's search for Kurtz, an ivory trader and member of a colonial trading company that has gone into the jungle and apparently been corrupted by his power. Psychologically, the novel explores mankind's infinite capacity for evil and corruption, when unleashed from the bounds of law and civilization. Potlitically, the book is a scathing indictment of European colonialism, and the savagery with which a supposed &quot;civilized&quot; nation such as England or Belgium, at least in the nineteenth century, could and would plunder locals for the almighty lucre. If there was any lingering doubt as to Kurtz's sanity when Marlow finally reached him, the impaled heads greeting visitors to the camp stand as a stark reminder of the depths to which he has fallen in his effort to &quot;kill all the brutes.&quot; I thought Marlow's benign condescension towards Kurtz' wife, at the end, was a fitting and memorable end to the saga.Heart of Darkness, while relatively short, is not a quick read. Conrad's language is so concentrated, his style so calculated, there are simply no wasted words or throwaway scenes. It is truly remarkable that someone like Conrad, for whom English was not a first (or even second) language, could craft novels such as Heart of Darkness, Nostromo, and The Secret Agent. If you have not read this book since it was forced upon you in school, or if you are curious to reaquaint yourself with it after seeing Coppola's brilliant adaption in Apocalypse Now, you owe it to yourself to pick this up and give it your attention. It is an enduring classic, one of the first really modern novels."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad is a story that connects the audience to the narrator's senses most perfectly. We come to understand the environment, the setting, the other characters and Kurtz strictly from the narrator's first-person point-of-view, as he experiences things.We are not able to see how the world views him. Is he seen as superior, a drone, a sailor? His dreamlike consciousness navigates us, the readers, down the river as if we are a part of the flow of things, ripples in the water, patches of the darkness.Conrad uses language to paint images in our minds. He poignantly uses metaphors such as, &quot;In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighborhood&quot; to animate those images and allow them to breathe a bit.His choice of words and word combinations, his poetic tone, his elegant style and smooth transitions craft a superbly sensual experience. He is, on the surface, talking about the exploration of man in Africa with all of its physical and moral dilemmas, and yet the underbelly is the interior of man, an endeavor to touch the reader at his core. &quot;Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things, a center for trade of course, but also for humanizing, improving, instructing.&quot; When Conrad says that the &quot;germs of empires&quot; floated into man's head, &quot;ebbing down the river into the mystery of an unknown earth,&quot; his metaphors appeal emotionally to something deeply serious; a commentary on the heart of man.Our senses are assaulted with tastes and surfaces, sounds and images. The &quot;tremor of far-off drums,&quot; the &quot;silence driven away by the stamping of our feet,&quot; and the &quot;heads on the stakes&quot; are nothing if they are not sensual. When we read, &quot;she rang under my feet like an empty Huntley &amp; Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along the gutter,&quot; we can see it and hear it and almost feel the vibrations of the tin.Conrad portrays darkness as being universal. All men can relate to the drums, there's a great passage where Conrad explicitly says so, &quot;Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend.&quot; There are implicit phrases as well, woven neatly around the events. &quot;I assure you that never before, did this land, this river, this jungle, the very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hopeless, and so dark.&quot; The narrator, himself, even wonders about his own darkness. In the book the darkness is related to health, to success, to savages, and to humanity. To all things.Memory verses sense of memory: Kurtz's story couldn't be real memory, but only perceptions of memory, mutated with time, flourished by the total experience. We know that Conrad himself underwent experiences similar to those of the narrator of his story. Are we to then assume that the writer's memory has been fictionalized?The rape of the land, the consequences to the soul, the temptation of solitude, become a dark challenge, constructing moral dilemmas. Kurtz discovers, &quot;He was empty inside.&quot; His words, &quot;the horror, the horror&quot; display what he, homself, had become at the end.There was a homologous hegemony. For as much as the natives were influenced by the white men's guns and mechanical wonders, the whites didn't have a chance of not being influenced themselves. &quot;(White) men that come out here should have no entrails.&quot; They were savages, even the pisher assistant to Kurtz, who couldn't discern taking the human heads off the stakes in the ground. Kurtz began his journey believing he wasn't corrupt like the others, he perceived himself as being in control. But the jungle changes all who enter it. They become wild and uncivilized. For all of their manicuring and white collared shirts, their symbolic clinging to systems that didn't apply, they acted as beasts. &quot;His starched collars and got-up shirt fronts were achievements of character.&quot;&quot;Just kill this guy if we need to...there are no laws here.&quot; Yet, there were laws. There were natural laws. The geographically transplanted white men were so far removed from imposed structured laws, that they were ill equipped to survive in nature, to respond to its own innate laws. Civilized man no longer saw himself as part of nature. He was not just separate but superior and impious. He irresponsibly answered to no one. He was corrupt, imprisoning the natives, stealing from them, plundering the earth's ivory, murdering anyone he wanted.Conrad's own description sums up the heart of darkness portrayed so vividly in this book: &quot;They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word \`ivory' rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in my life. And outside the silent wilderness surrounding this clear speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is a very unusual book, dealing with colonialism, barbarianism, insanity and mental torment. Unfortunetly the Author, Joseph Conrad, has written more than I, and most people will ever be able to grasp with our simple minds that cherish only literal things like M-TV and McDonalds. Yes, I, as a highschool student found this book incredibly tedious and hard to read, but I know that there is so much inside this book. It is a shame that when something truely real comes along, no one is smart enough to realize it.

Conrad's Heart of Darkness was my second undertaking in the spring/summer of '98. It is the brilliant narrative of Marlowe, a seaman, who unravels to his fellow crewmen the details surrounding his search for the enigmatic figure of Kurtz in the dark depths of the african wilderness. Conrad brings up the question of faith: it is faith in the mystery of life that allows a person to transcend the boundaries imposed on him by the combined forces of human curiosity and an unexplainable universe. An enigmatic universe. Heart of Darkness' message is itself veiled by mystery. Its 100 pages breed ideas. It showed me that internalized human forces are not beneficial to our knowledge of life until they are externalized and examined on our mental dissecting tables. According to Conrad, we must turn ourselves inside out under the lense of introspective thought and shed light upon our innermost selves. Heart of Darkness helps a person do exactly this. This is futile though. Conrad shows that we are enigmas to our own selves.Its 100 pages breed ideas exponentially in a dead brain.It serves as a reminder that good books will explode in your face.Should we allow &quot;the changing immensity of life glide past by, veiled by a sense of mystery or by a slightly disdainful ignorance[?]&quot; (Conrad) This is a genuine recommendation. - Ben."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The words, &quot;brooding&quot; and &quot;gloom&quot; appear in four of the first five paragraphs of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.

Conrad seasons the narrative with images of evolution. The story is told aboard a yacht at anchor, riding out the tide in the Thames, a waterway that led &quot;to the uttermost ends of the earth,&quot; even &quot;to the night of the first ages.&quot; Scientists speak of early man as if he lived long ago, but Marlow, the narrator, guides the reader to him on a &quot;sea of inexorable time&quot; to the other &quot;end of countless ages . . . to the beginning of time.&quot; The journey itself is a voyage to Africa and up the Congo River in search of ivory.

The journey upriver is supposed to be difficult, dark, dangerous, and hard to get through -- and reading the book is an experience of exactly the same sort. And not in the sense that the book is badly written or boring. No, it's more like the *experience of reading* the book mirrors the experiences *in* the book. And that, in itself, is quite an accomplishment! There is also a touch of brilliance in the morally ambiguous archetypes presented in the story. You can read it once (or less than once, as with my many previous attempts), and something about it stays with you. Like a bad rash.

His name was Joseph Conrad.Joseph Conrad was born in 1857 as J&oacute;sef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski. He spent the first twelve years of his life in the Ukraine, until the death of both parents caused him to move to an uncle in Switzerland. Not long after, when he neared his twenties, he made a decision that would greatly influence his literary career of later years: he joined the French merchant marine and made three voyages to the West Indies, later switching to the British merchant navy. Eventually, at the age of twenty-nine, he became commander of his own ship, the Otago. Concurrently he received British citizenship and officially changed his name to Joseph Conrad.During his long voyages he started to write; and what was more natural to him than to write stories related to seamanship and colonialism? His first novel, Almayer's Folly, appeared in 1895 and depicts a Dutchman who trades on the jungle rivers of Borneo. Several more novels followed, among them the book that is the subject of this review: Heart of Darkness. It was published in 1902 and was largely inspired by Mr. Conrad's trip up the Congo River in Africa.Why he wrote it? He wrote it for the same reason that he wrote all his books: \\"My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel-it is, above all, to make you see. That-and no more, and it is everything\\" (preface to The Nigger of the \`Narcissus', published in 1897). In other words, he wanted the millions of Europeans who had not been to the colonies, to get a glimpse of his own experiences.But what were his experiences? They were certainly not all positive, that much we can say. As Heart of Darkness elucidates, Conrad saw in the European colonization of the world not so much a glorious conquest as rather a greedy possessing of things not rightfully European. The following quote illustrates this particularly well: \\"You should have heard him say, \`My ivory.' Oh yes, I heard him. \`My intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my-' everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in the places. Everything belonged to him-but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own.\\"As for the story line and main characters, they can be summed up very quickly, for the narrative thread is thin and the main characters are few. The story is narrated by a sailor called Marlow, who tells his friends about his past journey in Africa. It runs thus:Marlow works for a company whose only interest lies in obtaining as much ivory as possible, irrespective of human damage. His particular mission in the story is to reach an agent of the company, called Mr. Kurtz, who has the reputation of being a very persuasive character. Once Marlow reaches Kurtz, he finds that the latter has made himself into the god of the native Africans of the area. What is worse, he uses his \\"divine\\" position to commit many atrocities. It suffices to say that he decorates his hut with human skulls.Kurtz, however, is seriously ill and dies not long after Marlow meets him. Which leads us to the central scene of the book: Kurtz's last words when he dies. It seems that in his last moments on earth he has a self-revelation of his true character: \\"It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of somber pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror-of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision-he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath-\\"The horror! The horror!\\"\\"The horror! The horror!\\"-this simple exclamation sums up the whole book. It is about the horror of what went on in the colonies: the horror of Europeans being taken out of the boundaries of European civilization and consequently turning into greedy gods, into \\"strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men-men, I tell you.\\""},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.This review of the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is pretty good if I do say so myself.

Next, I read Heart Of Darkness, lets just say I dont want to go back down that memory road again. Both short stories are very complicated and are not for youg readers. Although I have read many great classics, Heart Of Darkness is by far the most complicated and aggravateing short story I have ever read. Some novels are worth the difficulty, because they are really good, but Heart of Darkness is not worth reading. Neither is The Secret Sharer. This is the most dissapointing piece of so called &quot;classic literature&quot; I have ever read. )-:"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I think that The Heart of Darkness is a very unique book. It was written to make people to think and wonders. I think it was made for people so they can understand whats going on in other places. Joseph wanted people to see whats going on in Africa, that they think wasnt happening. This book was written for an audience who wonders about whats going on in other areas. It was made for people who dont know anything about the congo. This book was made for people who have good imagination and like dramactic stuff. The only thing I think that attracts people to read this book is the title of the book. The title of the book makes you wonders if its about love or something else. This book would be considered a classic because it was made to tell everybody about whats happening certain places around the world including the congo. This book was made with complexity, style, and drama. It is an understanding of the ways things was going in the congo. This book is a classic because it was the master of tradegy of moral desolation and win against egoism.

It all starts out with a steamboat captain named marlow, who tells his story. MArlow tells of a story were he gets the job as a steamboat captain and meets a man named mr. Kurtz. a man who sends in a lot of ivory.when Marlow finally gets to he steamer, he learns that it has been sunk, and is in need for repair. Yet he expects it to be intentional, so that he will not be reaching kurtz. IT takes up to 3 months to dredge out the ship. On one perticular evening, he overhears 2 men discussing kurtz. Marlow hears word that all the donkeys on a certain expedition have dide, and forces it to stop. By now his ship is nearly complete, and he can ,ake his way up the river to Kurtz. It isa dangerous river, and the trip will be difficult. He will only make it with the help of the natives, wich are proved to be cannabils, yet they are reasonable people. all through the night u can hear the tribes drums and occasionally see them. Marlow almosts feels a sense of kinship between him ans the savages. 50 miles away from kurstz, the steamer spots a hut with stacks of wood, they take aboard the wood, and carry on. 2 days later, there are only 8 miles from kurtz a strange silence and stilness follows a heavy fog. out in the distance, they hear a loud cry followed by voices. the crewman prepare for attack. Marlow doesnt wanty to continue in the fog because of the risk of crashing. they are one and a half miles from kurtz, when arrows come flying from the bushes, they are under attack. the crew opens fire on them, and the helsman star shooting from the window. The helsman is caught in the crossfire, and is killed by a spear. At this point, marlow tells his friends what kurtz is like. at this time, marlow is unsure whether or not kurtz was worth the fallen lives. he blames all the deaths on the own peoples. then a russian man on the shore tells them to come over,and that he knows theve been attacked, but that they are safe now. tyhis is the man whose wood they found, so they return it and greet eachother. the russian wants kurtz gone and begs marlow to take him away. none of the traders trust him. at this time, kurtz is brough out on a stretcher. marlow looks aout and sees his crew guarding ivory, but notices that kurtz has escaped to the natives. but marlow finds hiom and brings him back. the steamer departs the next day aat noon. on the way back, kurtz dies, and so they bury him. marlow becomes ill, but recovers,and returns to brussels. and this is were the story ends."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I am only a humble high school girl who was forced to read this as her summer reading assignment, so maybe I didn't understand the whole point of the book. I read the whole book in about four hours, and when I finished, I literally had no idea what I had just read. The language and sentences were overly convoluted, with some somewhat annoying grammatical errors in them (apparently Conrad's first language was not English), and I kept checking back to see if sections of the book had some sort of a deeper meaning (like the ruined book in the hut)... but couldn't find ANYTHING that really made sense.I won't go out and accuse Conrad of being racist or imperialist, because I really did not understand this book at all. I liked Lord of the Flies, the other book I was supposed to read, much better because I grasped the symbolism more easily. If you're looking for a good classic book, I suggest you try Lord of the Flies instead of trying to slog through this book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I found this book somewhat difficult to read and comprehend.

I would have never finished the thing had it not been a requisite for my English class. English being his non-native language, Conrad lulls the reader to sleep.

Watch Apocalypse Now."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If I had one chance to erase anything from my memory, the movie and novel The Heart of Darkness would be in the top rankings. This novel was very slow and confusing. The author's writing style did not help the misunderstanding that occurs from reading this book. However, I believe that the movie was worse off than the novel. I read the novel before I was forced to watch this tedious movie and it did not seem to help me to be less confused and bored. The movie was a horrible depiction of the book. There were many important concepts and items that were left out completely, changed, or moved to a different part of the movie. Some of those things were so important that it changed the plot of the movie. Joseph Conrad also managed to use an abundance of extra words in so many different areas that it was irritating. In concurrence with the movie leaving out pertinent facts, and the use of unnecessary details, the lack of interesting events made the book's progress very slowly. The most fascinating incident that took place was when Mfumu, the helmsman was killed. As you can see, the book and movie were very uneventful, with the most demented action being the most interesting. However, I give the screenplay writers props for reiterating the theme of the book and movie, futility. Whether it was intentional or not, Joseph Conrad and the director of the movie actually succeeded in creating a horrible story line and movie plot that helped me to catch up on my much needed sleep. So I guess some thanks are in order, because I am more rested and I have completed homework that would have remained unfinished."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The innocence of children is routinely destroyed in American classrooms with books like this. The fact that imperialism (although a lot of colonialism brought many good things to various cultures also) and evil people exist in all cultures is true. But books like this seem to promote the idea that evil is somehow European. The incredible negative focus in classrooms has devastated America as well as Europe. It is just part of more than a century of self destructive western writings beginning wih Karl Marx. Upton Sinclair wrote the Jungle as part of a self admitted promotion of Socialism. Unfortunately, Heart of Darkness is just another in a long line of books that promote self hate, or bitterness and rage, and event anti western sentiment that even people such as Stalin or the current terrorists use as motivation to kill \\"evil western imperialists.\\" Ironically Communist countries use this literature to teach hatred of the west. And here in the U.S. this literature is forced on American youth by the left wing. But also this type of literature is used by Christian and conservative schools. The destruction of western youth is coming from all sides. And I have seen many statements frm young people that their self mutilation and horrible self image stems from 12 years of chronic darkness taught to them by a decrepit school system that thrives on darkness. Heart of Darkness is just dark."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness truly defines the word \`boring'. Nothing in this book captured my interest, and made me wish I was anywhere but in front of that dull piece of literature. Perhaps the way in which the author, Joseph Conrad, went about writing the book contributed to the confusion that I encountered when reading it. The characters were lifeless, the plot was pointless, and the overall story itself was a waste of time to read. Unless you enjoy reading difficult stories, I would not recommend this novel to anyone.The movie was in fact not any means of improvement. The whole movie seemed dark and negative, and even the characters seemed bored. There is no way anyone would understand the film without reading and understanding every sentence of the book. I was even lost in the movie after I read the Heart of Darkness! The only reason the movie was more enjoyable than the book was because it didn't take long to get through it, unlike the novel which took a few months to dissect. The actors did perform very well considering the storyline that they were working with. The film and the novel were packed with large words that were too complex to understand unless you have a dictionary beside you or a much more developed brain than most. In other words, the film and the book was a waste of time and therefore, I would not suggest reading or watching any form of Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Under a darkening sky, a group of sailors in the Thames delta listens to a story about Africa, a steamboat journey, and the strange, broken director of an ivory-post in the Belgian Congo. It is a captivating premise, executed with tremndous force by Joseph Conrad in 'Heart of Darkness', a novella which holds its own against the giants of modern literature. In Conrad's hands, colonial Africa is a surreal backdrop, its population, conquerers and landscape reduced to icons and elements - the chemistry here is hardly tangible. While 'Heart of Darkness' could easily have descended into social commentary, striking out at the ills of colonialism, Conrad is in pursuit of something less tangible than human evil - this novella chases the nature of evil itself.Mr. Kurtz, the narrative focal point of 'Heart of Darkness', remains only a rumor until the last quarter of the text; Marlow, hypnotized by tales of his exploits, ventures deeper into the Congo to find him. Marlow is no explorer, however. Riding a steamboat piloted by others, its course dictated by the turn of the river, Marlow is forced into a sort of numbed complacency. The final meeting between Marlow and Kurtz is mesmerizing. A sickley, damaged phantom, Mr. Kurtz ruthlessly presides over a clan of native slave laborers. Kurtz is a casualty of the jungle - so removed from the all things familiar, he has succumbed to evil, unwittingly, unhappily.To Conrad, evil is what fills voids; it replaces lonliness, confusion, and fear. The inner Congo is an alien wasteland to westerners Marlow and Kurtz. By the time Kurtz utters his famous swan song, 'the horror... the horror,' it is clear that he is only a shadow of Marlow. Marlow, once so familiar to the reader, has become empty as well.This is a magnificent piece of fiction. Conrad's prose, admitedly, pay far less attention to narrative than to impressionistic poetry. But what incredible poetry it is. The rusted machines, the tall grass, Marlow's haunting vision of Kurrtz devouring the world, the woman weaving in the chair, and the darkness... the immeasuarble, infintely empty heart of darkness, gathering in the clouds, engulfing the horizon..."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad was a naturalized Britist novelist of Polish descent. He took command of a steamship in Belgian Congo in 1890 and his experiences provided the backbone for \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" resulting in an autobiographical component to the novel. The story is being told of Marlow who travels up the River Congo into the heart of the African Continent, at the height of European colonialism. Throughtout the perilous journey Marlow suffers a profound transformation on his outlook into human nature, plunging him into darkness. Being brought up as a middle-class European he holds pre-conceived views of the African continent and its inhabitants, describing the natives with condescension and contempt. Despite his prejudices he is not able to remain indifferent to the cruelty and horrors of colonization, the hypocrisy, the erosion of moral values, the brutality imposed by a \\"technically\\" advanced nation over a primitive one.Marlow becomes obsessed by his goal to meet Kurtz, a mystical character who has become famous for his sucess in extracting an enormous amount of ivory, and who by the use of sheer brutality has gained respect and is revered as a god amongst the natives. Deep inside Marlow holds the hope that Kurtz will be able to give him a logical, morally accepted justification for the horrors he has seen. When the meeting does take place, Marlow finds Kurtz has become a savage himself, has lost ties to any respectable western moral standard, has plunged himself into insanity and \\"horor, horror!\\"The prose is powerful, elaborate, exuberant and realistic, immersing the reader into a tropical atmosphere, with humidity, dampness, fog, heat, mystery and bewilderment. There is a ample use of symbolism conveying abstract and philosophical concepts. \\"Heart of Darkness\\" represents a bleak outlook of reality, much as most of Joseph Conrad's novels; at its most abstract level it represents the inability of human beings to understand the world beyond the self, of how civilization masks the inherited evil in human kind, of alienation and confusion. From a pragmatic point of view it fails to the extent that Marlow's position is ambiguous, he is eyewitness to horror but remains passive, unwilling to change the course of events, a fatalistic stand.Undoubtedly, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" drew plot elements from \\"Heart of Darkeness,\\" and so did Alvaro Mutis in his novel \\"La Nieve del Almirante.\\" Good suggestions to complement the scope of \\"Heart of Darkeness\\" are \\"King's Leopold Ghost\\" by Adam Hochschild, and \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" by Barbara Kingsolver."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is a novella that really needs to be read more than just once to fully appreciate Conrad's style of writing. The story is an account of one man's simultaneous journey into the darkness of a river as well as into the shadows of a madman's mind. There is a very brilliant flow of foreshadowing that Conrad brings to his writing that provides the reader with accounts of the time period and the horrible events to come. Through Conrad's illuminating writing style we slowly see how the narrator begins to understand the madness or darkness that surrounds him.I recommend this particular version of the novella because it contains a variety of essays, which discusses some of the main issues in the reading and historical information. Issues like racism and colonialism are discussed throughout many essays. It also contains essays on the movie inspired by the book Apocalypse Now, which is set against the background of the Vietnam War. I recommend reading Heart of Darkness and then viewing Apocalypse Now, especially in DVD format which contains an interesting directors commentary."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was assigned this book as summer reading for my senior AP Lit. class. Here are a few observations I made that might be useful to other students...1. Overall, it's a good read. It's short (brevity is beautiful), FULL of suspence, and very interesting. If you're thinking of skipping it and relying on Sparky or Cliff, please reconsider. Conrad's prose is deep and beautiful. The descriptions of \\"Patches,\\" the amiable Russian whose clothes are so patched they resemble the multicolor map of colonized Africa, are brilliant.2. That said, using a study guide alongside your reading is probably a good idea. Conrad is terribly subtle. I usually pick things up immediately, but I was a bit confused at the end. Online SparkNotes were somewhat helpful.3. I bought the Penguin Classics edition with an introduction and notes by Robert Hampson. The notes were helpful, but I thought the introduction was less than spectacular. As I said, I wanted to clarify a few things about Conrad's themes and characters, and Hampson didn't answer my questions. So either try a different edition with better analysis and criticism (Norton Critical perhaps) or get a companion study guide.4. Our class is reading Heart of Darkness together with Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart. Even if that novel (which is very good, by the way) isn't on your list, you'll likely be asked in some way to respond to Achebe's criticism of Conrad. Penguin actually dealt fairly well with the Achebe issue and provided a response; however, I imagine Norton deals with it equally well if not better. It might be worth your while to pick up a book that you know covers that issue."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Recently criticized by PC \\"academics\\" for its racism, Heart of Darkness remains one of the best books ever written. Yes, the book is racist, but it is no different than most of the prejudices held by Western Europeans of the period. That doesn't detract from the fact that this book is beautifully written (Conrad's long, twisting sentences, like the River Marlow travels up, have inspired my writing style to a great degree) and works as an amazing allegory for the dual nature of humanity: the battle between man and the inner beast. Before you let anybody turn you off of this book for its racism or its long sentence structure, just give it a read-through (its very short, though there's a lot underneath the surface). This is one trip upriver you won't regret."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm not sure how to feel about this book. While reading it, I really could not become absorbed by Conrad's dense prose, though, while occasionaly eloquent, is very thick, and, well, British. But now that I am finished with it, I can not get the images the novella invokes out of my head. The conquest of Africa by the Imperialist on the surface, and the corruption of man's very morality underneath. The story is deceptively simple, merely a man working for an Ivory trading company, ominously called \\"The Company\\", going up the Congo river to meet up with Kurtz, the archetype of Western Imperialism. During this trip, we are shown the inner workings of man and his heart of darkness. The novella is not perfect though. Conrad's condemnation of Imperialism is uneven. Yes, the only discernable cause of Kurtz's descent into evil and madness is the imperialist ethic of master-slave, and it is fairly clear that Marlowe (conrad) is condemning that ethic, but at the same time, he doesn't work very hard to elevate the view of the African natives any higher in the esteem of his western readers. Anyway, as the novella is only about 100 pages, it is something that can be read in a day. Invest an afternoon in it, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"For all of those people who wrote a review of Heart of Darkness after having been &quot;forced&quot; to do so by some high school English teacher, let me assure you that by writing this novel off as a tedious way to waste your youth, you are missing out on a world of wisdom delivered in under a hundred pages. You have to realize that this man was there at whatever the heart of darkness may be and the novel isn't his best guess at what happens when all constraints of modern society are removed and humans are left to fend for their own existence. This is knowledge that can only be gained from first-hand experience of getting up to your elbows in all the crap that hides within the unconscious and making it back with even a shred of sanity.The first time I read this book was also for an English class, and just as many other reviewers, I saw no value in the whole exercise. But we had one of those old English professors who could talk about the novel for hours and tell you about all the symbols and how to really interpret what Conrad was saying. Since then, I've read Heart of Darkness maybe five more times, and each time, just as with a Dali painting, I find things I didn't notice before. And I'm always amazed to think that all these things which Conrad writes about could easily be sitting within any civilized person, waiting for the chance to emerge. Read it again, you'll see what I'm babbling about. :-)"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"'Heart of Darkness', the tale of a European seaman journeying up an African river, is a Chinese box of Chinese whispers. What perhaps strikes the first-time reader (like myself) first is the unbridgeable conflict between the work's apparent aim - the exposure of the barbaric reality behind the enlightenment propaganda of Imperialist bureaucracies - and its effect, a baffling nebulousness; this is matched by conflict between the prodigious exactness of Conrad's prose, and the vague thoughts, images, feelings, events it asks us to imagine.this sense of intangibility results primarily from the narration itself - Marlow's tale of the search for Kurtz is related to the reader by an intermediary narrator; it is told by a disembodied voice on a boat-trip one Thames night. Marlow's story is itself full of further removes, fragments of information pieced from stories, hints, unreliable statements and testimonies, paintings, myths, ciphers on books. the plot and its mechanics are always abstracted - the tangible trip up a geographical river becomes a journey back in time stripped of place-names or datemarks; an ambush takes place in a blinding fog; throughout, Marlow's ideas, equivocations, euphemisms, evasions and philosophical ruminations over what happens (specifically, what Kurtz has done) takes precedence over any concrete detail. The language constantly evokes dreams, nightmares, shades, phantoms - inanimate objects (such as abandoned machinery) become signs of desolating death, more articulate than the dead humans in similar positions.'Heart' is usually seen as the first masterpiece of the 20th century and one of the key modernist texts, but, for me, its effect was similar to a much older literary genre, the Gothic, the 'horror, horror' story. The elaborate framing narrative devices; the emphasis on physical and mental deterioration; the doppelganger motif (Marlow and Kurtz echo each other throughout, not least as disembodied voices bewitching their listeners on boats), the intimations of the Satanic and 'I Walked with a Zombie' sacrifices-in-the-bush atmosphere; the move from 'enlightened, time-bound civilisation to barbaric, timeless primitivism; from a social order to a boundless nightmare. The African landscape is shaped by references to key Western texts of the supernatural, from Virgil to Dante to Perrault.Conrad follows his master Henry James' lead here, using verbal precision to articulate an unidentified and unidentifiable black hole, and 'Heart' is, along with 'the Turn of the Screw', the scariest, dread-freezing book I have ever read. Like the Gothic, therefore, Conrad is not simply concerned with the unpalatable realities of a particular political system, but the individual unfathomabilities that allow them to happen; if we feel this somehow cheats the critique by obscuring it, than, a century of 'the horror' later, can we say we are any more articulate than Marlow?(Of all the editions of 'Heart' available, I would recommend two, both, curiously, published by Penguin in 1995. that by John Lyon, returns the novella to its original book-form, as the second of a trilogy including 'Youth' and 'The end of the tether'; his introduction brilliantly analyses the formal minutae of Conrad's art, its structures and details, the way the difficult demands it makes on the reader provoke the story's themes, effect and meaning.That by Robert Hampson, which reproduces Conrad's 'Congo Diary' of the 1890 trip that partly inspired the novella, places 'Heart' in its original context, the culmination of 19th century European expansion in Africa, with its attendant justifications and anxieties, including among the many prototypes for Kurtz, H M Stanley (of '...and Livingstone' fame), an aggressive, murderous, capitalistic imperialist. he convincingly defends 'Heart', a text much vilified by post-colonial and feminist critics from charges of collusive racism and misogyny, reminding us not to confuse a writer with his hero, demonstrating the devices employed by Conrad to distanciate the two)."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness has \\"public domain\\" status, which means anyone can type it up and distribute it, which is exactly what happened in this case. The Filiquarian Publishing version was clearly just typed up in Word, hardly edited, if at all, printed, and bound.

Normally I love Norton editions because the footnotes provide so much information and create the context for the story. The Norton edition of Wide Sargasso Sea is a great example; all types of historical footnotes about Jamaica and the situation in the Caribbean at that time fill the text. This edition, while it has articles that prove to be useful, is severely lacking in notation for the text itself. Heart of Darkness is a notoriously difficult novel to read and the notes provide little information. For instance, on p. 9 the narrator mentions arriving in a city that makes him think of a \\"white sepulchre.\\" This city is Brussels, but there is no footnote saying so. The next page the narrator meets \\"The great man himself\\" which I'm guessing is Leopold, but again, no footnote. There are tons of similar examples. You have to be very familiar with the history of the Belgium Congo to understand the book, and Norton Editions are usually great for readers who aren't as familiar with the context of the work but this one is an exception to that case.

The novel was initially published in magazine anthology form and was probably very effective in this manner. In reading the novel, however, I found the descriptions of Kurtz (who happens to be the most integral character in the novel) to be much too terse and inneffective. The character of Marlow is sufficient and following his progress up the river into the heart of Africa is intriguing and keeps the pages turning. However, all the buildup leading to the final meeting with the ambitious Kurtz leaves one frustrated with the lack of description that is eventually found. If the reader is waiting for a great man with almost superhuman knowledge of what we all face in our existence, they will be left wanting with the pale, sickly man they come across. Sure, &quot;The Horror, The Horror...&quot; is a great plot device to make all of us question the nature of death and our lives, but I feel another 100 pages could have been written to establish what could have been one of the most fascinating characters in modern fiction.

Disappointing with great possibility.........."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Id like to make some comments on the culture and style of writing by offering you a challenge. While Heart of Darkness is of course an important work, it is one of the last works of the expressive style put in the grave by Hemmingway and Steinbeck and the like.Just for fun, read another story set against the sea, The Old Man and the Sea. Think about the style and how the author presents things to you. Are the characters self consious? Does the author try to form every reaction you might have, to brace every word with a thought?Now, after you finish Old Man, try reading the first five pages or HoD. In comparison, it will be like trying to run through waist deep snow. Every time Conrad looks across a glimmer of a shadow of a breaking wave's spray, he has a thousand throughts and tangents and every word is chosen with a new precision. It reminds me of the adage that the Inuit have 47 words for snow.Old Man is told with a vocabulary of a hundred words and effortlessly is in touch with subject matter by striking at the heart of the reader where Heart of Darkness is like a sharp stick caught in your brain.Just a thought or two."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I had to read a fiction book for my Sophomore English class; we received a list of books on college and many other's top ten lists. I had scored really high on a reading test and decided that I should go for on of the harder books. Don't let the title deceive you, Heart of Darkness might seem like a murder mystery, or a dark story from a famous authors mind, but be forewarned: this book is not an easy book to get through. This book explores deep into the aspects of one mans thoughts as he journeys down a river as an ivory boat captain. This story tells of a man and a whole legacy he has built up and how great he is and about the man seeks him out on a ship with rumors growing more and more colossal. When you finally meet him you are greatly disappointed at the sick pathetic man you read about. Joseph Conrad was a deep intellectual writer. This was written in the early 1900's and so it is also a different writing style than the kind writers use nowadays so you might not get what you'd expect. I would highly recommend being around College level before reading this. Not for the sake of understanding it, but from the tolerance high school will give you when reading boring books."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Too outdated for me.

It was delivered in satisfactory time, no complaints."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"After reading Heart of Darkness, one of English Literature's great works, one question will come to the reader's mind: Are people really that heartless? An allusion to the imperialism era, Joseph Conrad centers the story of Marlow's adventure into the African jungle with story of human corruption, greed, and lust for power. Readers are just like the main character, Marlow, as the reader and he not only will learn, but also be disturbed by the dark secret of Kurtz; the secret of Kurtz's obsession for ivory and god-like status. But more interestingly, Joseph Conrad uses highly eccentric character development. What keeps this suspense in the story is that the author does not establish a clear and solid connection between the reader and the characters. Even though Marlow and Kurtz's character is revealed to some extent, the reader will have a hard time figuring out who the characters really are. For example, the readers will be perplexed by the two side of Kurtz: one is the multi-talented Kurtz who had come to help \\"civilize\\" Africa and other is the sick, brutal, and insane man who wants nothing but money and power. As the plot thickens, interestingly, the readers will notice the increasing darkness surrounding them as the imagery of shadows and blackness is more prevalent as the famous last words of Kurtz will disturb its listeners.These are some components of the Joseph Conrad brilliant style that are hidden deep within the story just waiting for the readers to explore. Readers must think critically as they read this novel or they will find this novel boring and difficult. However, every reader will understand and be marveled, yet troubled, by the Joseph Conrad's portray of heartless and materialistic human civilization; the real Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Apparently touted by the early (and literate!) American pundit H.L. Mencken, this brief novel recounted at sea is strongest in my opinion in its dreamy use of language. The plot, such as it is, concerns a voyage into the depths of partly colonized lands, namely Africa with its slaves and beasts and some natives who, unaccustomed to technology, are apt to regard civilization, such as it is, as aliens or gods. Although the story line is hazy (as it is in dreams), the renowned author succeeds in creating an exotic mood of gloom (one of his favorite words)-a mood exacerbated by the technical device of recounting at sea tales taking place in the midst of a continent. The character played by Marlon Brando in the film Apocalypse Now is supposedly based in part on the \\"central\\" character of this novel, Kurtz, who, like the character in the Coppola film, appears only fleetingly, the better to show his obscurantist power."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness by Conrad is a very short novella that is masterfully descriptive of its characters and locations but also happens to be incredibly uneventful and surprisingly lifeless for a book that attempts to bring us a unique vision of an Africa-come-trade fair.In short, this journey into the heart of darkness should have been a little more engaging but just happens to pass from one page to next without any drama, suspense, intrigue or mystery. Sure Conrad can describe his locations, characters and their thoughts beautifully when he renders them onto the page but this novella just misses anything that might interest us, leaving each descriptive paragraph marred by dislocated reasons for being there at all. There are areas of this jungle that scream to be penetrated but are alas forgotten about or just left behind. As a story it also fails to stay coherent at the best of the times and even after repeat readings makes little or no sense.Conrad is leaving much up to our imagination but also frankly leaves gaps too big to be considered a structured plot. It is more like the ramblings of a drunken old sea worthy fool who between swigs of the ale forgets why he was talking in the first place, but at least continues along in a descriptive babbling that helps you make it to the last page.In short this story would have been better told by someone else who was there. It seems like the writer is struggling at the best of times to want to write it which probably explains its length as a novella. I am sure Conrad just got this one over and done with so that he could move onto a better piece of literature. It seems like a completed piece of work just for the sake of completing it.It is no wonder that many students will nod off during this one. You can not blame their youth for this snooze-fest. It is plain and simply boring and there is much better period novels out there that deal with similar themes. I am sure swapping this one for something from Patrick O'Brian \\"Master and Commander\\" would make the class room more attentive."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Put simply, anyone who is &quot;forced&quot; to read this story as a requirement for his or her English class and who comes away with a foul taste in his or her mouth should either 1) think about changing majors or, 2) read the book again. Pay attention to the cadence in these scenes, the pauses, the important glimpses of humanity that Conrad *gives* us in the midst of this crash-and-burn nightmare. Whatever you do, don't give up on this book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"After reading a one star criticism of HoD,i was provoked to write this one. I just finished HoD and I must say that it was one of the more difficult novels to read and understand. Conrad forces the reader to think for him/herself, rather than simply state his implications. The novel is not simply about a journey into the heart of Africa, it is a journey into the heart of man, into hell, and into truth (there are countless interpretations). Conrad explores the inner evil in the heart of man by paralleling it to his journey into the heart of the Belgian Congo. He uses brilliant symbols and irony to convey his points. As many readers have discovered, the darkest hearts belonged to those with the lightest skin. Marlow, the man sent on the mission to relieve Kurtz, discovers his own dark heart and identifies with the cannibalistic navtives when he divulges his desire to go to the shore to join them for a &quot;whoop and a dance.&quot; He is able to reject the darkness and find his own light. Some of the most profound statements in literature may be found within the covers of HoD; of which my favorite is &quot;we live as we dream-alone.&quot; If you do not think this book is a five star, you have not truly read it or lack the intelligence to understand it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When I first read this novel, I hardly understand the content. After I read it over and over again. I could picture things in my head. Conrad really used alot of symbolism and Impressionism in his writing. He symbolized the light as the conscious perception of those forces that govern our lives and the darkness was the destructive, primitively harbored urges that dominate our characters. The man needs all self-knowledge and this knowledge is tenebrously compounded."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad is a master novelist that concentrates his efforts on the study of human behavior. This book shows how a person can degenerate into a savage. Similar behavior analysis can be found in Lord Jim. Both are excellent works. If you have seen Apocalypse Now, you should read the original story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness baffled many of my peers in senior english at Tabor in Marion, Mass. I decided to take it by the throat and came out deeply pondering life, death, and meaning. Upon reading Heart of Darkness I absorbed many of Conrad's controversial theories. The more you know, the more you realise you don't know, among others. Be warned, Marlow, the main character, is very inconclusive, stating that it is truly impossible to say what he means. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was pleased to see so many positive reviews which are up to date - I read the book for the first time in the seventies as high school set book - I dont think I understood anything at that age. I have read it twice since then and am intersted to see that each time I have a deeper insight into the ideas expressed so eloquently. I think one only can really understand the book as one lives through ones own life experiences. Five stars to Conrad's use of words to evoke a vivid visual image and feelings simultaneously. I am very impressed that the book is still being read today where a work such as this is in danger of being tuned out by the digital revolution and quick fixes of today's lifestyle."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When I first read this book I was very confused. I didn't know what was going on at all. You can easily drift away in a book like this. Conrad's vocabulary is so immense, I can see how someone can discourged by this book. But I can gurantee you that if you read this book a second or maybe even a third time. You'll start to understand the story a little better. Conrad really concentrates on good and evil and black and white in this book. How white people or people dressed in white don't always depict the good guy but rather the bad guy. I love how Conrad wrote this book, I love how this book took place within about a six hour time span. I thought that was neat."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The main complaint I hear about Heart of Darkness is that it drags through its story. This is a valid complaint and true enough, but the reward that are received from reading the story outway the sluggish telling. I can't think of another way to get the point across, and flashy fast pace writing would have run contrary to the theme. Conrad has a brilliant mind, and is writing to only a select group of readers. While the book isn't a jolly good time, it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I had to read this for AP English and it was the most difficult to understand, yet it is my favorite book. Conrad uses the most appropriate language to convey the idea that evil lurks within all men. Face it, we all would rather live in illusion than face reality. Marlow refuses to tell Kurtz's mistress the truth because it &quot;would have been too dark altogether.&quot; The incomprehensible amount of evil within men is for the most part hidden &quot;luckily, luckily.&quot; Finally, Kurtz even sees that he has lived an evil existence as he realizes &quot;The Horror! The Horror!...&quot; This book is a must read if you want to know a little more about the true nature of all men."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness served as a sharp critisism of the nature of man and man's ability to sell himself for material gain. It is unclear exactly who the hero of the story is because Kurtz is both a god and a devil in one. The long drawn out sentences, which were used to make the book ironic and deep, made the book almost painful to read. Each sentence contained what seemed like hundreds of words which made the book seem much longer than it's 100 pages. Whatever you do don't try to read this book all at once. You are bound to drift off and wake up the next morning with 99 pages left to go!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novella is one of those classics that people talk about more often than read. THere are references to it everywhere, from Apocalyse Now to journalism about Africa. Well, I sat down to read it and was unimpressed. Perhaps it is the horror COnrad wants to portray that put me off, but I didn't find it very believable and couldn't allow myself to be swept into the world he portrays. One of my tests for a book is that it makes me want to learn more, to go to other sources, and this one just didn't."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book was very hard to understand. There were too many words. These words cluttered up what was really going on in the book. The only reason why I read it was because I was assigned it for college. If you are having trouble falling asleep, read this book. I guarantee it will put you to sleep."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Boring!

To read it again now is to see it in the full light of meaning. I was very impressed with the digital version. I don't remember a single scanning error. After all these years it is still a page turner!!!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I just finished numerous exhaustive critical analyses of this book with my LIT500 MFA class. We debated all sorts of things about the way whites treat blacks in the book, how dark represents evil and light represents goods, the signs and signifiers and various other relative mumbo jumbo. What I came away with, and why I think Heart of Darkness is an important book, is its unvarnished, automatic racism. Few people who will read this review, no matter their ethnic heritage, will have experienced pervasive, almost omnipresent racism in their lifetimes. Sure, many 21st century Westerners know that slavery used to exist, and that Europeans and Americans used to societally, legally and categorically discriminate against and oppress Africans - Heart of Darkness will bring that to life, and it should be brought back to life for newer generations to understand.When a man is not a man, but merely an object to be used and thrown out when no longer useful, that is the Heart of Darkness. When anyone with darker skin color is an automatic savage, that is the Heart of Darkness. When a continent is naturally, obviously there solely for the amusement and profit of European nation-states and the respective kings, princes and plenipotentiaries of another continent, that is the Heart of Darkness. Everyone should fully fathom how deeply an ideology can destroy another culture, how entire civilizations, tribes and cultures have been thrown into the ash heaps of history simply because another civilization, tribe or culture could get away with it. Journey up the river, meet the cannibals, feel the automatic derision, and experience Kurtz' madness in that rapine world."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is a classic book indeed. I had never read it before and it pretty much kept my interest. Now I totally understand the phrase Death on a Stick. Reminded me of that scene late in the movie Apocalypse Now. Eerie."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is a book I've been meaning to read 'for real' since my senior year in high school. It is the one of only two books I have ever been assigned and not read completely. (The other is A Diary of Anne Frank and I feel horribly guilty over that one)So, I started Heart of Darkness for my AP English class, like I was supposed to, and then got bogged down in Conrad's endless description. So, I skimmed the rest, asked my English teacher for 'help' because I, 'didn't understand' the message, wrote my thesis paper, and got an A. :) No one ever knew.But, I always felt like I hadn't been fair to Mr. Conrad's book. I owned my AP copy, it's not even 80 pages, and I figured I could just read it and mark it off my slate of unfinished (shameful) reads. I even hoped that if I gave it another chance I wouldn't hate it so much the second time.Although it will never be one of my favorite books, I will say that Heart of Darkness was improved the second time around. I liked it much more this time (although that isn't saying much, since I loathed it the first). One of my earliest concerns with this book is the narrative voice. The narrator and the storyteller are two different people. People are sitting around a fire, listening to a man tell a story about his trip through the heart of the African Congo, and one of the men around the fire is telling it to us. It's weird, and it makes the descriptions and language that much stranger, because really... Even back then, who talks like that around a campfire?! I don't really see the point, and I thought it made the story more stilted than it needed to be.I also felt that a lot of the book was superfluous, which in a 78 page book is a problem. Nothing really happens until the end of the book. Now, I'm perfectly willing to admit my part in this. I know that I read this book faster than I should have, and that I missed some of the important parts to the story. But, I don't care. I still found a lot of it dull, meandering and pointless.There is a surprising amount of depth to this story. I missed it entirely the first time, because I was intentionally blocking out any meaning to the story, and I think I barely touched it this time, but I was impressed by what Conrad is able to convey in just 80 or so pages (closer to 40 or 50 if you consider that I felt the first half mostly irrelevant). But, once Kurtz becomes an important and active part of the story, I think you can learn a lot. Although I didn't love this book, and I doubt I ever will, I'd like to read it at least once more to try and glean more because I think there is more that this book could teach me."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book was physically painful to read. Reading this book made me want to stick a pencil in my ear and pull it out the other side. I did appreciate the attention to detail and I liked the plot, but the writing style is hideously attentive, he will go off on a tangent and write entire paragraphs to explain things that are both mundane and unrelated to the story as a whole. but if you feel like slugging through it, it's only 100 or so pages and for $4.00 you get to tell people that you read it and make yourslef look smart."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Took a while to get to my house, but a book's a book so I can't complain. It was cheap and just what I needed... what else can I say?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad expresses his radical views of colonization in the novel, published during a time when Europeans were in a rage of civilizing and converting the people of Africa into Christians. Conrad's revolutionary ideas are depicted through a story told by Marlow, a European seaman, on the deck of the Nellie, while waiting in the Thames River. The imperialistic views proposed are justified by the men's greed and futility. Their quest to find all of the ivory hidden deep in the heart of the Congo, overcomes their original intentions. Intertwined with irony, there is a distinct portrayal of the lives of men during that time. Although this novel is brief, the reader must thoroughly read the text to comprehend the meaning beneath Marlow's adventure story. One must metaphorically read between the lines to grasp the author's intentions in the book. Regardless of the difficulty of the text, this book does not keep you on the edge of your seat. It moves slowly, mainly because it is so descriptive. It is a pleasurable piece of literature that can be accompanied by a film version."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If you like to read books that give you the feeling of being transported to another time and space where you feel almost claustraphobic or trapped within the books own inner atmosphere, then this is the book for you. Conrad's prose is so dense and thick that reading it may seem heavy and sluggish, but so is the jungle where the story takes place, there is little directness in the storyline and the characters are far from simple to understand. Conrad's use of the language may make it seem like it was translated from another language (Conrad's native language wasn't english) but it is still a fascinating journey both into the 'heart of darkness' of the river, the jungle, the savagery, 'the horror'. If you have been lucky enough to see the film 'Apocalypse Now' I recommend you not to have any expectations on this book basing yourself on the movie. The character Kurtz in this book is a lot more misterious and it is left to the reader to judge him, not the other way around. Marlow, the main character and probably Conrad's alter ego, is also a fascinating specimen, you arent really ever 100% sure of his nature or of his phylosophy. The trip itself through the river and the jungles of the African Congo are descriptive and heavily detailed passages that almost make you feel the dampness and savagery of the jungle. These pages are very realistic, probably because Conrad himself experienced trips through that african wilderness as a young man. It is also historically valuable and the reader can make out his own mind on a lot of different issues such as civilization, savagery, violence (both physical and psychological), the nature of human beings, idolatry, etc. It is a book you will either love because it made you 'feel' and 'think', you will probably want to read it again, or you might feel it is heavyhanded and a difficult hard read, but then again, it deserves a second shot. A highly recommended book that will [draw] you in and will not dissapoint those willing to take on the journey! A solid 9 out of 10!!!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad writes with the sort of depth rarely exhibited by an English language writer. This is one of the most challenging and best written books that I have ever read. Some of the quotes alone could be collected into a masterpiece. Attention should be paid to the dream-like narrative of Marlow's tale (if you must know - of a European man traveling into the heart of Africa). Conrad understood many things about human nature which are buried in the text. This is not just a colonial novel. The major accomplishment here is combining smart philosophy with a deft style, something rarely achieved by writers bent on espousing their views. This is an important book and should not be missed by anyone interested in superb writing and great literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I like to read this book, because it is mysterious. I would like to learn more about this book, because I like Joseph Conrad's expriences. The description is very clear and uderstandable. The characterization reveals personalized experiences. Overall, the book is wonderful."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Did you ever read a book, only to realise that you haven't paid attention to a single thing? That it wasn't engaging at all? Well, this is how this novel affected me. The only thing it had going for it was its length. Boring and dull. Probably better off watching 'Apocalypse Now', which being loosely based on this novel, is far superior. Avoid this book at all costs. Unless you are an English student and have to read it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If your idea of a good time is reading a book that feels like it's entirely exposition (eschewing such literary novelties as, say, rising action, or a real climax), then &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is for you and stay away from me! The gist of the book is that white people who think they're civilized are actually far more savage than the &quot;barbarians&quot; they try to &quot;civilize.&quot; I could've got the same lesson by listening to a Midnight Oil song and gotten on with my life, rather than wading through this detail-drenched, pompously &quot;symbolic&quot; waste of time.I'm not one of those people who insists that a book contain a sex scene or violent act every few pages to keep my attention, but NOTHING HAPPENS in this whole book! We're supposed to be supremely affected by it all. Life's too short for this kind of bombast. -Chris Willie Williams"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I got through Heart of Darkness by writing myself notes in the margins to help me figure out and remember what was happening. If you're being forced to read this, look at it from an analytical point of view and you might get through it. See it as an object to be studied rather than a thing to be enjoyed.After I was finished, the one question I asked myself was, \\"what was I supposed to get from this?\\" Heart of Darkness is dense and bland, however, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be explored.I explored it, and am appreciative for the experience; but, don't hold your breath waiting for me to pick it up again any time soon."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I am in no way unaccustomed to classical literature and have read many a book which, though the language, being non-contemporary, has been difficult yet immensely rewarding. Heart of Darkness is however no such book.Conrad cannot help himself but to create sentences which are comprised 90% of adjectives. I must agree with Ryen Lapham's review - the content of the book is worthy of a short story alone - some 30 pages, but is stretched out over 100 and feels three times the size.I was positively exhausted after reading this book. The feeling was one of listening to someone with a strong accent whom I struggled to understand. I found the constant streams of adjectives and lack of content placed me in a state of meditation and I often had to reread pages again and again because my mind was constantly wandering off. Even then, on many occasion, I struggled to understand what was going on.Conrad constantly jumps topics and within a few words he has moved from confronting Kurtz in the jungle to chugging off in his steam boat. It is totally confusing - who is in the steam boat - where are all the natives - where is Kurtz (two words ago Conrad had mentioned him in his cabin). The book is similar throughout.Though he does challange many of the myths of Imprerialism of his time his view of the 'savages' is amazingly patronising and his constant referral to them as cannibals is not only wholly incorrect but insulting. I felt at times Conrad's view of the blacks wasn't far off the derogatory views of those that he is attacking.I must admit, after rushing to finish this novel (for the wrong reasons) my last words are too - \\"The horror! The horror!\\""},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was forced to reread this book after purchasing the more recent \\"King Leopold's Ghost,\\" which I have also reviewed.Even though Conrad's book was a novel based loosely on events he, or other had witnessed, the events in \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" were not fiction at all, but the \\"real modern day deal.\\"It was this novel that was the first to expose the true horrors of European colonialism on the African continent. It tells the story of a supremely successful collector of Elephant tusks, which were being taken from the Belgian Congo for the purpose of trading them on the world market for ivory. Kurz's business was successful only because of the brutality and immorality of his techniques: He swindled, stole and killed Africans in the hundreds if not the thousands to stay ahead of the competition. And just as happened a generation later, by the diminutive and brutal Belgian King, no one asked any questions about his brutal techniques.The phrase\\" The Heart of Darkness,\\" referring to the heart of the white colonists, came to replace the phrase \\"darkest Africa\\" as a result of this novel. Its beauty lies in Conrad's failed attempt to re-humanize Kurtz as a symbolic image of redemption in the name of all the white colonists that had heaped carnage upon Africa.But the author's efforts fell short both in the novel and in reality because in Conrad's hands, Kurtz was turned into \\"a less than ideal moral man.\\" He became a man who learned to come to grips with the evil he had spawn, by discovering that he was not an inherently wicked man, but one who was god-fearing and capable of the \\"natural moral superiority\\" that the white man was supposed to have over the more savage Africans. The question of which man was the more savage was left \\"hanging in the air\\" in the novel.Unless you are white, turning to \\"the white man's religion\\" where moral superiority is still claimed by fiat is not much redemption. But at least it is something. Apparently the novel did not have the desired moral effect in reality either, as history can attest. It may in fact well have had just the opposite effect: as the Belgians repeated the same ghastly and brutal experiment a generation later, only this time with diamonds instead of ivory. Despite all this, and the goriness of the content, it is still a powerfully told story by a master of his craft.Five Stars"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Heart of Darkness is a book for a more advanced reader. There is about 5 times more happening than is actually written. In order to interpret all of this information, you must read between the lines.

I've been told that watching Apocalypse Now doesn't count; but if you have read and seen the movie, fun can be found spotting the similarities. Heart of Darkness is a difficult book to read but if you stick with it, there is a certain elegance in the novel, as well as the fact it's heavily symbolic.One of the more interesting aspects of this novel is the narrative style. It's not narrated by the protagonist Marlow but an unnamed listener of his stories. Almost like the narrator is the reader, standing there listening to Marlow tell his tales. This is happening while the boat anchored on the River Thames near London, thou his tails are of him captaining a steamship in Africa.The blend of feeling like a shipmate listening to the tales, and the fact that Marlow struggles to talk about the torments, makes this an excellent representation of the Duality of human nature. While it was a fantastic book, the writing style did make it difficult to enjoy this book as much as I wanted to."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I miraculously finished my last book club book before we met, which is amazing considering I'm such a slow reader. I had a week or so before the next meeting and needed another book to read before then. So I picked the shortest book that I owned. While it was short (about 150 pages) it took me way too long to read. Overall I'm glad that I read it - I'd owned it for a while and knew it was a classic I'd eventually read. But it felt like I was in school again. It was a bit of a chore. It was written in 1905 and the author's 3rd language was English. These two factors made it a little hard to get through.The book begins as Marlow, a ship Captain, is off again to sea. As they set out he tells of his recent journey to his shipmates. He recounts his experience sailing to Africa and his subsequent expedition to find Kurtz, a man employed by the same company, that has disappeared into the jungle in search of ivory. He eventually finds Kurtz, only to discover Kurtz has gone mad due to various illnesses and is living among the locals in a most savage way.I had a hard time understanding why Kurtz was so revered. It was an undisputed fact that he was an amazing genius. But his actual part in the book was so tiny that it was hard to really buy into it. I also thought it would be more about the horrors of imperialism and recount awful conditions and scenes he was witness to - but that was a very, very small part of the book. Glad that I read the book, but glad to have it over with, too."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Throughout the history of civilization, superpowers have used the precept of morality and a self-serving interpretation of good versus evil to further their economic and political stronghold. Such an example lives in Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, where racism, sexism, human rights violations and economic imperialism collide to expose a chilling example of the darkest side of human nature. Through the storyteller, Marlow, Conrad recounts his personal experiences in the Congo, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, and opening up a Pandora's Box of controversy and debate which will, for more than a century, cast doubt on his own morality and motivation.[...]"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"this was my first purchase from amazon and I am very pleased.

I would recommend \\"Rivers Ran East\\" before reading this."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Very good book, but a slow read. Crams a lot of depth and meaning into just a 100+ pages."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Though Joseph Conrad's famous novella, Heart of Darkness, can teach us much about human nature, it can also very easily put us to sleep. The powerful characters and their intriguing motives Conrad expresses in his novella opened our eyes to the extreme lengths people will go to in order to climb the social ladder ultimately becoming \\"top dog\\". It also exposed us to the harsh and often over-looked world of African racism in its rawest and truest form. This concept was quite new to us considering all we have previously been taught about racism was the overexposed aspect of racism in United States history. If only Conrad had made his writing as exciting and interesting as the in-depth themes he conveyed in Heart of Darkness, perhaps more readers would discover it in all its glory.A constant struggle for power is an underlying theme throughout Conrad's novella. It is interesting to watch the development of characters as their thirst for power strengthens. The Manager, for example, becomes more and more distressed and desperate to overpower Marlow each time Marlow opposes one of the Manager's decisions. For example, in Part I of the novella, Conrad describes the rational behind the French's violence toward a seemingly harmless area on the coast. After the French bombarded the area, \\"nothing happened. Nothing could happen\\" (Conrad 79). It is obvious the French were not fighting for protection, but solely to demonstrate their dominance over the Natives they fear. This relationship is a fascinating study of human nature, and is very relatable to today's society. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for people to become so blinded by their desires, that they reach the point where they no longer remember why they desired it in the first place. Conrad's characters show us that the greed and yearning for supremacy seen in his book is actually much more common in our lives than we first assume.If you were to ask anyone in our age group about racism nine times out of ten they would respond with a fact or figure dealing with racism as a part of United States history, especially topics of slavery. Very little is taught about racism in other forms and in other locations. Heart of Darkness portrays a society in which the ones that are oppressed by racism are, not only, the people native to the land, but also the majority. After seeing the way the European settlers imposed their own society and beliefs upon the natives, it reminded us that racism and domination are not only seen in minority groups. As famed author Chinua Achebe tells us in his critique titled \\"An Image of Africa\\", Conrad sets his novel up in a way that \\"foils Africa to Europe\\" (Achebe 1). Despite the surface differences between Europe and Africa, there is an underlying consistency in human nature to fear those who appear foreign and \\"strange\\". This leads the Europeans to have the desire to control their foils, the Natives. The invading Belgium travelers oppressed the people native to the land solely because of their skin color. After investigation, it is obvious this prevalent theme can be easily found in the history of our own country, The Unites States. This unique form of racism can be found as far back in our own country's history as the way the first pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower treated the Native Americans despite the pilgrims having a smaller population.Despite the great educational and psychological aspects of the story we found it intolerably boring, complicated and complex. The writing was unnecessarily wordy, often times confusing us rather than conveying a story. We also found that there was a gratuitous amount of description throughout the story. Again, the extra and unneeded words often sidetracked us from the actual plot. The story line was full of unneeded fluff and pieces that did nothing to move the story along. We also were not fond of the frame narration literary style. It added further confusion to the plot and we did not see any particular benefits.Overall, we would not recommend Heart of Darkness to anyone looking for a light enjoyable read. For those looking for a story enriched with themes and new ways of seeing a society you thought you knew, then this may be the perfect book for you!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"A short novella describing the adventures of a crew aboard a French steamer on the Belgian Congo in Africa in the late nineteenth century, Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness weaves an intricate and at times, depressing tale of the inner struggle within humans. Like many of those who have posted before me, I believe that Heart of Darkness depicts the affects of the environment on one's psyche. The characters within the novella become corrupt and emotionally disturbed due to the nature of their surroundings. Africa, itself, is described as \\"barren\\" and \\"devoid of life.\\" The tone of the story as well as the descriptions of the setting are very bleak and mysterious. This \\"corrupt\\" African environment and the journey on the steamer affect the characters in various ways.Marlow, the protagonist of the novella, embarks on a life-changing and soul-searching journey when he steps aboard the steamer. On Marlow's trip through the Congo, he comes face to face with \\"the devil of rapacious and pitiless folly,\\" something of which he would never have come in contact with in his original land of England (Conrad 89). Marlow encounters many characters on his journey, none however as memorable or powerful as Kurtz. This is where the affect of environment becomes evident within the novella. Kurtz, a once dignified and regal ivory agent, falls victim to the atrocities aboard the steamer and in Africa. He is eternally scarred by the brutal experiences that occur during his time in Africa. Marlow comes from a modest and sheltered town in England. After being exposed to the experiences alongside Mr. Kurtz, Marlow ultimately ends his search for a soul, devoid of any true feeling. Because of their surroundings, Marlow and Kurtz both become damaged and meet similar fates.After some research on Conrad's personal history I came to understand why he portrayed Africa and the Congo in such a negative light. Because Conrad came from a predominantly white family and lived in predominantly white Europe, it is reasonable to believe that he viewed outsiders with somewhat racist tendencies. This only furthers the argument that Heart of Darkness shows the affect that a corrupt environment can have on its people. Much like today's society, a flawed and fraudulent government can have great emotional, political, and psychological effects on its citizens. Heart of Darkness does an accurate job of portraying dominant white ideologies of other races."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I chose this edition of Heart of Darkness for my Honors Senior English class because of the vocabulary and theme resources promised. While they are helpful, the format of the edition has caused problems, even for me. The volume itself is larger than the average book and each page is equivalent to at least 4 regular pages. The print is so small that it takes great concentration to keep focused. It is a challenge to read Conrad's dense prose in a typical edition, but this version makes it even more difficult."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"There is both a literal and a metaphorical heart of darkness here as man journeys from boring old England to the unknown Belgian Congo.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book is sometimes hard to get through because the prose is so thick. But I still enjoyed it. Honestly, I would recommend \\"Apocalypse Now\\" more as it's set in a more recognizable setting, but this book is still an interesting read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novella kept popping up on every list of \\"must read\\" books. It was short (around 100 pages), so I decided to give it a shot. I really didn't know what to expect, but I am so glad I decided to read this.The story told by Charles Marlow, who takes a position as a riverboat captain in Africa. The author, Joseph Conrad, had experience in the Belgian Congo, and it is supposed that he drew upon those experiences to write this novella. While in Africa, Marlow hears about the mysterious Kurtz - an ivory trapper who mans a station farthest up the river, and appears to have gone \\"rogue.\\" Eventually Marlow's assignment is to go up river to Kurtz's station, where he may chance to meet the man.Although the story is very simplistic, it's the writing that surrounds the story that draws one in. Joseph Conrad wrote this novella in the early part of the 20th century, and many modern day readers might be put off by the seeming \\"wordiness\\" of the book. However, the prose Mr. Conrad used is simply beautiful. Although I agree at times the author did get a bit long in his writing, the writing was so absolutely beautiful, I actually didn't mind. I simply loved reading the way he put his wording together, and the mood he created. He managed to create a entire scene in the jungle, and I felt as though I was there, back in the late 1800s.The novella's main subject is colonialism in all of its not so nice components. Mr. Conrad does an excellent job bringing to the reader how the native peoples are not treated as humans, how the colonists feel superior. In our modern, self-aware world of the 21st century, we have learned this lesson. Yet, I would imagine to the reading audience of the late 1800s or early 1900s, this novella might have been a bit more shocking.I did enjoy this novella, and far more than I was prepared to do so. Not only was I touched by the subject of the novella, but I truly enjoyed the beauty of the prose of the writing. I understand this is probably not a book for everyone, but that's what makes reading fun."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is a brilliant book that captures what can happen to man when he believes in his own power too much. As one who has traveled up the Congo River himself, I am amazed at Conrad's ability to capture a place so well."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book is more an expos&eacute; of dark and vile side of human nature than it is a history of the Belgian Congo. A river journey deep into Africa is just the setting for a story of human depravity, something we've seen over and over again, throughout history.Conrad takes a long hard philosophical look at the folly of greed and arrogance.He questions the morality of mankind. He points out that innocence is a facade, and that no man can truly be safe in a troubled world.At our most basic level we are all savage, civility a mere veneer that easily crumbles.The horror that Kurtz speaks of, is us, is our very nature. It has consumed him. It is a truth best hidden, locked away, not spoken of.In the end, Conrad throws out a bit of redemption for humanity, in the guise of Marlow's lie to Kurtz's fiancee to spare her from the horror of the truth.This novella packs a very powerful punch."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This was a short read but it contained some wonderful prose. The middle of the novel lagged a little bit but I was very pleasantly surprised by the ending which was superb."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It took me too long to read this book and Kipling's \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" but I finally did coincidentally finishing both within days of each other. So this review is somewhat influenced by my take on Kipling's yarn where two adventurers seek voluntarily to be sovereigns while the character of Kurtz is thrust into the role.I count the film, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" among my favorites which has only be reinforced having now read the source material. It did not disappoint, in fact, it offered more content, impact, and context. The build-up to meeting Kurtz was more nuanced and anticipatory than I expected owing to lines like \\"You can't judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man\\". And upon meeting him, it is clear his methods are \\"unsound\\" but given the environment and expectations perhaps they are ... understandable?And only because he was on the threshold of great things or because we recognize in Kurtz our own hearts of darkness when pushed to perform beyond our mental and physical abilities, we view him somewhat sympathetically. Conrad was telling us that we are all at our core savage but it is our role as reasoning beings to seek the \\"suppression of savage customs\\". This tale is all the more fantastic given the fact that Conrad himself experienced the Belgian Congo in 1890 adding to the credibility of this tale and imagined horrific accuracies."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"the product it is in a good use.I've used it for an university work and it is in a good condition and it is available for anybody who need it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This long novella is not an easy read. It starts as if in a Turner painting (the foggy Thames estuary) and ends in a Munchian cry (\\"The horror!The horror\\"). Apart from the classic parallel between the descent into the darkness of the jungle and the descent into the darkness of the human soul, what really hooked me was Conrad's prose: in no other book can you feel an atmosphere with such suffocating anguish, the hot and damp air of the surroundings, the pervading death, the total absence of light. I don't know if the book is a manifest against colonialism and some characterizations of the African natives as \\"savages\\" do appear dated in their archaic racism, but these are really minorand probaly irrelevant flaws in an otherwise major work of literature that ends in Kurtz's Nietzschean cry that seems to say that truth is lethal, which is why our lives are illusions."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Norton Anthologies are quickly becoming some of my favorite editions of classics. Most of the NCE are based around classics that are out of copyright, so they are easily accessible online in digital reader formats. What makes these most impressive is the collection of essays accompanying each central text. The information relating to Apocalypse Now and Pop Culture were integral in beginning my graduate research."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book, The Heart of Darkness was a very confusing, yet exciting story. The way my class went about reading the book was to first read a paragraph and then have the next person explain what that paragraph meant, which was very helpful. We then watched the film a few days later and critiqued it when it was over. Doing all of this with the class was a very good idea; it helped greatly in understanding the story and the book.My predictions on this story did not end up being correct. When we first began to read I thought that Kurtz would end up being a nice character that Marlow would be happy to meet, but that was not the case at all. Kurtz was an evil man who didn't care about anything but his ivory and money.The movie showed much more of Kurtz being evil than the book lead on. It also showed lots of gore and blood. This made me enjoy the movie much less than I would have, but in my opinion it was still much better than the book. In the movie they used the flashback technique a lot to help you understand what Marlow was thinking, which was also a reason for the movie being more enjoyable.Though the movie and the book had many differences, it also had many similarities. If I had the choice of recommending this book to anyone, I would not recommend the movie to anyone who is not interested in gore. I would also say that it is very necessary to read the book before watching the movie, to understand everything thoroughly. Although I did not understand the book as well as I would have hoped, after watching the movie, I did think that it was a very interesting story, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes odd but exciting stories."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Before I read Heart of Darkness I had expected that it would be an extreme challenge for me. I thought that it would be difficult to understand and that the symbolism that Joseph Conrad used would cause confusion of what his intentions really were, and as a result it would take a lot of time to understand.Throughout the book I was confused by the ironic themes and sarcastic tones used by Joseph Conrad to show hidden meanings deep within the Heart of Darkness. And from time to time my interpretation of certain sections of the book led me in the complete opposite direction of what Joseph Conrad had actually intended. Although, I struggled throughout the book I found Heart of Darkness to be a very deep and moving story about one man's struggle against the Congo, in a futile attempt to save a man, who in the end is exactly what he was fighting against. And while fighting external conflicts that he experiences throughout the entire book, he was also facing internal conflicts inside himself in an attempt to remain sane.Reading the Heart of Darkness, although it was challenging, benefited me considerably. It expanded my ability to read and understand a book in actuality and in any hidden meanings it may have. After reading the Heart of Darkness I would recommend it, but solely to people who have the ability read deep into a story and who plan to go through it slowly and reread many different parts until they have understood the book in its entirety. This book requires a lot of dedication, and if someone has it then this book will prove to be an enjoyable and educating experience."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness was never meant to be adapted into a movie. The book is far too complex to change. Though challenging, the book has much more to offer than the movie. It allows more room for the imagination to run. The underlying, hidden meaning behind every paragraph, and the turns it takes in a few pages is unimaginable. Few authors can pack so much meaning into a short book, such as this. In a way, Joseph Conrad's writing isn't the best reading material for high school sophomores, like myself, for we don't take the time to understand or pay close attention, but for those who do, Heart of Darkness is one book you should add to your list. I recommend this book for lovers of classic English literature and people interested in a quite challenging read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is an extremely difficult book to read. Joseph Conrad uses many obscure words to write his story in great detail. There are many examples of foreshadowing and symbolism in Heart of Darkness that normal readers would not pick up.I read Heart of Darkness with my tenth grade English class. We would read a paragraph and then explain it. The majority of my class could not explain it completely when it was their turn. My teacher frequently had to help the students explain the hidden meanings behind the words.Heart of Darkness is an extremely difficult book to read. It is also a very intriguing book if you can understand it. I would only recommend it to people who can understand literature very well. If you are a normal reader that wants to try to read this book, I would recommend reading it with someone that is at a high reading level or with a group, explaining it as you go."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Response to Heart of Darkness IntroductionAnd pgs. 195-212I am expect a very good book filled of new vocabulary, and a vast amount of new sentence structures that I have not read yet in that form. I think that I will enjoy this novel very much. I feel that I am ready for a new type of writing that will hold my attention. From what I have read so far I feel that this book will challenge me more than I have ever been challenged with any type of book. I feel that I will grow greatly from vocabulary to grammar, and a new way to view books. It will also get me ready for college, so that I can take on any book that will come my way. I predict that eventually Kurtz will die, which means the manager will be very happy. Someone will take over Kurtz's huge ivory empire and, Marlow will return to Europe very disappointed. I also predict that at the very end everyone in Africa in that is taking the ivory will realize that what they are doing is wrong and just drop their wealth and power and go home. So far the book has been everything I thought it would be. The vocabulary ranges broadly from simple Anglo Saxon words to a vast one. I really have learned new sentence structures along with the ones that I am learning now in class so I can make sense of the sentences.I was really shocked to find out that Kurtz was just like every other person in Africa too self-indulged to see the suffering and pain around him. However, who could blame him, his intensions were true from the beginning but the influence and power outweighed the good from the evil. In my opinion the ending to Heart of Darkness was typical. I felt this way because after you have read the entire book when Kurtz does die you think, \\"Wow, I can't believe Kurtz (the one with so much power) has actually died.\\" The way his wife responded in the movie was very shocking because she remained very poise, if I had known Marlow might have heard my last fianc&eacute;s words, and I had been in mourning for over a year I would have gone hysterical and asked him every single thing he could remember.I was expecting Kurtz to die because throughout the entire book almost all the characters were talking about the passing away of Kurtz, and how he was going to die so if he did not die then there wouldn't be a point to reading the book. I enjoyed this book, because not only did it open the door to new light on a broad range of vocabulary, but it wasn't the everyday norm. A normal book in my opinion is a novel that has the sentence structures set up in a way that makes the reader understand each page without having to discuss every sentence to make sense of what the novel is trying to explain. This book however, was arranged in a way that the grammar and sentence structures were distorted to make sense in a way that the mind still understood the meaning of every sentence. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in taking IB or college classes; it would also prepare them for challenging and tough books."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was exposed to Conrad when I took a course in Modern Fiction as an undergraduate, 20 years ago. I took the course as an elective to fill a lit requirement. It was one of the best courses I've ever taken, and of all the tremendous books that were assigned, this was my favorite. I have read this at least 1/2 dozen times in my life. I WAS glad, however, that I had a literary scholar walk through this one. I doubt I would have appreciated it as much had I not. I would therefore recommend the critical edition if you're reading this on your own. Modern Fiction - the literary period from circa 1900 to the mid-fifty's, is not everyone's cup of tea and can understand the negative reviews. The best of these works are dense, relative to today's standards but worthwhile - at least to me. Simply, they don't make'em like this anymore.After reading Heart of Darkness, take another look at Apocalypse Now, the best film adaptation of a novel - ever.Dark, hypnotic, surreal - Heart of Darkness stands alone as a unique classic of american literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When Kurtz exclaims &quot;The Horror! The Horror!\\" it is in the same sense that we would also cry out if suddenly faced with the unshielded countenance of God. At the threshold, just before we were either consumed, or absorbed, this too would be our cry.This most remarkable of books is a dissection of the Western psyche. We start with the capital city of the living dead in Europe itself. This is a land of sleepwalkers who have never awakened- they live out their lives spinning castles in the air that ultimately mean nothing. This is the state of the modern Western mind. Theory and profit, but no soul. On the journey down the African coast we encounter the European battleship antiseptically shelling the coast. These are transplanted westerners hiding in the shells of their technological terrors while lobbing shells into the outer world- without really being contaminated by it. Then we reach the coast, where the high ideals preached in Europe are more and more obviously abandoned the farther inland one travels. When the land and the natives become &quot;difficult&quot;, pure force and brutality are used to overcome and destroy.In other words, if they will not be &quot;westernized&quot;, turned into copies of us, they must be obliterated. Preferably while making us a profit.Kurtz was a strong man. He was ambitious and powerful. Perhaps he kept up the charade of &quot;civilizing&quot; the natives and the land in the name &quot;progress&quot; longer than anyone else. He kept up these empty lies until he penetrated to the deepest core of the primeval jungle. And then, this hollow shell of ideals and greed imploded. You see, as Conrad points out, Kurtz was fundamentally hollow. Yet Kurtz didn't just die, he was too strong. Instead, into that vacuum rushed the primal force itself. Kurtz became what he hated the most- he became the soul of the jungle- because he had none of his own. He became an &quot;animal&quot; in its highest sense, a totally natural man. Indeed he became a natural King, as the native tribes recognized. He and the land were truly one.It is a mistake to judge Kurtz by the standards of the city of the dead. Kurtz and his warriors sweeping across the jungle, taking heads and ivory as trophies, was as natural as lions running down gazelles.... Far more natural than the hypocritical, brutal, soulless, enslavement of the coastal natives in the name of &quot;civilization&quot;...."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad uses metaphor pretty much better than anyone ive ever read, his use of the english language would humble any scholar and he uses it here to show us the savage half of human nature. The character of Kurtz is a man who was considered brilliant by his 19th century contemporaries but when we encounter him, he is the primordial man in the place where all life began. Kurtz and this place(an ethereal vision of Africa revealed to us by the narrator Marlowe as he moves down the river toward Kurtz) seem to exist on another plane, before the advent of fear, faith, morality, hate, love and most importantly before the advent of lies. Kurtz sort of lives at one with nature, almost godlike in his understanding of its primal rhythms, yet at the same time his \\"civilized\\" self is horrorfied by nature's brutality. But it seems the savagery is preferable to the lies that are the foundation of western culture, because at least its honest, it isnt pretending to be something else. I tend to agree with the sentiment. The only thing negative thing about the novella is its dense with turn of the century references that are lost on me. However, even if you tend to prefer more modern authors like myself, I strongly recommend this powerful, savagely beautiful story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I just had a few brief comments. Conrad is one of the few novelists, such as Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Stern and Swift, whose work really impresses me. Partly this is because of the power and depth of his prose and his themes, and partly because English wasn't even his native language--he even learned it as an adult on shipboard. Heart of Darkness is one of his shortest, although greatest works in this sense, and after having read it in high school, I recently reacquainted myself with it after 30 years. I was just as impressed as I was back then. Truly a great book by one of history's greatest authors."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is the story that inspired apocalypse now yet it tells it in a far more diverse fashion. You really are plunged into Marlow's thoughts about the consiquences of colinization and the legacy of it. Marlow sets sail down the congo river and discovers himself by exploring the dark world of the natives and their invaders who take advantage of their naiviety. So beautifully written with prose that leave you breathless."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is the horrific tale of Marlow, a British seaman who traveled to Africa for the Company, but narrowly escaped death. On the distant foreign continent, the division between white men and the natives was acute. Even in the blistering heat, some of the transplanted Englishmen sternly clung to their civilized ways, sporting pristine white long sleeved shirts and elaborately tied ties, while the natives peered from the thick undergrowth with startlingly white eyes.Here, the jungle was so green, it was almost black. The heat and danger were oppressive and the needs of the colonists woefully misunderstood back in England. Often, the Company showered them with copper wire and cheap beads meant to impress the natives, when what they really needed was rivets to patch up a leaky steamboat.The power struggle within the Company left Marlow out of touch and forgotten in the vast wilderness. Suddenly, he realized just how alone he truly was.In time, Marlow came to meet Kurtz, the mysterious agent with supposedly supernatural powers. Kurtz was a \\"wizard\\" of sorts. He dealt with the African natives with effortless ease, seemingly as at home in the bush as in a London parlor. Yet, when Marlow found Kurtz, he was very ill, a prisoner among the natives, a captive of the circumstances and the life he'd been forced to endure.How many of us walk a similar road in our lives? How thin are the trappings of civilization and how fragile life is! For those of us who realize our frailty comes the truth of self-knowledge and a rare wisdom worthy of the ages."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad had to learn English and struggled mightily to get the right words. The result is superb. There is a rhythm and tone to his writing that creates an atmosphere which is an inspiration to me, as an author. It's a style worthy of emulation and carries the sweep and breadth of the vast ocean. Conrad was at sea only a couple of years, but they made a lifelong impression on him and he conveys an almost mystical effect in his story telling. One can just see the old seamen sitting around a table with drinks and cigars reminiscing about adventures and drama.

I didn't get into right away and a somewhat negative view of it. Years later, I picked it up again and my view was completely different. It is written with an elaborate care for wording which seems to have been largely lost to the world in the last half a century or so. This is a must for anyone with an appreciation of good writing. And if you're a writer, even if (or especially if) you're own style and tastes are completely different, you should at least expose yourself to this book (along with other greats of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; I would highly recommend Stephen Crane as well)."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This review is concerned with the Norton Critical Edition, second edition, of Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS. The current Norton edition is the fourth edition.The decision to rate this edition at five stars, despite my disappointment with the additional commentary, which is supposed to set the Norton Critical Editions apart from other editions, is that regardless of supplemental material, the reader will still be getting Conrad's masterpiece. I do not especially recommend this edition - seldom have I read so many discussions pertaining to a work of literature I was especially moved by, which, to me, entirely miss the very points with which I was so intrigued. I think this was heightened due to the severity of the story's impression on me - I was hoping to read in the following essays cogent points that addressed my reactions, which I did not.I don't know if it benefits anyone much to review HEART OF DARKNESS at this point - perhaps the best that I can manage for this venue is to say that this is the second time I've read HoD: The first time, I was completely unimpressed, the second, completely blown away. That suggests to me that I needed to enlarge myself before it could resonate. I thought that, in one of the few interesting essays following the story, critic Seymour Cross provided a reasonable parallel to my feelings. There he discusses the four men who listen to Marlow's tale of his journey up the Congo: the three essentially silent listeners, and then the actual narrator of the story, who chronicles Marlow as he retells his experience. Of these, one might assume the silent are distinctly unimpressed with Marlow's yarn - it simply passes the time. Yet the chronicler, while initially as dismissive as the others, is uniquely affected, to the point that he is, with Marlow as a surrogate, able to make a moral journey of his own.This particular point of view doesn't have to be right, but it is useful when I think of how I received the story on the two occasions I've read it: first, dismissive also, but the second, felt that the story set up a string of echoes that left me intensely interested in questions about art and literature, and about the nature of man. I realize those are grandiloquent ideas - I also think HEART OF DARKNESS is one of those few works of literature that plumb those depths.Since, based on my own readings, I now feel that the effect's of Marlow's journey toward the enigmatic Kurtz - and what he finds about himself there - is dependent on each reader's unique responsiveness, I can't see much benefit in a long list of superlatives in order to recommend it. It will be a classic and on reading lists with or without my help. I would suggest that if, on the first reading, one isn't impressed, then the passage of time might yield an entirely different experience should one pick it up again. Also, whether or not this made any difference I'm not sure, but this is another one of the books that I read aloud to my fiancee. Reading and listening to the rhythm of Conrad's words was a benefit - I never felt the prose difficult or obtuse, as I have in other books by Conrad that I've read. In fact, HEART OF DARKNESS has only made me interested in seeking out other works of his.One last note about editions - as I mentioned, I felt the supplemental commentary to this edition was subpar, yet I do think it amply illustrates a particular example of mid-century criticism, along with its faults. I am looking forward to reading the supplemental commentary to the current edition, the fourth, for a comparison and contrast. According to the Norton website, the fourth edition contains essays by Chinua Achebe and Eward Said, suggesting to my mind a further shift from what I think is most important about HoD to the distracting topics of Colonialism and colonial writers. It isn't that I don't think those subjects have their place - but it may be a case of missing the forest in order to concentrate on one of its trees. Still, as I haven't read them, those are assumptions on my part, and I do think it will be interesting to read their take on Conrad."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Absolutely terrifying.

I read it because I took a class in Literary Theory and this was the book we had to read for a large essay. But I'm glad I did.First of all, this is not a long read. It is not a long novel. The books I had seen in stores about it were thick but most of them had additional essays and such in them. The actual Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is a short read that anyone who likes to read can get through relatively quickly.Second, this book is not like any of the contemporary books. If you are looking for a pleasure read, this might not be one to choose. It is a deep book about Africa after Europeans, mainly British, have taken over large parts and subjugated the natives. Through the eyes of a British man, the reader sees how strange and exotic the land and its people are. The reader sees how Europeans can never really see it as home or fit it. The treatment of the natives is very revealing of the natures of all humans involved.I wrote the paper on postcolonial theory and this was the perfect book for that paper. One thing I noted was how the main subject of the book might be stated to be the narrator, but the truth is the subject of the book is the heart of the native. Though rarely mentioned, it drives the story and is the entire foundation of it.If you love classics, literature, and history, this might be a book to check out. It would make a great addition to a book club were various topics can be discussed. Trust me, this book has a lot to keep any discussion group going."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"A masterpiece about the greed of human nature and folly of men pursuing wealth and power at the cost of their sanity, and of their lives. The writing is disorganized, chaotic, crazy even, but that is exactly the kind of situation Conrad was trying to convey. If you get lost while reading, don't worry, you are supposed to! The Belgian occupation of the Congo was probably the cruellest of all colonial powers, at least as long as King Leopold was running the place as his personal fiefdom.

Even Africans often considered an African life worth next to nothing."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"Heart of Darkness (1902)\\", Joseph's Conrad's famous novella can be read on two levels: as an adventure story set in an exotic, treacherous land (the story takes place in the Congo) or as a symbolic account of the insatiable greed behind Western Imperialism / Colonialism.One of the central conflicts--apart from the protagonist's inner journey into the 'heart of darkness'--is the question of whether the Europeans are morally superior to that of the 'savages' encountered along the banks of the Congo river.Even though many--including writer Chinua Achebe (author of \\"Things Fall Apart\\")--has criticized the novel for its inferior depiction of Africans, the answer to the question is clearly palpable in a scene where the steamboat heading upstream on the Congo river is bogged midstream due to fog: the protagonist, Charles Marlow, realizes that the 'woodcutters' or natives working for him haven't eaten in weeks; to makes things more complicated, they are cannibals...Thus the quandary arises in Marlow's mind: what's to stop them from eating us? Certainly, the natives have them outnumbered on the boat, and they could easily satisfy their cannibalistic urges with impunity. But, much to the bewilderment of the protagonist, they do not seem to be considering this option; instead he realizes that even in the face of something as cataclysmic as hunger, the natives have 'restraint'--which is clearly a superior mental attribute, quite contrary to the greedy mindset of the ivory-obsessed Europeans.Hence 'Civilization' is a relative term, even the British would've seemed barbarous to invading Romans--as Marlow explains in the beginning; and at one time, just as the darkest corners of unexplored Africa, the country laying claim to Thames--before it became the apex of civilization--was 'one of the dark places of the earth' too."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is a short book, but sometimes it can be difficult to read. It contains a lot of symbolism and is written in colonial era English. Regardless, I personally think it is a great book, which dwells into the evils of imperialism in Africa. I think to fully enjoy the power of this book it is be good idea to first read a little about the Congo Free State and King Leopold II of Belgium. Just a quick introductory reading in Wikipedia. This is one of the darkest episodes of European imperialism, and with that context clear, its a lot easier to understand and enjoy Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel is truly a must-read classic. Conrad's insight and writing skills vividly portray the world of Marlow and of Kurtz. Read through the Post-colonialism filter, Conrad's depiction of Africa during the era of Imperialism bring to light the inherent flaws that he finds in civilization. Through Marlow's story, we catch a memorable glimpse inside the Continent when it was the entrance to the unknown, the vast darkness.About the Dover Thrift Edition itself, it's definitely at a very good price.

The baggage-free reader of \\"Heart of Darkness\\" will find that Conrad used a lot of vague allegory and symbolism that lent a haunting and disturbing feel to the story. But Conrad's symbolism is sometimes so diffuse that a cynical reader may find that the English professors are seeing what they want to see, and that the story might be a little too short and stunted to truly inspire a century of over-analytical aggrandizement. Conrad was surely commenting on the dangers faced by European colonialists in Africa and their tendencies toward cruelty and megalomania. But since he focused more on the travails faced by Marlow the boatman rather than Kurtz the mad colonial demagogue, the reader may be annoyed at both Conrad for leaving many loose ends, and at the interpreters for making vast claims about groundbreaking commentary on history and European society. If you're suspicious of academic interpretations, you'll probably find that this story, while certainly delivering some haunting lessons, may not have accomplished everything you've heard about.

Wait--I take it back--not \\"awful\\"...but certainly...ponderous. Prolix. Demanding and uncompromising--in a way which is not really warranted, not perhaps necessary, but the author's prerogative nonetheless.If you throw it away after a couple pages, I understand. However, unlike Henry James's The Turn of the Screw--which is gussied-up, ain't-I-a-weighty-writer? crap--Heart of Darkness is a true masterwork, and if you GET THROUGH IT, you'll come across some excellent stuff.And at only seventy-two pages, you should manage.Conrad, despite his unconcern for his readers' patience, DOES know how to create a classic character. Kurtz is such a one...and the suspense that builds over the course of the narrative makes the reader anticipate greatly his introduction. You're also left wanting more (and, when it's all over, feeling a bit short-changed), an attribute shared by other all-time classic figures such as Sherlock Holmes, Jeeves the butler, and Hannibal Lecter (before Thomas Harris sold him down the river).The MLA claims that Heart of Darkness is the sixty-seventh best novel(la) of the 20th century (despite its complete and total 19th century tone, style, and atmosphere), and I'll go along with that. It's a much more significant contribution to literature than an impostor-work such as On the Road (ranked #55), but it may, however, suffer in the rankings due to its brevity.My advice: drink some Mountain Dew, hunker down for a couple hours, and get this book under the belt."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If one is seeking answers to the question why things must always go wrong, one must read this book.

I would encourage the reader to endeavor to look into what there is beyond the story, not in what is being said, but what is not being said, and why. The answer is at the other end of your own mind. As for the Everyman's edition and Klinkenborg's introduction - just perfect!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The 18th century, and more so the 19th Century, was the era of the great African explorer. Names such as Bruce, Burton, Livingston, and Stanley were famous in their day.Conrad has created a short novel or novella to explore and describe one such fictional incident on the rivers of Africa. Conrad's central theme is that the European explorers were exploiting the natives and bring a moral darkness to the continent, i.e.: they were not encountering an African darkness, but rather they were bringing a moral darkness into the continent.In terms of the overall story, this is the tale of one man sent on a rather mundane trip up an African river to make contact with a company manager who was working on his own. The errant manager is accumulating ivory and other things of economic value. The story describes the challenges of the trip and the primitive living conditions.Of course, Conrad's writing is superb. It is the benchmark river story that was followed by many later authors, novels, and movies. This is good but very short read; it is really a novella."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"To shortly summarize, \\"Heart Of Darkness\\", by Joseph Conrad, is all about an English man named Marlow. He's a sailor and an explorer who takes command of a steamboat on an African river, during the Age of Imperialism. He takes his ship up the river in hopes of finding a man named Kurtz, who's something of a legend among the Englishmen living in Africa. What he finds along his journey causes him the question the morality of Imperialism, and he finds in the African natives something which resembles evil. And once he finds Kurtz, he realizes that, although the Imperialists may act superior and tough, they are just as savage and immoral as the natives.\\"Heart Of Darkness\\" is a real page turner. It may be short, but I finished it in 4 days (which is fast for me). Marlow is a generally likeable character, and easy to relate to. Kurtz, however, provides the enigma. Conrad's story is excellent, but some characters, Kurtz included, could have used more development. Thus, Kurtz remains something of a mystery to the reader. How he got to be the way he is is never explained. But my, what figure he is... he cuts off the heads of natives and shoves them on posts outside his house. He's a savage man who has a special way with the natives, which is what makes him legendary. But when Marlow gets to him, Kurtz is ill, and his final days appear to be on the horizon.The mood of this book is extremely bleak, and overall it is depressing. But by the same token, it makes the reader question the moral values of men, and whether those in a position of power have the right to rule over those who are inferior. Marlow really questions this, and in the end, comes to the conclusion that such things are wrong. Personally, I like dark books such as this one, so I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's besetting literary sin was always prolixity. Despite his occasionally brilliant descriptive passages and his ability to pick just the right uncommon word when he needed it, he rarely bothered to compress his writing. So it oftentimes sprawls.This shapelessness is the most serious problem with Heart of Darkness. The paragraphs go on forever. The man who tells the story of his journey - Marlow - is criticized by the primary narrator for his many \\"inconclusive\\" tales, so Conrad may well have cultivated his seemingly rambling style just to emphasize how difficult it is for Marlow's listeners to understand the point. If so, I believe that choice was a mistake.Much in the story is excessively subtle and allusive. Yet Conrad's deep pessimism about human progress and the human \\"spirit\\" is unmistakable. The story's secondary theme, that most people \\"just can't handle the truth\\" (to quote a Jack Nicholson movie), comes through loud and clear.Heart of Darkness is a classic more for what it says than how it says it. What's more, we're far more receptive to Conrad's message today than was the reading public in 1899. The tale's current fame owes a great deal to Apocalypse Now, but readers looking for an adventure novel will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book will take you on a journey and as you go deeper into the jungle you fall deeper into the dept of mans corruptibility. This book is brutal and honest. Marlow is the type of good man that does nothing and his goal is the type of man that has fallen from everything. Marlow ends up seeing the very essence of the darkness of men. You realize that he too could be corrupted just as easily by this evil that has stolen his targets soul. I too felt that I could be corrupted by the same evil if I was in their place. That is the scariest thing of all. I felt disgustingly empowered by this book and by the end I had chills down my spine at the absurdity of that perceived power and the great cost it took on all the innocents around it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness was a pretty good book. The wording may be little difficult for some to understand, but most will get it. Futility is a constant reoccurring theme. The main story is actually a man recounting his past. It may be confusing at times whether you are in the present or past. This and the lack of breaking the story in to chapters are the only draw backs. The rich plot line and dynamic characters are greatly portrayed by the author, Joseph Conrad.The movie Heart of darkness is was a disappointment after reading the book. Aside from being a horrendous piece of film work, it changed many key confrontations and plot points from the book. The events leading up to the ending were changed/erased.I would suggest to not even bothering contemplating whether or not to watch the film and save yourself some time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If I had to choose between reading the book Heart of Darkness and jumping off a ledge into a pit of very hungry caterpillars, I would definitely choose the latter option. However, if the choice was between reading the book and watching the movie, I would pick the second alternative. The novel Heart of Darkness was more put together than the film, and the sequences made more sense to the reader. In the movie, the random flashbacks that may have seemed artistic to the director really just caused the viewer massive confusion. If I hadn't read the book, the movie would have made even less sense, and I would have spaced out even earlier than I did. Watching the film was a complete and utter waste of time. After all, watching a movie that almost entirely differs from the story it was based on seems pointless, because it just makes it hard to distinguish the facts that change from one source to the other.I appreciate the novel, and I feel like it was really well-written. Joseph Conrad's subtle mocking of the hypocrisies of his time period added a bit of humor and mystery to the story, but it was still a little less action-packed than I would have preferred it to be. The pages and pages of intense descriptions of the characters, settings, and any other random pieces of information seemed unnecessary. It just drew out a story that could have been finished in about a third of the space. In short, while many benefited from and were inspired by the works of Joseph Conrad, the world would have been a happier place without the making of the film Of Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is a first person portrayal of the hypocritical and futile rule of Europe over the Congo and its ivory trade.

Overall some of the best literature I've ever seen.The T.V. movie is a horse of a different colour mostly because of the rushed sense, turning a story of beautifully intricate chaos, and conspiracy into a spot of bad luck.I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie so you can be properly disappointed by its lack of artistry, and once you've finished that affair watch Apocalypse Now!

This is a book with layers upon layers, but to even grasp the surface story of a voyage into Africa would require a certain level of intelligence. This novella is an amazing piece of literature that has been adapted countless times into other pieces of work. For this reason alone I recommend the book to be read by anyone with an interest in literature. But head this warning, this book is very complex, if you feel as if you still wish to read it then I encourage you. If I was to call this book a \\"thinking\\" book it would be a dastardly understatement. If you truly allow yourself to become immersed into the book you will find yourself in the scary place of the entrails of human emotions. This book shows humans to be simply animals hidden underneath a shroud of civility. Only when we remove that shroud are we truly the monsters humans are. This book allows insight and literary utopia if you can decipher it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Numb. That is the feeling I had after viewing the film, Heart of Darkness. After reading the novel I viewed the Darkness of Africa as an exciting adventure. The graphic images in the movie awoke my mind to the blatant truth. This story isn't just a little man tra la la-ing down a mysterious river smiling and having an exciting adventure as he goes down this roller coaster of fantasy. His experiences are real. Real life. That's what's so scary about this story. It shows man for what he really is, evil.Throughout the novel Conrad sheds Christianity and religion in general, in a futile and hypocritical light. The European imperialists say they are \\"Christianizing\\" the continent when really they are squeezing Africa and its people for what they are worth. Yet many of Conrad's main points reflect the building blocks of Christianity. For example, man's sin nature. The images that the film projects enhances the evil of Kurtz. In the book he doesn't seem as evil...as horrible. When Marlow is narrating the story in the novel he says that Kurtz realizes something about himself \\"The Horror.\\" It takes an untamed wilderness for Kurtz to realize this \\"horror,\\" this evil in himself, his sin nature.Conrad emphasizes that those with no religious strength or moral convictions are the ones that are conquered by Darkness, evil, and corruption. Christians, like Conrad, have recognized this. This is why they strive to keep within strict moral guidelines and follow the Bible, God's Word. They follow God's Word alone because He is the only One who can not be corrupted by the darkness found deep within man's soul, sin."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It is remarkable that one of our greatest books in the English language is written by someone whose first language was not English (and written in such a gorgeous, ambiguous style). This is one of my favorites, in a way, because its theme is so straight forward and yet so hard to grasp. Much has been written about this book and many film versions have been made. My take on it is that it is kind of an ironic and absurd voyage that takes place. Marlow plunges into this darkness with such fervor only to find something at the other end which makes the whole voyage seem like it was all in vain - just as Kurtz attempts at a successful love-life came to the same disapointing end. So Kurtz simplifies his existence to its basic human form - and only begins to accentuate the worst trait of humanity - greed. It is almost like Thomas Hobbes' vision of humanity - something completely vile. Our only hope in the end is Marlow - what does he learn from this - food for thought."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is a terrifying tale of corruption, greed, and evil. The story is narrated through the character Marlow, and begins as Marlow recounts his horrific adventure to his shipmates.Marlow works for a Belgium trading company whose primary interest is ivory. As Marlow continues his job he quickly learns the shady intentions of the Company and he describes in detail the sinister practices used to acquire ivory. One man in particular has become completely engulfed in greed and obsession. His name is Kurtz, and it is Marlow's job to remove Kurtz because his conduct has become too extreme and his practices could taint the Company's reputation. During Marlow's shocking quest he becomes educated on the dark side of mankind.The Heart of Darkness is a fascinating nightmare. Imagery overflows as Conrad vividly describes the Europeans' sick trading practices and their excessive greed. Heart of Darkness is a well-written book, though it is extremely fast paced and sometimes hard to follow. Despite the intriguing storyline, it is often difficult to understand exactly what is happening. However, the book certainly should not be disregarded.

Four men sit aboard ship on the Thames waiting for the tide to go out and their journey to begin. While waiting, Marlow seated cross legged against the mizzenmast begins his tale his journey into the heart of darkness, &quot;And this also has been one of the dark places on earth.&quot; As he continues his tale by saying that &quot;The conquest of the earth...is not a pretty thing when you look at it too much.As a young man Marlow was intrigued by the dark spaces on maps representing the unexplored interiors of continents. With the help of an aunt he was assigned a ship to captain on the great river of Africa. While sailing along the African coast he felt drawn to the dark interior. Arriving at the station he meets the manager and learns from him of a manager up river named Kurtz who is able to extract amazing amounts of ivory from the heart of the continent. Marlow's task will be to repair his damaged ship and voyage up river to Kurtz's station.Conrad makes the excursion up river arduous. It is oppressive and difficult to reach the very core of the continent. The river is dark and gloomy, hanging with vines shrouded in fog. On the shores there are great dangers, with the boat representing a safe sanctuary in a dangerous and heathen existence. With Conrad's style the reader struggles up river with Marlow to get to Kurtz and the heart of the darkness. While traveling there, the reader is drawn to it and hypnotized.The journey to find the horror at the shadowed center of the soul is a difficult one indeed. Travel with Marlow to find if there is redemption to be found for those who chose to voyage there."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's novella, &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; certainly includes some of the most complex symbolism of works written in the English language; despite its relative brevity, the story works on multiple levels and addresses countless themes. Yet no one seems to be able to agree on precisely what those themes are, nor whether or not Conrad was successful at conveying them.Occasionally one will hear a reader comment, &quot;I just didn't get it.&quot; True - and perfectly legitimate. Almost no one understands &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; on the first read; but the advantage of its short length is that the reader can quite easily sit down and finish the book in about 3 hours of dedicated reading. Which means, the novella is much more accessible than one feels upon first read.But even reading on one's own is insufficient for literature of this caliber; as with all great stories, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is full of themes and ideas that are so broad in scope, that it is entirely necessary to discuss them with others who have read the work as well. Literature is not meant to lie on the page, inert, and Conrad's story is a prime example of this fact. It is only in discussion that one can truly delve into the mysteries of &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;The symbolism and color of this novella are elusive, true - but not incomprehensible. It is to the reader's benefit to purchase two copies of this story; one to remain unmarked, a clean copy, and one to write all over and highlight. (For this second copy, most readers will be delighted by the Norton Critical edition of the book, which not only includes the entire text, and cut lines from the manuscript, but hundreds of pages of essays and criticism which is most helpful.)Though this book appears, on the surface, to be nearly insurmountable, discussion and multiple readings will reveal an immense artistry which is both haunting and beautiful; Conrad's themes are entirely relevant today as we go about our lives. A question to consider while reading the novella - if there were no consequences, if society did not exert restraint, then how would I act? What would I do differently? What would I become?The reality might just be a bit dimmer than the reader had given pause to discover."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Not so hot; phony intellectuals are told this is a great work so they make up all sorts of lies about layering and craftsmanship, when it's really just a so-so story and the ending with the guy Marlon Brandon played in the movie (Apocalypse Now) going crazy and Conrad never explaining why there should be such a fascination with him. It might be a nice book if there was a story here. But these modern phonies do not understand that writing is supposed to be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"By now in my life of reading, I've come to accept that many of the world's &quot;great works of fiction&quot; are more concerned with carefully examining some moral concept than telling a story and making a point. Heart of Darkess is just such a work. As Verlyn Klinkenborg says in his introduction, &quot;physical and moral suffering is the very substance of this book.&quot; There is no point being made directly... Only obliquely, I suppose, the point is: morality is ambiguous.Charlie Marlow, the narrator and principal actor in the tale, tells us of his riverborne journey into the depths of some remote African wilderness. A journey into the &quot;heart of darkness.&quot; A dark place it is, too. His purpose is to come face-to-face with a man named Kurtz, who has gone into the darkness as something of a prodigal newcomer, but has become enveloped and blackened by the savage wilderness he came to tame.If I can divine any direct purpose, it's to examine the moral edge between civilization and savagery. The two realms are so inherently contradictory, that the forces pushing against the edges are likely to be stronger than almost any man. Even great men. The most 'remarkable man' in the tale is Kurtz, and he is clearly weaker than these edge forces. They contort him into something of an &uuml;ber-savage, while his civilized soul recognizes the abomination of it all. His dying words sum it up: &quot;the horror, the horror.&quot;My personal trouble with the novel is that it only goes so far as to examine, but never resolve. In Klinkenborg's words, &quot;Heart of Darkness presents you with a series of moral conundrums which continue to feel like conundrums even after you've finished the book. It's greatness...lies in the torturous irresolution...of the moral dilemmas raised one after another... That irresolution is the essense of Conrad's artistic vision. 'The only legitimate basis of creative work', he exmplained in a letter... 'lies in the courageous recognition of all the irreconcilable antagonisms that make our life so engimatic, so burdensome, so fascinating, so dangerous, so full of hope.'&quot;In the end, Conrad is taking the nihilistic position that there is no resolution. No answers, only conundrums. He has done a very good job of breathing life into this position, and constructing a world where there is no ground for moral truths. For the purpose of seeing this view, the tale is worth reading. As a guide to charting one's own morality, Heart of Darkness is lazy at best, and insidiously corrupt at worst."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This masterpiece, far from being a racist text, shows much more strongly the limits of Kurtz than it highlights his no doubt initially sincere interest in making the underdeveloped world of his day safe for modernity and enlightenment.

When asked what Kurtz has done to inspire such devotion, the young clown remarks that Kurtz had discoursed supremely and unforgettably to the young on the topic of \\"Love.\\" Cultural resonance should call to mind both Socrates and Jesus, who chose the same topic but were, with greater consistency than Kurtz, themselves put to death rather than being the cause of the death of others on the principle of \\"Exterminate the Brutes.\\" Conrad, I suggest, is here showing decline in his picture of the 19th Century's new man, embodied in the fine-spoken but ultimately tragic, because finally spiritually barbaric, Kurtz."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I only read this because someone else was telling me it was one of the favorite books and it was so hard to get through!

Surely, I agree, that books is not going to be liked by everybody, since, the narrative is extremely dense and descriptive. If you enjoy dialogs, fast action, clarity and simplicity of language... avoid this reading.This novella though, cannot be taken out of the historical context. In times, when non of the mass media tech devices existed, as well as geographic magazines with colorful photographs, authors were much more obliged to use the art of the language. That was done in order to lead the readers' imaginary, into the settings and backgrounds of the novels, as well as to illustrate personal characters and thoughts.That's why old literature is so full of descriptions, which might annoy modern generation, used to the visual effect in mass media.I would definitely call Joseph Conrad's narrative, poetic.... Poetic with rich metaphors, charged with dense emotions and psychological deepness as well as the beauty of the certain narrative rhythm, which stays in harmony with the flow of the waters in Congo River. Some previous reviewer compared HoD to the musical symphony. I must say, I totally agree. If you let your imagination blossom, triggered by the writer's prose, you can feel the sounds of deep, classical, booming, romantic music, see the deepest darkness of the jungle with all colorful, powerful details.I cannot say that the subject of colonial Africa with its greediness for ivory treasures, violence and social inequality interests me too much, but the beauty of language in this book is simply mesmerizing.Darkness, darkness of the cruel nature as well as darkness of human evil is the story theme, which Conrad personally experienced, during his travels to that geographical zone.He single-handedly had seen the cruelty and corruption of power. He had seen what happened to the territorial lords, which morality was twisted by greed and pride, lack of respect for other human beings, lack of faith in anything besides themselves. And yet, he was more observant than judgmental in his depictions. Demons of greed still exist, so for that reason this book is timeless and can be a moral warning to the present and future generations."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Secret Sharer (1912)byJoesph ConradThe story begins in the Gulf of Siam on a ship commanded by a captain who is new to the ship andto the ship's crew.

The story is not happening at the moment, for example; TheSkipper, from The Sephora, gave his name, the narrator said, \\" it was something like Archbold - butat this distance of years I hardly am sure\\". The new captain feels out of place. He thinks his crewdoesn't respect, and he feels like a stranger on his vessel. On his first night out on the decks, keepingwatch for a sign of wind to carry the ship out into the sea. The Captain spots a rope ladder, knowing heshould've told his underlings to prep the ship before turning in, he recognizes his mistake, and tries topull the rope ladder out from the water and onto the deck. The captain, to his astonishment, feels theheaviness of the rope ladder that should not be there.

Leggattwas locked away in a cabin for some weeks and escaped to a islet. From there Leggatt took off all ofhis clothes strapped a stone to them and threw them into the the water to try and convince his crew thathe drowned in the sea either by exhaustion or suicide and to stop searching for him. Leggatt told histale to the narrator , who immediately believed his story and not only identify with him but he couldnot believe that they both look a like and went to the same school , \\"Conway\\".Leggatt was more confident in himself and I think the narrator wished he was more like Leggatt orwere they the same person? The captain's room is shaped like a capital L, like Leggatt.

Had i read it 40-50 years ago it might have made a more favorable impression. I've heard the story many times before and I'm sure I'll hear it again in the future."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book camethe next day. Very quick thank you. I will definitely order again. Thank You for your prompt attention on my order."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of DarknessReading the first pages was a pleasure, surely I was reading art. But like a lot of things, my first impression was faulty and the writing style ground to a drudge.The story is a simple one; a sailor who can't find employment must accept one far off in Africa. His attitude towards Africans was the attitude of the white world. His attitude towards the business of ivory was that of the \\"company\\".I don't believe the author intended any great statement of humanity. I think he just thought it was a good story. Huckleberry and Tom's use of the \\"N\\" word is nothing to the uses of human slanders in this book.I will not read this book again. It would be instructive for people who are interested in the truth of how the white race discounted the black race and abused them.This was a Kindle book which I received free. Gotta love it!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Books on African history don't really do justice in describing what colonial Africa was like and the European trade that dominated the continent. In reading \\" The Heart of Darkness\\", Joseph Conrad takes one away to Africa 200 years ago when Europe domination of the continent caused so many problems. Told as a first person narrative, the character reminisces and tells others on his boat on the Thames of his days in Africa on the Congo river in a steamboat set out for trading. The whole story is told by the character Marlow and his experiences. When the story takes you away , one really gets an idea of what it would have been like as a European in Africa in the \\"heart of darkness\\". The story is filled with so much imagery that it really paints a picture for one to see what Marlow's life in Africa was like. Conrad's story is well written for the most part and has a certain \\"dark\\" mood to it, really touching on one's emotions to some degree. This book is very good and so descriptive and although it is short, a lot of longer books don't nearly have as much as description or imagery that Conrad put in this particular book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness Book Review\\"THE HORROR-THE HORROR!\\", those are some of the most bone chilling words of the book Heart of Darkness that Joseph Conrad has so eloquently painted. This is one of the most mortifying tales of the destruction of the crippled, and once colonized country of Congo, and more directly on the Amazon river.Conrad writes the story of Marlow's(the narrator/ main character) trip down the Amazon River in search for the god like Mr. Kurtz. Along the way he witness's a shocking display of racism, hatred, death, sickness, the slow pace of productiveness by an economically devastated nation, and even has his own near death experience. Along the way you see how Marlow changes from a proper English gentleman, with a racist tone of voice, into a scared, feeble, euphoric man waiting for his turn to be consumed by the darkness of the Amazon rivers mysterious eerie, death-like aura.Finally nearing the end of the novel everything seems to make sense. The godlike Mr. Kurtz, a man glorified by every person Marlow meets, faces the Ivory Mogul's eerie demise. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in human psychology, the movie Apocalypse Now!, and/or the mysteries of the sea. The text can at times be difficult to decipher, but do not be discouraged by this, keep reading and it will make sense as you go."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I believe that this is a message not a book, a statement not a story. In it Conrad says what he thinks about the world. Its corruption, mutilation, and destruction of itself. This message is planted under the story of a man's voyage down an African River to save another human. If you want to know the message of this book just look at Kurtz. Kurtz is everything that this story is about. He is futility because of Marlow's futile attempt to save him. He is corruption when he changes from an emissary of light to the pure evil that the Darkness and Europe have made him. If you follow his progression during this book, you will see what Conrad believes happens in the real world. By reading and understanding the deeper meanings that lie far beneath the familiar story line and reside in the subliminal hints that Conrad leaves for us, we see that he believes that in the end everything good in this world will be corrupted. He believes that the Darkness, which I believe he means to be this society in which we live, can over power the noblest aspects of man kind. To Conrad everything is futile, no matter how much you care things won't workout.This book was a direct assault on the imperialistic views of Europe of that time. Conrad points out its cruelness, its inefficiency and its darkness. Marlow, who is Conrad's alter ego, has respect of the natives, and sees them as people. Where as the Manager and the Pilgrims though of them as inhuman and treated them as such. Obviously the Manager and the Pilgrims represent Europe and how it feels about people who are different. Just like Kurtz, Marlow wants to change this, he wants to treat them better and so does Conrad. That is why he wrote this book, to show the wrongs of Imperialism and how it can be changed.I believe that the thing that we learn most from this book is that things are not always as they appear. Allot of the phrases and words that Conrad uses can have many meanings and each meaning can change the story and what he is trying to say. We also learn of the wrongs of imperialism and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. This book gives us a deeper insight to life and its many paths, of which we can chose to follow."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is what I wrote at different intervals of Heart of Darknes for my English 10 class:Heart of Darkness proves to be a challenging book, because it will be difficult to determine the meaning of parts of the book. To tell the truth, this book looks utterly boring and exhausting to read. I'm only dreading examining and re-examining it to find symbols which I need to write the inevitable batch of essays.Now that we've begun Heart of Darkness, some of my expectations have already come to pass. The book is challenging, and there are few parts of the book that are vivid and straight forward. We have also examined the book for symbolism, which can be found in just about every sentence. Marlow (a character based on author Joseph Conrad) travels to Africa for business, and sees some truly horrific things. His writing of the slaves who go to die under the shade is disturbing and vivid. The rest of the book will probably be Marlow's working in Africa, and how he finally leaves the heart of darkness.Two-thirds into Heart of Darkness, the pace of the book has picked up and it's easier to the read the book. Once you're used to the writing style, you can respect the complexity and beauty of his writing. My expectations were wrong. Heart of Darkness, while still not easy to read, is more interesting when you pay attention to the story. Marlow has to travel the up the Congo River to reach a mysterious man of power, Kurtz. The plot thickens as Marlow nears Kurtz' station, with knowledge that Kurtz may not be the man of glory he once thought.Now that I have completed reading the final pages of Heart of Darkness, I can say that the plot of the book was good, although it moves very slowly. Entire pages are used to explain simple actions and thoughts. The book is viewed by literary scholars as one of Joseph Conrad's finest novels, but the strong vocabulary can prove too difficult for high school students today, who would choose a television show over a book anytime. I enjoy reading, but the way the story was written was too complicated for me. Progressing through the book, the reading was easier and easier, but still too difficult for me to fully understand. This may be a critically acclaimed book, but I don't think it appeals to the majority of people in my generation. I only recommend it to people who can handle a college-level book, and enjoy its detail-oriented, intricate style."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Read \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" by A.

Quite possibly the least \\"imaginative\\" of Conrad's works, albeit the gratuitous symbolism is of course present."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Nothing positive is coming out of imperialism as practiced in the Congo as Conrad shows it . . . the native population is portrayed as practically sub-human, with their societies untouched by the Europeans. Likewise, the Africans appear to have had no effect on the traders. The narrator is the only one who has compassion for these people, except for Kurtz at the end of his life who, looking back on what he has done, exclaims the horror, the horror. Conrad takes the imperialist society of the late eighteenth century to its extremes and shows how shallow it all is. But this story has greater application. It shows how human beings can be reduced to sub-human beings by members of the \\"superior\\" spociety. This allows the protagonist to treat these beings with something less than humanity, as witnessed throughout history . . today included. The heart of darkness may be in the heart of humanity, not just on a large multi-colored map."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"O.K., but english teach years ago in high school over did this one a bit.

In the nineteenth century King Leopold II of Belgium establshed the Congo as his own personal colony. It was not a colony of Belgium, it belonged soley to Leopold.

He was corrupt and made money in ivory on the side from his \\"official\\" company business, but really was unable to use it for anything.

The riches of Africa were raped and plundered and its peoples humiliated, murdered, displaced and treated as animals. Africa was butchered like a wild animal and the carcass divided amongst the colonial powers.Marlow, the narrator, during that sad epoch, tells his story of a mission to the Congo to pilot a steamboat on the Congo River for \`the Company'. On arrival at the decrepit sham of a Central Station on the River where suspicion and decay and corruption hangs over everything Marlow learned that a very important trading station was in jeopardy and that it's chief, Mr. Kurtz was ill at a deserted trading post 300 miles down stream.The manager of the Central Station, a sordid, greedy, cruel and bloated insecure white man live a life of uncertainty amongst filth and decaying bodies of chained and starving indigenous black people and idle suspicious white workers. And Kurtz is piped to succeed him. And he hates Kurtz with a vengeance. And Kurtz hates and despises him.Kurtz a man \\"of greatness, of generous mind, of noble heart, a great musician, and a man of magnificent eloquence\\" is a man of great influence with the Council in Europe. Kurtz asked to be sent to the outpost. His self declared mission \\"each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things, a center for trade of course, but also humanizing, improving, instructing\\"Kurtz send large hoards of ivory to the Central Station with his assistant and returned alone in a dugout canoe to his trading post. And Kurtz disappeared for nine months; wild rumors reached the Central Station; and the ivory from Kurtz dries up to the consternation of the manager of the Central Station.Going up the river to Kurtz's trading post Marlow experienced the great silence and spookiness of the impenetrable tropical rainforest and the boat followed by angry indigenous people hiding in the thickets. Finding Kurtz, metamorphose has happened, the refined man turned into a maniac, adoring his fence posts with black, dried human heads. The wilderness has found him and crept into his being. His weary brain was haunted by shadowy images - images of wealth and fame - and turbulent angst tormented his soul. He transformed into a heart of darkness. He hoarded all the ivory he could find and claim it as his; he raised an impi of naked spear carrying indigenous black men lead by a black warrior woman and he died lonely and frightened and his body was slid into the turbulent waters of the Congo River."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"In his day, Joseph Conrad had a remarkable way of discribing a scene, very pognant. But as I finished reading Heart of Darkness, it reminded me of the original King Kong movie with Fay Wray. It was scary...in its day."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This may be one of the best novels of the English language. Not an easy read by today's standards but amazing nonetheless. It may have to be read more than once to truly appreciate the greatness of this inner trip into the Heart of Darkness.As a side note Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece \`Apocalypse Now\\" is based on this piece."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness exposes a dark underside to modern history that our history classes in school gloss over--the hideous, murderous tyrrany that King Leopold of the Belgians waged over his Belgian Congo, a tyrrany that ranks with Hitler and other mass murderers. Joseph Conrad's novel puts names and faces and events on that episode. The Everyman's Library version is an inexpensive and beautiful edition of the novel, complete with a ribbon to keep your place."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel is often criticized for its attitude toward Africans and its inclusion of many imperial ideals, however I feel that such criticism is misplaced. I was not offended by the content in the novel because it is clear that it has a purpose. The novel utilizes anti-African sentiment to reveal the absurdity of such beliefs. For this reason it also includes the activities of and common ideals of imperialistic countries. The work is filled with symbolism and statements that invoke the reader to deeply consider truths about the world and \\"civilized\\" society. It successfully illustrates the ills of imperialism on not only the native people but also on the imperial oppressors as well. It is a novel I strongly recommend and feel everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a deep and well written book. Joseph Konrad uses the insanity of Kurtz to illustrate the complex meaning of the jungle and civilization. As Marlow is taken through this adventure, he is the key to finding the genuine purpose of Africa, as he poses as light fighting its way out of the Darkness. He encounters, on many occasions, the evil within the many forces which makes the \\"New Africa\\". Though it takes deep and concentrated thought to comprehend the real meaning of the events shown throughout the book, it thoroughly expresses the madness within the Jungle, Kurtz, and the Darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The novel Heart of Darkness invoked an unusual perspective to civilization through the eyes of the main character Marlow. Marlow experiences all the evils and greed humanity has to offer in a journey down into the impassable darkness, Africa. This darkness Marlow comes to terms with is what many of his colleagues are blind to. He sees that darkness, savageness, and futility exist in all of mankind. The faade of Western Europe civilizing is torn down as the men become surrounded by the harsh jungles of Africa. With the jungle outnumbering the men, their character reverts back to the beginning before men had the luxuries of society. The line between the natives and the sailors is all but lost except for their history. Other than that, at the end of the novel the reader comes away with Conrad's view that there is no real difference to us and the people we call savages.The full meaning of the novel does not become known until the beacon of light, Mr. Kurtz, becomes immersed into the evil of the African people he originally tried to change and civilize. The book exposes the evil plunders of the exploration being done in Africa. The greed of ivory and how it consumes the very heart of Mr. Kurtz, becomes more and more evident has Marlow begins to hear Kurtz's views on the world. Joseph Conrad does show a slightly optimistic side, through the last words spoken by Mr. Kurtz, \\"the horror.\\" Conrad shows that at least humanity realizes their iniquity before they are lost forever.The novel affects people in different ways and I would recommend it to anybody who is willing to give the novel the thought and consideration it deserves."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The movie Heart of Darkness is something that should be viewed after reading the novel first. The film would present a far too intricate and perplexing insight for someone to understand prior to reading the book. For the most part, when people watch movies then they figure that it's the same as reading the book, but in all actuality, the experience is entirely different. If you had watched the movie preceding reading the novel then you would miss out on the reason why the book is so legendary. There are many underlying implications that you can't acquire from watching a mere movie.For instance, at the beginning of every chapter, Joseph Conrad sets the scene for us. He is very detailed when he does this and it literally brings us into the novel. You can't obtain experiences like this from a motion picture, especially one that contradicts the book in so many ways. The novel makes it clear that this is Marlow telling the story and he is speaking in first person, yet in the movie Marlow is just a main character among others. I can see where the filmmakers tried to imply that it was Marlow's story with the movie's beginning and ending where he presented a pair of monologues about his experience. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the original introduction and conclusion to the story would have appeared far superior.Watching the movie was even as though I was viewing a completely other version of the world renowned Heart of Darkness. The only assistance I obtained from watching the movie was an illustration of what the atmosphere was like in Africa. I had trouble identifying that particular aspect in the novel. Other than that feature, I would have been just as well off reading only the novel. Consequently, the film would be a good visual aide if you are having difficulty understanding the book, but it's not expected to be seen as an alternative option to reading the novel."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The gentle whisperings of a river, beautiful sounds which disguise the truths of the water's power. Beautiful ivory, its pale color disguising the savagery from which it came. A simple story, hiding the complexity of its true meaning. This is The Heart of Darkness, a story about greed, savagery and the horrors of the Congo.The original form of this story was the book written by Joseph Conrad. In his narrative he created a strikingly wicked tale of the horrors of both human and inhuman forces. This book has both a well thought out and well excuted story and multiple hidden meanings. One can easily read the outer layer of the book and enjoy it for its frightening intensity, and then, with more difficulty, take the time to dealve deeper into its complex meanings and enjoy it even more. Though this book takes time to read and analyze, it is definately a literary masterpiece worth reading.The Heart of Darkness was later retold in a made for TV movie. I myself saw this movie after having read the book, so it is difficult to say whether or not it would be possible to understand without having read the book first. Overall the movie stayed to the plot of the book, but there were several minor changes. The movie, which I thought was farely enjoyable, is worth watching, but does not even come close to capturing the darkness or depth of the original tale."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I recommend for those readers that are interested in this Conrad work the Penguin library edition for reading of the story itself, and then this book for the information it contains. This Norton Critical Edition is astonishing in the wealth of its resource. Of course, for those who found Apocalypse Now an important film, this book also provides additional, extremely relevant and worthwhile information.I have noticed, that another reader has also recommended &quot;Exterminate All the Brutes&quot; which borrows its title from Conrad's story. I join in recommending that book as well. All of these combined do not add up to a final word on the subjects they open for discussion, but provide even broader vistas for further thought on the subjects.These materials as works of art deserve viewing in spite of &quot;the horror&quot;."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When I finished the book I could not decide exactly on what happened. The profound, deep symbolism in this short novel trascends its natural limits, and derives us to another angle of thought. Kurtz it's not just him; is all of us trying to fight adversity, unknown realms (territories also of our soul) gasping something, believing we are dominating it, and then..the horror, the horrorMarlow is our leader: he pushes us to the heart of Africa (our heart, our nervous system?), to the vast unknown, longing in finding our heroe, and, in the process, becoming one ourselves.This novel expands our conscience (if we know how to read what's not written) permits to get in touch with our innerself, find the horror, but defeat it, and start each day with the unmistakable knowledge that we start over again, and that all depend on us; on how do we plan the journey. We must not just walk, we have to go..."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When Kurtz exclaims \\"The Horror! The Horror!\\", it is in the same sense that we would also cry out if suddenly faced with the unshielded countenance of God. At the threshhold, just before we were either consumed, or absorbed, this too would be our cry.This most remarkable of books is a dissection of the Western psyche. We start with the capital city of the living dead in Europe itself. This is a land of sleepwalkers who have never awakened- they live out their lives spinning castles in the air that ultimately mean nothing. This is the state of the modern Western mind. Theory and profit, but no soul. On the journey down the African coast we encounter the European battleship antiseptically shelling the coast. These are tranplanted westerners hiding in the shells of their technological terrors while lobbing shells into the outer world- without really being contaminated by it. Then we reach the coast, where the high ideals preached in Europe are more and more obviously abandoned the farther inland one travels. When the land and the natives become \\"difficult\\", pure force and brutality are used to overcome and destroy. In other words, if they will not be \\"westernised\\", turned into copies of us, they must be obliterated. Preferably while making us a profit.Kurtz was a strong man. He was ambitious and powerful. Perhaps he kept up the charade of \\"civilising\\" the natives and the land in the name \\"progress\\" longer than anyone else. He kept up these empty lies until he penetraded to the deepest core of the primeval jungle. And then, this hollow shell of ideals and greed imploded. You see, as Conrad points out, Kurtz was fundamentally hollow. Yet Kurtz didn't just die, he was too strong. Instead, into that vacuum rushed the primal force itself. Kurtz became what he hated the most- he became the soul of the jungle- because he had none of his own. He became an \\"animal\\" in it's highest sense, a totally natural man. Indeed he became a natural King, as the native tribes recognised. He and the land were truly one.It is a mistake to judge Kurtz by the standards of the city of the dead. Kurtz and his warriors sweeping across the jungle, taking heads and ivory as trophies, was as natural as lions running down gazelles.... Far more natural than the hypocritical, brutal, soulless, enslavement of the coastal natives in the name of \\"civilisation\\"....."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Heart of Darkness is a psychological journey into man's love/lust for and attachment to a savage and surreal wildnerness. The book is filled with exquisite imagery, and each scene's tone is indelibly set by the surroundings. It is also a commentary on colonialism in Conrad's day. I am not as well veresed on this subject as I would have liked to have been before reading the book, but I found the story fully comprehensible and enjoyable even in this regard. The book is a definiate vocabulary builder."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"English was not Conrad's first language, which makes this accomplishment all the more amazing. Heart of Darkness is a short book - but not a fast read. The prose is thick and making your way through it is like going up the River itself. However, this is done on purpose - it is part of the journey. Every sentence has meaning and every word has a purpose. The story is about the Journey itself, so that by the time you (and it is you) reach Kurtz, you understand him.A lot of those who read this now are Apocalypse Now fans, and that is all well and good - but just don't expect any &quot;Charlie don't surf&quot; lines here. This is a pessimistic novel about the descent of man, the darkness of human nature, and the existential abysses that men may fall into."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Everyone alive should read &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; everyone who loves literature MUST read it. Simply put, it is the best work of one of the best authors of this century. It is also probably the greatest novella of this, or any, century. Since many reviewers have already outlined the plot (and pretty much everyone should already know it for the most part) I will not do so. I also will not write in this review what I feel the major themes of the work are because I believe the most enjoyable thing about reading and re-reading works such as this is discovering the themes for oneself. All I'll say is that &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is well worth the hype. There are those who claim it is racist and this is a view which probably cannot be disproved by the text. However, I do not agree with it. Approach this work with an open mind. What Conrad describes is universal.

His ultra-dense examination of colonialism and the myriad of sociological questions that it raises is THE most powerful novel I have ever read.Like many of Conrad's other works, this masterpiece is misleading in that its shortness suggests it can be read in one sitting. In reality, it is a truly monumental novel, each paragraph of which should be savored and meditated upon, as they are all equally amazing - at the same time beautiful and horrible.It's become a cliche when discussing Conrad, but this novel is truly a journey into the darknesses of the human mind on so many levels."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is without a doubt one of the most amazing books I have ever read. First, let me say that I find it very hard to read, as i do with all of conrad's writing. If you have the same problem, I suggest you just take it slow and don't be afraid to write down what you think he might be talking about at times. The time and energy pays off tremendously. Conrad unravels the intense impact that the jungle has on a mind produced by civilization. This novel is loaded with subtleties about our contact with the dark, primitive aspect of human existence.

Although this story is short, concise, and to the point I must warn younger readers. The wording of this is not especially easy. Unless you are an experienced reader steer clear. I'd say junior in high school and up. If you ignore me prepare for &quot;the horror&quot;."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Brilliant, Stunning, Literarily and Metaphysically moving. Standing proudly on my self as one of the greatest books of all-time, the classic status of this book is well deserved. Not only in its moving message, but in its unparalleled writing, Conrad takes us inside the heart of darkness, the heart of man, and brilliantly displays the dark truth, offering an optomistic view of how we can &quot;breath the dead hippo and not be contaminated.&quot; Very few other books encapsulated such a powerful message as this one, and no other book does it with such great literary value. This masterpiece offers to even the most discriminating reader the truth in man's condition and leaves the reader with the challenge of knowing that truth. If you are lloking for a classic, superbly written, and infinately meaningful book that transcends time, The Heart of Darkness will leave even you breathless."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read this novella my senior year in high school for AP Literature and found it to be amazing. Now, about 3 years later, I'm reading it in my critical thinking class in college. I can really say that Conrad has a very unique writing style (obvious to anyone who has read a page of it) that will throw off readers that are not prepared for this dense story. This story is without a doubt a MUST read for anyone that loves literature as it has incredible technique, style and really shows the power of literature. Read this and analyze it as best as you can, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm a pretty good reader, and have a solid grip on the English language. But literature and \\"wordy\\" books also scare me away. After all, the plot and characters of a story get me interested more than that actually words being used. This is the one exception. The moral ambiguity and darkness of human nature is dripping off the pages through sentences just as shady and murky. The book is only 100 pages so I pressed forward, like Marlowe through the depths of the African jungle. Yes, there were paragraphs I had to re-read a couple times to fully enjoy and understand, but it was well-worth the time. Overall, I finished the book in only a handful of sittings, but have since went back to re-read certain parts again to make sure I fully grasped their meaning.Don't let literature and \\"wordy\\" books scare you away from this one. \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is amazing, and even if you don't like it, it won't take a lot of time to get through. And if you do like it, there are layers of meaning that can be discovered through multiple read-throughs."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is a true tour de force as Conrad artfuly carries the reader into the African experience. The tale is replete with wonderous descriptions painting the inability of \\"conquering\\" the vastness which is Africa. Intermingled with the physical descriptions are protraits of Europeans as well as natives who are hopelessly overcome and even crushed by this wildest of continents. And, throughout are the metaphors as only Conrad can create them. This novella like, say Moby Dick, can be read and reread for new insights time after time. A true Masterwork."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Upon first reading Heart of Darkness, I couldn't help but feel disappointment. It is a book I've always wanted to read, but have put off for one reason or another. But after seeing Apocalypse Now again recently, and being fully mesmerized by it again, I finally decided that I had to read the book. But it just felt like such a letdown after the movie.The differences between the book and the movie are obvious--one is set in 19th century Africa while the other is set in Vietnam. But the core plot lines are the same: a man is sent into the wilderness to \`return' a rogue agent named Kurtz who has gone \`native', or mad. In HOD, Charlie Marlow is a man of the sea who lands a job as a steamship captain in Africa through the efforts of his \`dear aunt'. As he arrives, Marlowe finds many objectionable things. He distrusts many of the Europeans running things, and finds that the steamship he was supposed to take to find Kurtz has been \`sunk', causing much delay. As he awaits repairs, he witnesses the inhumanity with which the Europeans treat the Africans.Marlowe finally gets on his way, is attacked as he approaches Kurtz's camp, but finds the man. Marlowe learns that Kurtz has convinced the natives to treat him as a god and help him violently gather mass quantities of ivory, which Kurtz then uses to enrich himself. (The real reason the rest of the Europeans hate him.) But he is also sick, and Marlowe's crew easily takes him on-board. On the return, Kurtz shows a sliver of the darkness that he has seen, and it affects Marlowe. By now, he is firmly on Kurtz's side.HOD is a short but dense book. The disappointment I felt after my first read mostly stemmed from its difficulty. It didn't grab me. When I read it a second time however, more of it stuck, and I think I could more easily grasp what Conrad was trying to do. HOD is a study of the \`darkness' that can live within us all. But it's not just Kurtz who has seen and lived in darkness, but also the Europeans, who so brutally treat their African \`hosts'. Conrad shows us this battle between good and evil--the good the Europeans thought they were doing by \`teaching' the Africans to be \`civilized' versus their inhumane treatment of them. This is at core a deep and satisfying story that will enrich the reader more with each reading. In fact, I would say don't bother with the book at all unless you plan to read it at least twice.Other disappointments I had with the book probably arose from having watched Apocalypse Now first. The movie centers on the trip down the river, where as the trip itself is barely touched upon in HOD. Also, Kurtz is barely on the stage and most of what we know of him is shown to us through other people's eyes. As such, he is hard to get a grasp of, especially with just one reading. (There was a reason the movie needed a Brando to play Kurtz... the brief glimpses we get of the character needed a strong and mesmerizing performance.)Still, this is a classic. I haven't read anything that better crystallizes the duality of human nature. There are probably no other topics that we need to read about and understand more than this one, and here Conrad wrote the manual on how to approach it.As for the Kindle version, it had the usual occasional typo, but nothing major. The biggest miss here is not having some sort of introduction or critical material. HOD is such a difficult book and I would recommend that most people buy a version with additional material to help them navigate the story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Horror! The Horror!The \\"brilliant\\" Kurtz, with his crazy-talking manic German disciple, his legion of reverent, deadly head-hunters and his stately native goddess in full headdress, is, in the end, just a man, whose writings and life are as rambling and incoherent as his last uttered words, \\"The Horror. The Horror.\\"Marlowe, the narrator of the story who risks his life simply to talk to the \\"brilliant\\" Kurtz learns nothing of the man's brilliance, either from his dying words or from his writings.After losing his boat pilot to a barrage of arrows from Kurtz's reverent natives, Marlowe escapes with his life, and the body of the dying Kurtz and then sadly consoles Kurtz's inconsolable grief-stricken bride-to-be by lying to her and telling her that her brilliant lover talked incessantly of her and spoke her name as his last, dying words.Well no. That was a lie of kindness given by Marlowe who has a shred of decency and refrains from talking about Kurtz's stately native goddess and their strange sexual practices or the shrunken heads surrounding the brilliant Kurtz's ivory outpost.I don't know what Conrad's religious beliefs were, but it's safe to assume that in a world with man-gods who are as flawed as Kurtz the ivory trader, life will be a descent into a heart of darkness in which life and death are both meaningless and frightening.This book is dense with ideas, difficult sentences and expensive, little-used words that will stretch your vocabulary and very likely your patience.I'm torn between thinking that it's brilliant, and that it's actually a joke played on pretentious readers and undergraduate students who must read it in their English Lit. class.When you describe the plot to a friend or state it in writing, I think you can't help but see Conrad's sense of humor in it all. Really, it's quite absurd in a grand way."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"From its murky openings, aboard a marooned yawl in the Thames Estuary, overlooking Gravesend, Heart of Darkness spools out into a fascinating, enigmatic portrayal of human desires and corruptions. Conrad's mysterious prose - 'ship in a bottle imagery' as dismissed by Nabokov, but actually deeply compelling - perfectly crafts a curious tale, narrated by Marlow, as he enters the Heart of Darkness. A colonial adventure that, yes, pricks the comfortable colonial sensibilities as held by many of Conrad's contemporaries around the turn of the 20th Century, but also does much more. It's imagery of European bounty hunters, savages, the jungle, the stations, and at the centre of it all the barbaric, charismatic Kurtz gives the reader far more to think about than a simple anti-colonial treatise. It is, at its depths, an enquiry into the fundamental preposterousness of human striving and a desire to stamp a mark on the world - to make money, to find valuable work, to find adventure. Whatever it is people aim for. Conrad achieves the highest literature can manage. To enable the reader to fundamentally reconsider his or her vision of history, and perception of the world.If you like, get hold of the audio version narrated by David Horowitz. He perfectly captures the rolling cadences of Conrad's prose. And the horror, the horror!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\`Heart of darkness' is probably Joseph Conrad's most well know novel and it makes for short but powerful reading. In just over hundred pages you get intense character study, as well as brief insight into British colonial trade and dealings. This book follows Marlow's journey up an African river to find a colleague, Mr Kurtz, and explores the break down in the latter's psyche as he becomes immersed in tribal life and becomes affected by solitude in the jungle. The film \`Apocalypse Now' is famously based on this novel and if you have seen that film you will picture Kurtz's disintegration all the more vividly. The prose is a little stilted in places and the sentence structure is a touch convoluted, but the images Conrad paints with those sentences more than makes up for the minor extra effort that is required to enjoy this book. I feel Conrad could've explored Kurtz's descent into madness and created a more rounded story but apart from that this was quite enjoyable. A classic for good reason and although this is one you'll have to concentrate to read and enjoy fully, the effort more than pays off in the end.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm reviewing only the free Kindle ebook version of this, as prepared/produced by Boss & Widger. I know Amazon lumps together all the various publishers and editions in one foul lump, thus making deciphering the reviews near impossible.This short novel is told as a story within a story. An unnamed narrator introduces us to the modern-day scene, to the setting where the story is being told, the story of this journey of the main character, Charles Marlow. Thus Marlow's first-person story (surely 95%+ of the text) is the bulk of the book and is thus in quotation marks. The trouble with this edition is that the beginning quotation marks are sometimes dropped from the text. This resulted in me thinking the narrative had gone back to the rather insignificant beginning narrator, and thus back to the present day. But no, it's still Marlow's story, just without the necessary quote marks. This happens too often.Another problem I had with this e-text is that very many paragraphs are not indented. Add that to some instances of unusual line breaks, and I often wondered whether I was reading a new paragraph at all, or still the previous one. Throw in the occasional absence of quotation marks, and again I was also sometimes wondering if Kurtz was still telling his story or if the unnamed narrator was. The story isn't a particularly easy read (to me anyway) in the best format, and if you add these annoying and confusing etext errors, it makes it even less so.This is a free production, put together by folks who only meant to make the book available for us cheapos who want it for free. It seems unfair to criticize them at all, but in this day of ebooks quickly becoming more and more the norm, I only mean to let others know that they might want to seek out another version, if one is available. I hope to find a better (free) version to put on my Kindle in place of this one."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a classic of Victorian literature. It is the tale of one man's descent into madness and the possibility of evil that exists in all men's souls. A short novella of just over one hundred pages, Conrad's work is far from an \\"easy\\" read, even though nothing much happens, for it raises many psychological and moral questions that cannot fully be answered.\\"Heart of Darkness\\" begins with a frame narrative, with men aboard a boat on the Thames River awaiting sail - a scant device that allows Marlow to tell of his journey into Africa. Marlow recalls going to work for a Belgian trading company and being commanded to travel into the interior (on an unnamed river one can presume is the Congo) to bring back Kurtz, a company man who has \\"gone native\\" to say the least. Marlow is shocked by what has happened to Kurtz, a man whose behavior is more primitive and evil than the so-called \\"savages\\" who populate the country. Yet there is something enigmatic about Kurtz that draws Marlow to him and it is an enigma that will haunt him long after he has left the Congo.The novella is based on Conrad's own experiences in the Congo and the atrocities he witnessed. A modern audience cannot read the novella without a dialogue concerning racism, yet it is evident that the so-called \\"savages\\" are shown to be more civilized than their \\"civilized\\" European counterparts, and that Conrad employed a great amount of irony in his writing. \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is truly an indictment against colonization and the abuse of power - a message that still resonates in today's world."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is one of the greatest novels ever written. The problem is it is so layered that it is hard to just pick up and read.

Read them both together and I am sure you will come away with a better reading experience and appreciation for this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"this is a very powerful, irony laden book that on one level talks about the idiocies of colonial expansion and on another takes you on a journey inside yourself, into the \\"heart of darkness\\" as Conrad puts it. it is a very dense book, even though it looks short at first, it takes a while to read. Also it has many levels of meaning that can only be drawn by careful reading. Nevertheless, anyone can gain a profound amount from this book, it is a classic of english literature and is recommended for anyone. Though I like nonfiction books much more, I do appreciate fiction if it is powerful and interesting to me, which this book most certainly is."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel was an exciting swirl of adventure, underlying history, and a good deal of morals that people that were alive in those times enjoyed. Joseph Conrad does an excellent job of blending all of these things together to make a novel that tells a story and teaches a lesson at the same time. Conrad does several themes throughout this novel. One of those themes is the ongoing battle between good and evil/light and darkness. This struggle is represented through the good deeds and intentions of the Europeans against the will of the Forest and its malice that corrupts the open-minded. He also uses the \\"Russian Doll\\" technique that displays a story within a story. He uses this to show events of the past through character flashbacks and tell stories of the past through multiple-character narration. He also uses many examples of futility like putting out fires with buckets that have holes in them and shooting at a random African coastline with the cannons of a ship along with other similar examples.I believe that a book can always be more fun to the reader than a movie due to the use of imagination that a movie with its visual effects can easily limit. Also a book is the original thoughts of the author whereas a movie that is only based on the book the ideas of the author are subject to change by the director. All in all I believe that a book is ninety eight percent of the time going to be better than its movie."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"And if you gaze into the abyss,the abyss gazes also in to you\\"-Nietzsche- (beyond good and evil)I'm 26, to a reader of my generation is very difficult to approach this novel without remembering scenes from Coppola's mesmerical movie, but, once you get on the boat and start going up river, you are way beyond anything previously told.Conrad's story deals with the perils of a young sailor,Marlow, sent to find old, misterious man Kurtz, to do this Marlow takes a boat up a river deep in the heart of the dark congo, as the story moves on, the plot gets more and more psycological, as if with every mile travelled the narration needed to get more technical, more insightful.The heart of darkness takes us too close to a sane mind going off the ground, it's a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's narrator Marlowe tells the tale in the special reflective and complex prose that seems to give as many questions as answers. He sets the tone and the mood so special in Conrad for this tale of the white man's venture into the heart of darkness, the heart which on one level is the civilization or absence of the civilization of the dark continent, and on the other in the deepest sense in the soul of Man himself. For what Mr. Kurtz reveals ultimately is the horrow within himself, perhaps the horror of the evil of the deeds of colonializing civilization, perhaps the evil of the human soul itself stript bare of civilization's restrictions and inhibitions. In any case the tale told by Marlowe is one which does not provide an easy answer, but as in Conrad's best work provides an opportunity for deeper contemplation. And all this done with that pensive and wisely descriptive prose of Conrad which at once lures us, captivates us , imprisons us and makes us long like Kurtz himself in the heart of Africa, to escape from it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book is actually short compared to many other books of similar difficulty, yet requires more time to read than one might expect. There are many metaphors and deeper meanings you need to think about to totally understand the book.

I would rate it a 5, but this book was too difficult to read through smoothly."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read this book for the first time years ago while traveling through Asia, bumping my way along cragged roads and 3rd world squallar. It felt like going up the river. When I returned I was stumped by how oblivious, care free, and confident everyone was in my home town. You mention the lives and the conditions under which others live in what constitutes the other 80% and it is scoffed at in the all empowered first world. Conrad's disconnection upon returning to England spoke to me. It is the same disconnection that a man returning from a harrowing war might feel upon returning to the hearth. There is a deep implication in the pages of Heart of Darkness. It rings to the effect of: The world is immense, and for the most part, in terrible shape, and that we are poorer in spirit, knowledge, and insight by not coming to terms with this broader reality."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is a masterpiece. Joseph Conrad's story of British imperialism in the Congo is eerily, brilliant, and thoughtful, to sum it up in a few words. Symbolism, imagery, and ambiguity in the novel allows readers to fathom what evil, darkness, and good really is. And most people don't really understand that. . .Although Heart of Darkness is a little over 100 pages, its a thick read if readers wish it to be. If not, people can whiz through it in a couple hours. Yet, its a masterpiece for it depth, not its length.I encourage anyone who wishes to read a deep novel to pick up a copy of Heart of Darkness. Its writing is amazing, the story is intriguing, and the afterthought will remain with you for a long time. For those who don't want to read a book, watch Apocalypse Now, the Americanized version (American &quot;imperialism&quot; in Viet Nam, spreading democracy)."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Get this book.And read it, and then read it once more, its not that long.Then wait a week, then read it a final time.It is almost impossible to comprehend this entire book if one reads it only once through. It is very in depth, and very complicated, no word is wasted in this book, hence it cannot, and should not be 'skimmed'. No passage is wasted, there is basically no unneeded character.Secondly, some persons have reviewed this book, and have said something to the effect that everything evil is black, and some have gone so far to say this book is racists towards blacks/Africans, and they are entitled to their opinions, however as I see it, both opinions are against mine.However, if any prejudice exists in this book, it is just a little bit, and toward women, but then again, this was written at the turn of the century, and thus was the culture.And about the color black, it has been used over and over in history to show evil. But in this book, it isn't as much evil, as it symbolizes the truth, and light symbolizes mankinds devices to be happy, and sometimes this means to aviod the darkness (truth). Main examples of this are african slaves themselves. Ivory is light, and make people happy, the slaves are dark in this book and are the truth behind the ivory. Then in the end when Kurtz dies, he only can see black, even with a candle in his face; when one dies they supposedly see 'their life flash by'. I think Conrad is using this, and Kurtz is seeing the truth (dark) about his life, and cannot see the candle, and mutters his last words &quot;The Horror... &quot; A last example of this is when Marlow is speaking with The Intended (Kurtz's fiancee), and lies to her, up to this point, the room is getting darker and darker, and if Marlow were to tell the truth, quite possibly the Intended (her forehead was white, rembemer, because she didn't see the truth about Kurtz) would see the truth, and all light would be gone, and the room would have been pitch black.Anyways, as I said, this IS a masterpiece, it should be read several times, and should be thought about quite seriously."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Many people have given this novelette a bad review, and I believe that this is purely due to their lack of understanding. It is true that this novelette is one of the most difficult in the English language (and cliff note are HIGHLY recommended) the diction and symbolism reveal Conrad as a master in the literary world. One issue that most people have with this novel is the racist factor. This book was written in 1902! What do you expect? People argue that in this novelette everything evil is black. This color motif has been used throughout history, and it is not necessarily affiliated with the race; however, in this case, it is arguable. I confess that I am unable to see racism on the part of Conrad. Yes, the characters in the novel, mostly the manager, committed racial atrocities against the natives, however the whites symbolized a spiritual death. In the novelette, the only truly evil people were white. (Oops, I think I got side tracked in my attempt to defend HoD and discredit those whom found the book a &quot;horror.&quot; Frankly this book is a brilliant insight to the true nature of man and the potential for man to succumb to his many lusts and commit grievous atrocities against other men. Conrad illustrates the necessity to navigate through evil in order to live and the burden of human freedom, the ability to choose between the evils we are faced with and the unpredictable outcome that spawns from our decisions. The majority of the people who gave this novelette a bad review were students that were forced to read it. In a world of telivision, the internet, and video games, students have lost the patience to read such novels, purely because they are too lazy to actually think while reading. For such people, I agree that they should not read HoD, because they should not have to use their brain cells for comprending the text, when it's obvious that they need to devote their entire brain just so that they can awknowledge the existance of the words on the page."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I think normal interpretations of this book are wrong. I don't think that it is a commentary on imperialism. Imperialism is just the context of the novel. Conrad no doubt was influenced by the politics and culture of the time, but has no real point in regards to the novel.Going deeper, seeing the novel as a commentary of the \\"darkness\\" of evil in every human's heart is equally flawed. Conrad did use Kurtz as a person who had chosen to embrace his evil, but viewing Kurtz as an allegory for the \\"meaning\\" of the novella is just as narrow as reading it as a simple adventure novel. Marlowe is the main character in the story, and he chooses good over evil in the end. He inspires the listeners on the boat on the Thames to confront their own \\"heart of darkness\\" as he himself did. The book is about self discovery, and thus there are no \\"answers,\\" and thus no \\"meaning.\\" The book is meant to only inspire uneasiness and self discovery, just as Marlowe did at the end of the book to his small audience.This is challenging to people, and the easiest thing to do would be to label this as a dark commentary on the evil of humanity. But is it really? Search inside yourself, and you will have accomplished what this book sets out to do. I certainly did.

The story was in a remarkable classic collection he had used in college called Prose and Criticism. At the time I understood myself to be in a dangerous world, a place of dichotomies, understood myself uneven to the task of interpretation of the pieces we read, naive, read within his constructs of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in man and looking at works this teacher felt spoke to human nature,human choices, capacities, human thought, writing, best efforts to capture who we are.As good an English teacher as exists.I recall curling in a chair at home a wing back chair opening the book and falling into a trip down or rather up a river into the heart of the unknown.It's the kind of story I suspect once you start will grip you until it ends. I was \\"spellbound.\\"I didn't know then that later it would be revisited with Brando giving a fairly interesting re-enactment when I decided to take my younger brother to a movie that so disturbed him he ran out to run home turning and braking an ankle that never again allowed him to play sport.But what of the story? One of the few problems I have writing here or anywhere about a book is that I feel that the writer or reader might judge a piece better not by a summary, or not only by a summary, but by its affect on a reader. It seems that is useful to me. That evidentially offends some. But it is all I have.I had known of this incredible darkness within my father. I'd witnessed his struggle with civilizing, with his climb into academia, the poverty of his birth, his amazing capacity with numbers, teaching, with leadership. He had a life within \\"hallowed halls\\" but my insights came as well from setting this against the \\"other,\\" from a man I watched with a perspective and tone not unlike this narrator has, I watched, seeing that as I aged/he aged my dad seemed to reveal to me the bleak darkness of his humanity. His ability to access his troubles and fury and spew it on a family, to twist, devolve, become unrecognizable. Violent, unreasoning. I'd seen and avoided, or endured a ride into the heart of his self loathing, his capacity to become able to take a shot gun and fire it at a friend of my brothers, missing him, but to terrorize us as he blamed, obfuscated, wrenched and allowed violence to find a seat in his soul. And the story talked to me about this. The primal. One devolution leading to another.No, I am not talking about a father that was news at 11, but I am talking about one that would slap you into smiling for a picture at three. So reading as the book falls away the civilizing, as you enter the jungle heat, on the ship of fools, I felt I entered the darkness of the soul. It served as an explanation for me of my own observations, artistic, yes. Art does this for me. It glimpses the unsayable. It reads between the lines. At that point in my life just the tension of my daily life was a thing that couldn't be \\"spoken,\\" I'd have lacked words. Still lack them for this, distrust them. It seemed to me this piece of literature spoke to the dual nature of my own life.I've often felt like Goldilocks or a Germanic fairy tale. Setting out into the heart of the dark forest, erring for lack of application of some stated rule or precept not understood as rule, finding the dangers and the realities in nightmarish form burning me alive with the truths. Burning bushes. Have you ever considered that one part of the biblical tale, that this bush utterly nuked the one that encountered it? I have. I have. I learned a tremendous amount from that early life to apply into my work and life looking,thinking, much later- not least of which is this view of the human turned away from mitigating anything from the primal drives.Heart of Darkness spoke to me about the battle waged and ultimately the reasons to take my life and go into teaching, to make choices that were not about living unaware. It actually served me well.Would I say it is a metaphorical piece, actually I would, commentary on colonialism too and other follies of man, yes in some respects, full of offending characterizations-sure- but it was for me as if I'd gotten gripped by the horror of something that stole into a day, and bled it until I understood better the depravity, and perhaps as was the case with my kin what had blackened and been beyond that parent. As he faced his life fouled and fouling. Written to the ultimate extreme. Brando captured that because he knew it in himself. Clearly.Right after reading I was assigned an essay on man, What is Man and failed the paper for a comma splice.Ultimately my only conclusion then, and my only conclusion now, with the splicing a representation of my faulty receptors, is a being can control his responses in situations, where he cannot control the hands dealt. This story assisted my crystallization of those understandings.The Life of Pi, The Open Boat, both seemed to hold me in that wing back in similar veins though different times.Not that this could get any more personal, but at this time I was grappling, as were many teens, with the horror of reading and learning of the concentration camps of Germany in WW2, reading Frankl. And it happens then released just soon, soon after my reading to public TV in America for the first time was the footage of the scenes seen by our soldiers as they entered and liberated the camps. Withheld all those years. I watched that too, then, in that time of America's two hundredth, held by the reality, over held by the prose. In my time of feeling far from invincible, yet a teen. Knowing with simple truth there in those piles were the beings that had beheld the horror of the capability of man gone utterly to the extreme of his capacity to hate. Perhaps family (of mine/of yours), perhaps the most needed alive to speak to us, we as witness? to live their stolen lives. And what of those capable of all of this. Were they too kin? Of a kind in a \\"race\\" I inhabit? Is that possible. Heart of Darkness poses this. But we as a people lived it. I sat as I went metaphorically up that river of suffering and pain seeing my life as a potential to affect others with creativity, with my capacities, with a desire to eschew this nightmare.It is a book that rides this river. A sacred knowledge that allowed me insights at a very formative time. Art."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The novel, Heart of Darkness, is a story that searches deep into the human psyche. This exceptional piece of literature is steeped in mystery and suspense which pulls the reader into the true, hidden meaning behind the words. Joseph Conrad specifically choose every word in this novel; his work has helped enrich the English language.Heart of Darkness was prolific for its time because of the in-depth use of hidden meaning. While reading this book, one feels as if exciting events are happening inside of every sentence. This is because of the \\"Russian Doll\\" effect. In other words, there are many layers of truth contained within a singular meaning. In the novel, Marlow visits a doctor at the company headquarters. This visit was for the doctor to take measurements of Marlow's head. On the surface this appears to be a strange physical. As the story continues, Marlow and the reader come to realize that these measurements are taken because of mental issues that develop when someone travels into the Darkness. The doctor then states that he has never been able to measure someone's head after he or she returns. This hidden meaning alerts the reader that even if Marlow returns, he will not be the same as when he left.The Heart of Darkness is also renowned for its use of symbolism. In the novel, Kurtz is sent into the Darkness as an emissary of light although this is far from what he brings. Kurtz instead brings with him the greed and evil that civilization breeds within the great European cities. Marlow, on the other hand, symbolizes a third-party view, unbiased in the beginning. As the story progresses Marlow makes a decision as to what he symbolizes. He chooses to stand for the visible evil contained within the story, like Kurtz. The visible evil is the lesser of the two evils contained within the story.This novel is an excellent book to explore and learn about writing. I would highly recommend this novel for anyone who desires a challenge and enjoying himself at the same time. Heart of Darkness was a great adventure into the English language that spans the length of time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"~This was the first novel I read by Joespeh Conrad, and I just finished reading it again a few days ago. This book is one of the most interesting stories that also examines the character of a man. Marlow is an older sailor who tells the tale of his time as captain of steamship in Africa. He works for a an ivory trading company, and his mission is to go up river to Kurtz's station. Marlow vividly recalls his thoughts and feelings from his trip up the river. After an introduction to how he~~ came to his position, we join Marlow in Africa as he is awaiting his command. It is here that he first hears of the extraordinary Kurtz. The manager, who seems greedy, and his brick layer, who wants to be Assistant manager, don't like Kurtz. But the more Marlow hears about Kurtz, the more he wants to talk with him. As he repairs his ship, as he sails up river, his anticipation builds. Nearing Kurtz's station, I could feel Marlow's angst when he believes Kurtz dead. The man Kurtz had been~~ was no more. He had become someone else, a man with power. The desire for more ivory had possessed him. In his last words, Kurtz reveals his opinion on life and the relationships therein: &quot;the horror, the horror.&quot; The story remains one of my favorites.~"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm going to be a high school senior next year and I chose to read this for my summer reading.

There, he observes the corruptibility of man's nature, heart, and mind. This portrayal did not shock me as I would have expected, but that is most likely because I knew the story and imperialism's effects.Extremely long paragraphs and a continuous retrospective made this book difficult to read for long periods of time. However, having gotten through it, I can confidently say that it was worth the time spent."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Throughout Heart of Darkness Marlow is terribly confused. The virtues and morality-the restraint-that he thought to be characteristic of man and integral for his survival are actually only exigencies. Though he maintains a calm and commanding presence, inside he nearly shatters from this revelation. And constantly he hears the drums that beat in time to his heart-he feels the wildness of the jungle tugging at him, coercing so gently that one might not notice until after the darkness had already taken his soul.Even in the beginning of the novel, Marlow's eyes were closed to the reality of the Company. When his aunt naively praises the company for its \\"charitable ambitions\\", he gently corrects her, informing her that it is in fact a company fun for profit. As the novel progresses, Marlow is given more than enough reason to despise the Company. The man-of-war shelling bullets into an empty beach reeked of insanity. Even nature seemed tinged with death and oppressive despair.Marlow encounters the chief accountant wearing his spotless white clothing and is sickened. This sycophant and hypocrite appears to Marlow twice as corrupt and uncivilized as the natives do. Marlow despises the manager whom he meets later on as well for being hollow and false.On his journey to Kurtz's Inner Station Marlow is bombarded with news of Kurtz. All view Kurtz with a sort of fearful respect-it is as if they are speaking of some omniscient boogieman that will appear if you say its name aloud. Even when criticizing him they speak in low voices tinged with dread.Marlow has begun to abhor the Company. As he hears its agents speak bitingly of this man, he comes to a resolution. He is going to be on whatever side is against the Company. Proving that he has already allowed the darkness to seep into his blood somewhat, he tells his first lie to the Manager. Even though Kurtz is only a void to Marlow Kurtz is already influencing him.Marlow's abandonment of society's values is further evidenced in his relation to the cannibals. \\"Fine fellows-cannibals-in their place. There were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them\\". Seen from the view of society this is a bizarre comment, one Marlow would not have thought if he were still in his native city. Marlow realizes that the natives of the jungle have not let the darkness overtake them as the Company agents have-that just because one lives in the jungle is not a justification to lack restraint. Moreover, Marlow is even more confused as \\"civilized society\\" and \\"chaotic but not entirely dark jungle\\" war with one another. He is trying to choose his nightmare.This internal conflict is consummated when Marlow encounters Kurtz alone in the forest. Here Marlow feels the darkness stronger than ever before-the drums beat on insanely. \\"I thought I would never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age...\\"Here is Marlow's choice of nightmares-here is the point where he is forced to choose. To Kurtz crouched on all fours, he says, \\"You will be lost, utterly lost\\", perhaps speaking to himself as well. Therefore, Marlow's sanity (as sanity is generally perceived) is speaking to him, and Marlow has chosen to return to civilization after all, though from hereafter he will have a sharper clarity of the ambiguity of goodness.Marlow's internal struggle is what the entire book illumines. Through Marlow's \\"choice of nightmares\\", we are made aware of our own choices."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Initially, this novel seemed bland - little more than a superficial narrative.

The rest of the essays are of the same low-caliber. Read the novel by all means, but do yourself a favor and get a different edition."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is Joseph Conrad's nightmare vision of colonialism in the Africa of the 1890's: cynical bureaucrats - callous, incompetent, greedy and stupid to a man - exploiting the locals, spreading death and devastation, squeezing profits from a miserable trade in elephant tusks; while the most \\"advanced\\" and idealistic of company agents, a \\"universal genius\\" named Kurtz - runs totally amuck, setting himself up as a god among the natives, raiding villages, beheading rebels, practicing \\"unspeakable\\" rites, all on the theory that his methods will turn a mere trading post into a \\"beacon of humanizing, improving and instructing.\\" When his ideals are thwarted, Kurtz has another prescription: \\"Exterminate all the brutes.\\"HOD is a great piece of writing, complex and ambiguous enough to support any number of interpretations. But not all of them are well-founded. Chinua Achebe, to take an example, criticizes Conrad's picture of Africa as \\"racist\\". This misses the point of the novel, which is not to depict Africans with factual accuracy, but to explore the minds and methods of the colonialists - especially their tendency to be corrupted by isolation, power and moral pretension. Conrad is an 'equal-opportunity pessimist' and one should not expect flattering portraits of Africans in a book filled with scathing portraits of Europeans. Nor would it make sense for Marlow - Conrad's narrator - to describe the Africans - whom he has only observed superficially - with an insider's sophistication and empathy. Marlow is a level-headed fellow of broad sympathies, but not, thankfully, a multiculturalist or a purveyor of politcally correct cliches.The central character - Kurtz - is prophetic: With his charisma, his extremism, his self-delusion, his gift for spellbinding oratory, his egomania parading itself as humanitarian zeal - he foreshadows the intellectual charlatans and mass-killers of the 20th Century, from Lenin to Jim Jones.A remarkable work."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad is an amazing writer! English is his THIRD language, too! This book is so incredibly packed with symbolism and beautiful, almost poetry-like, writing.

I did my term paper in my British Literature class on it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's novel about one man's journey into the heart of darkness is considered a classic, and for good reason. This novel has no fear in providing the reader with detailed descriptions of all the horrors that take place throughout its pages.The novel starts out with Marlow, the main character, sitting down with a few of his ship-mates to tell a story. Normally Marlow's stories aren't ones to stay up for, but he quickly ensnares the listeners with his disturbing tale of madness. Marlow was the captain of a steamboat who ends up at a slave-trading post along the banks of a huge river in Africa. While at the post, not only does Marlow witness some of the most horrible things you can imagine, but he also hears many rumors and stories of a brilliant man, Kurtz, who runs another post farther up the river, and farther into the deep wilderness. Kurtz is supposed to be next in line to run everything with the Company, but the rumors running around the post aren't all good ones, and Marlow is eventually commissioned to take his steamboat upriver and find Kurtz. Once Marlow finally reaches his destination, the book really takes the reader over with its frightening descriptions of Kurtz and his situation that he created being alone out at this post with the natives for the longest time.Conrad's writing, as most classical writing, is a little hard to follow at moments, and while the book should be appreciated for its elegant, disturbing descriptions, I actually felt that the dialog between the characters, particularly Kurtz and Marlow was the strongest point of the novel. As Marlow comes into contact with more people who actually know Kurtz, the reader is informed again and again what a brilliant man he is, and how just listening to him talk can be the best thing in the world. But when Marlow and Kurtz finally meet, the reader is only given a few snippets of conversation, and the rest goes unmentioned by the author except for a couple parts at the end. While this small criticism of the novel doesn't mean that it isn't still a classic, it just means that in terms of this particular reader, I think it could have been even better and more powerful than it was.But other than that one small beef, I have nothing bad to say about this novel. Conrad was a gifted writer who seemed to understand the effect that shocking images can have on a reader. The images spoken of in his novel aren't pointlessly graphic at all, they are all engineered so the reader can understand the true nature of everything that was going on in during this time.On a side note, reading this novel helped me understand Apocalypse Now a whole lot more than I did before."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"On my third try in 10 years, I finally got through Heart of Darkness. The first two times I was scared away by the prose and the heaviness of its reputation as a \\"classic\\" (an appelation that kills so many books), but I decided, after re-watching Apocalypse Now, that I needed to set aside some time to read the novella. And I'm glad I did - what a wonderfully dark, penetrating novel... right in the vein of turn-of-the-century symbolism, but with one foot grounded firmly in the real world. It's a nightmare rendered more nightmarish because it happens in broad daylight.A word on the prose: When I first tried reading Heart of Darkness years ago, I felt the same way as a lot of the negative reviewers here, namely, that Conrad's prose was dull, overly ornamental, and cumbersome. This time I was amazed by how effective it is: Marlowe's speech is pregnant with irony and shards of bitter humor, and the ornamental nature kicks up whenever he finds he cannot express \\"the horror\\" in mere words. It the prose of desperation, exposing -like the fragile veneer of civilization- the falsity of language when dealing with the primal darkness.So why not 5 stars? As amazing and thought-provoking as the novella is, that ending should have been cut. Its melodrama rings a little false after the enormity of what we've just read, and even though the irony hangs heavy, the pace grinds to a halt. After Kurtz, we want to sink into ourselves; the jarring return to our own lives is enough to accomplish the irony that Conrad intended.Almost perfect. And highly recommended."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Heart of Darkness is a great novel for one who wants to venture into a place full of corruption and savagery.

When reading this book I had every scene totally drawn out in my head and I knew what every character looked like. This book had many pieces and when I finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed. After I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a mistake.The movie cut out so many substantial parts. For example, in the novel Marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. This was a big source of futility. In the movie that part was just left out. The movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. What purpose did that scene have, other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey? It's as if the script writer didn't even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie.If I had not read the novel before I had watched the movie I would have been thoroughly confused.

The emotions Marlow displays are awe (towards Kurtz), disdain (towards the misdeeds of the company Marlow works for and the misdeeds of the \\"natives\\"), and fear. The intensity of such emotions draws one to follow the monologue till the end. I grew interested in this novel due to the ubiquitous references to it in contemporary political literature. The book I found however to be of psychological nature more than anything else. Never once while reading was I convinced that ideology was the crux of the matter. To the contrary I felt as if imperialism/colonialism were used as articles to justify the existence of the puzzle that was Kurtz. Conrad may have intended Kurtz, in his bleakness and contradictions, to be an embodiment of such ideologies, as contemporary critics like to put it. Such arguments naturally lend themselves to the interpretation that this novel is a critique of imperialism. It may well be, if one can assume that Conrad understood the highly politicized term \\"imperialism\\" as we do now. I suspect that this novel is instead really a critique, or a report, of \\"the present,\\" the circumstance Conrad had experienced."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure I &quot;got&quot; this book altogether. I'm sure there is something else hidden in the text; some eye-awakening symbolism, some brilliant analysis buried in a complex maze made more cumbersome by Joseph Conrad's circumlocution.I read this book with more than a few trips to the Dictionary, and, at times, I found myself re-reading the same paragraph. Conrad's prose is difficult, at times overwhelmingly so.Reading over criticisms of the book yielded some insights into imperialism (or something). But I didn't get that at all. I still don't, really. I guess, stretching it, you would bump into something akin to that. After all, here is Marlow, the protagonist, going off to Africa and all he finds is madness (not that he could see past his nose, what with all the fog and darkness, and gloominess, and broodingness).Instead, what I found was something bothersome lurking in the middle of all that confusion. Except it only related to me, you see, not to the world &quot;out there.&quot; The book is an exploration of two peoples inner psychology. It is disturbing, to be sure, in the same way that existentialism is sometimes said to be disturbing - when done in a particular way, it leads to angst and meaninglessness. That &quot;hell is other people&quot; concept.Here, judge for yourself:&quot;...it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence - that which makes its truth, its meaning - its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dream - alone.&quot; (p. 39)&quot;...but I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself. Your own reality - for yourself, not for others - what no other man can ever know.&quot; (p. 41)&quot;Droll thing life is - that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself - that comes too late - a crop of unextinguishable regrets.&quot; (p. 100)That's the theme, as I see it, of this novel. Never mind the arguments about this novel's \`hidden' attacks on imperialism (a double meaning on \`heart of darkness'-for one, it is the depth of your soul and, for two, it is the depth of Africa). It is the book's deeply penetrating and disturbing account of introspection that is most memorable.And on those grounds, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a tale of Marlow, an English seaman who has always dreamt ofexploring the Congo and the heart of Africa. Told through the frame of an unnamednarrator, Marlow tells his story to the narrator and two others aboard a ship anchored onthe Thames, near London. Marlow weaves a tale of his deep journey into the Congo, aftera job with an English trading company becomes available. As Marlow works his waytowards the Inner Station, he sees the mass destruction of the people and land, due to theimperialism of Europe. He also becomes intrigued by the talk of the enigmatic andprofound manager of the inner ivory trading post, Kurtz. Marlow learns slowly that Kurtzis a very successful, but unstable character that has resorted to savagery towards thenatives in his post. Marlow views Kurtz as an idealist like himself and begins to view himas sort of savior. When Marlow finally reaches Kurtz and his outpost, he sees that Kurtzhas complete control over the natives, who attack Marlow, and that Kurtz brutally killsany opposition, as Kurtz has their heads placed atop poles in his courtyard. Marlow meetsup with a sick Kurtz for only a small portion of the story, but after hearing Kurtz speak ofhis great plans for Africa and hearing his dying words of \\"the horror, the horror\\", referringmost likely to the human condition, Marlow realizes that Kurtz was simply a \\"mad soul\\",filled with darkness. There is a darkness within all of us that can present itself at any time;in Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" the darkness and evil of Kurtz, Marlow, andImperialism shine through and as a result slowly taint and destroy everything around them.The tone presented in the novel helps to point out a powerful theme that darknessis contained within every man. The author's attitude towards the brutality of the Africansby the Europeans is clearly sympathetic and a strong commentary against Imperialism andthe evils of those Europeans. The tone changes after Kurtz dies, going from Marlowrespecting Kurtz to Marlow realizing Kurtz is only a man that has succumbed to his owndarkness and evil. Conrad's tone obviously points out the darkness of Kurtz andImperialism, but the darkness can even be seen in Marlow, as he doesn't believe inImperialism, but does nothing to stop its occurrence. Marlow never really sees wholebeings in the Africans either; he only describes limbs, eyes, and other features; never theAfricans as a whole human. Marlow also lies to Kurtz's Intended in the end, even thoughhe believes lying to be one of the greatest evils in man. Darkness can also be seen in allthe characters, as in the Central Station Manager who holds supplies from Kurtz in orderto kill him and take over his position. Really the whole novel is a metaphor for evil, as itdescribes the Imperialistic Inner Station as the heart of darkness and the Congo River asthe veins which spread this darkness throughout the body of Africa. Evil also becomesprogressively worse as Marlow moves closer to the heart of darkness, with some evil inthe Outer Station to more evil in the Central Station and finally to the most evil andcorruption at the heart of darkness, the Inner Station. Conrad clearly depicts that there isa darkness in all of us that stems from our hearts and knows no bounds."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I purchased this book for my 17 year old daughter.

I'm sure that it boggled the minds of so-called civilized intellectuals everywhere and made people think a little harder about the benefits of imperialism. But this book has little relevance anymore. The threat of colonization has far from subsided, I suppose, but in a world of 24-hour news stations, talk radio, and political personalities bombarding the media with their personal opinions, the issue has been overanalyzed and picked apart. Nothing new is presented in the book in this century, which is a real shame, because the writing is to many people very beautiful.The problem for me was not reading a tired diatribe about the horrors of civilization and humanity's common savagery. No, the problem was in the central metaphor, which I'm sure you can guess by reading the title. Again, maybe the symbol of light and darkness was new and exciting 100 years ago, but it certainly is not now. And it doesn't help that Conrad chose to make absolutely certain that even his dimmest readers couldn't miss his metaphor; his favorite words are \\"light,\\" \\"white,\\" \\"dark,\\" \\"black,\\" \\"haze,\\" \\"brooding,\\" \\"blinding,\\" \\"shadow,\\" \\"sun,\\" and \\"gloomy,\\" and he does not hesitate to overuse them. I cringe when I consider counting the amount of times I read the phrase \\"the impenetrable heart of darkness.\\" Plus, as the entire story is orally told by Marlow, the entire fact that he uses this overarching metaphor is unrealistic and only serves to make each mention of light and dark more irritating.

The introduction is a bit tedious and long describing in detail how Marlow decides to travel to Africa and how he gets there through his aunt's help. But by the second chapter I was intrigued and by the end of the novel it became my favourite book.Joseph Conrad is considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest writer of the English language and the funny thing is it is his third language (behind Polish and French). He decided to write &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in English because according to him English has words no other language has that he wanted to put in this novel.The book starts out on a steamboat on the Thames River where the narrarator is talking with a number of other folks on board. Marlow sits (like Buddha) nearby and just starts talking. He then becomes the central speaker and through the narrarator, Marlow's story is told. As a young lad he saw the Congo River and he became transfixed with it and decided one day he would go to Africa. When he becomes an adult his aunt gets him a job in Africa at a Central Station where the head manager manages the smaller stations that are bringing in ivory. Here is where the story hooks the reader. Out in the middle of the jungle is a man by the name of Kurtz. This man is greatly admired and hated at the same time because he is bringing more ivory than all of the stations combined, yet he is the only one out there excluding the Africans he took with him. He sends back any man who has been an assistant to him and the only word out is that he was considering coming back but turned his steamboat around and stayed out in the jungle. Marlow's job is to find him.The book is amazing and beautifully written. It is almost like a poem with outstanding word images and depth in the words. The theme of the novel is &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; In my opinion the novel is not so much on colonization in Africa as the theory of Conrad's that man is capable of anything and that when a person is out in the middle of nowhere they are capable of anything. Both Kurtz and Marlow are people to be admired, Marlow because he hates lies and the colonization and Kurtz because he always tells the truth. He knows what he did and that is why his last words are &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; He is the horror.The novel is a beautifully sculpted nightmare of what man is capable of. It is my favourite book and I think everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"English majors are justly fond of Conrad, who packs his stories with subtlety, symbolism, parallels, and rich imagery. &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is a brief and strangely absorbing read. Its plot is simple enough on the surface, about a sailor who guides a steamer up the Congo in search of a vaunted ivory trader. But beneath the surface, in a palpable atmosphere of unease, lie the book's complicated themes. This isn't just a condemnation of European activity in Africa, but a glimpse at the evil within every man. In some ways this book is a precursor to &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and other twentieth century books of despair, and yet Conrad does not leave the reader without hope. In skilful, mystical passages about light and dark, black and white, tall and short, jungle and sepulchre, Conrad gives us much food for thought about the nature of humankind and the possibilities for both good and evil. I see this book more as a warning than a simple cry of despair - though it pays ample attention to &quot;the horror&quot; of it all."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Author Originally from Poland, and known as Josef Konrad Korzeniowski, Joseph Conrad knew very little English until he began learning it at age 20. At age 38 he published the first of his many novels, and he displayed in each a rare mastery of his adopted language. A member of the British Merchants Navy, he worked his way from mere deckhand, to captain. While serving, he traveled widely, and entered the African Congo in 1890. It is thought that much of Heart of Darkness is based upon his experiences while there. His Message His overall message might be summed up in the clich&eacute;, Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It might also be summed up in the assertion that man's social environment is perhaps kingpin in either deterring or allowing release of the innate evil capable of flowing from his nature. The book addresses the themes of oppression and freedom, power and powerlessness, corruption and virtue, nature and nurture, in ways that are creative and profound. Overall, this book is deep. It's message only fully hit me after considerable private musing. In Heart of Darkness, Conrad explores human nature in a most ironic fashion. He does this by narrating an oral story as told by a seafaring man about an explorer-merchant who enters into the African Congo with the best of intentions of bringing light and commerce. But there in the Heart of Darkness, without any external restraint, would emerge the explorer-merchant's own heart of darkness...and the horrors that would ultimately flow from it. Is Conrad's book, at least in part, an autobiographical warning disguised as fiction? There is a strong universality and timelessness to the themes addressed in Heart of Darkness, and an extreme richness of meaning in the text. This coupled with the life of Joseph Conrad himself, in so profoundly addressing his issues of English literacy, makes this truly outstanding reading."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is one of those classics of literature that should be read by everyone. It is dark and deeply psychological.

But anyone can find \\"what is this book about\\" on many websites. THe Norton Critical edition is probably the best way to read Heart of Darkness.

Still, having only read it through once, I did get enough out of it to believe that further study will reveal some profound light in the heart of darkness. At only 100 odd pages, it does seem to have been designed by the author to be returned to again and again, small enough to swallow, but needing longer to fully digest.Some passages are genuinely quite unnerving, with a sense successfully conveyed of a man who has cut away the veneer of civilisation, looked into the soul of humanity, and seen something truly disturbing. In short, this book is about nihilism, about the flimsy and shifting world of language that alone seperates humanity from the other animals (but only in a delusory sense). As the previous reviewer noted, Kurtz's power is almost wholly cast by his words, a potency maintained even whilst barely existing as a decaying, dying body. The story juxtaposes the power of language, through the dense tale spun by Marlowe of the mythical but ultimately physically insubstantial Kurtz, with the raw natural savagery of the African jungle and its muscular and visceral inhabitants. Language is what seperates the human from the animal, but in the heart of darkness, language, and through it civilisation, is revealed to be a false god created ultimately to serve animal passions.Moreover, the novel contains the message that when man tries to shed his 'civilising' light on those judged to be savages, he merely succeeds in laying bare the moral emptiness of his own soul. Something to think about and to fruitfully connect with the war in Iraq, just as others did with Vietnam."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Many people call this novella, published in 1902, the first real book of the 20th century, in that it deals with loss of innocence, moral ambiguity, exploration of the subconscious - all issues that factored prominently into the past hundred years.In college I tried to read &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; but couldn't make it through, despite its small size. Conrad's thick prose just put me to sleep. But I recently read &quot;King Leopold's Ghost,&quot; a gut-wrenching book about the exploitation of the Congo around the turn of the century. With that book as factual background, I took another shot at &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; and this time I tore through it.The book works at a purely surface level, as an exotic adventure, but it's even more powerful when read as a symbolic journey - either to the core of an individual psyche or to the mysterious heart of the human condition. And what Marlow, the narrator, discovers there is enough to convince him that truly letting go - as Kurtz did - is to become immersed in a spiritual darkness that cannot be explained or escaped.&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (based loosely on &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;) introduced me to the phrase &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; - but reading it in Condrad's book was far more chilling."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When Kurtz exclaims \\"The Horror! The Horror!\\", it is in the same sense that we would also cry out if suddenly faced with the unshielded countenance of God. At the threshhold, just before we were either consumed, or absorbed, this too would be our cry.This most remarkable of books is a dissection of the Western psyche. We start with the capital city of the living dead in Europe itself. This is a land of sleepwalkers who have never awakened- they live out their lives spinning castles in the air that ultimately mean nothing. This is the state of the modern Western mind. Theory and profit, but no soul. On the journey down the African coast we encounter the European battleship antiseptically shelling the coast. These are tranplanted westerners hiding in the shells of their technological terrors while lobbing shells into the outer world- without really being contaminated by it (or so they hoped.) Then we reach the coast, where the high ideals preached in Europe are more and more obviously abandoned the farther inland one travels.When the land and the natives become \\"difficult\\", pure force and brutality are used to overcome and destroy. In other words, if they will not be \\"westernised\\", turned into copies of us, they must be obliterated. Preferably while making us a profit.Kurtz was a strong man. He was ambitious and powerful. Perhaps he kept up the charade of \\"civilising\\" the natives and the land in the name \\"progress\\" longer than anyone else. He kept up these empty lies until he penetraded to the deepest core of the primeval jungle. And then, this hollow shell of ideals and greed imploded. You see, as Conrad points out, Kurtz was fundamentally hollow. Yet Kurtz didn't just die, he was too strong. Instead, into that vacuum rushed the primal force itself. Kurtz became what he hated the most- he became the soul of the jungle- because he had none of his own. He became an \\"animal\\" in it's highest sense, a totally natural man. Indeed he became a natural King, as the native tribes recognised. He and the land were truly one.It is a mistake to judge Kurtz by the standards of the city of the dead. Kurtz and his warriors sweeping across the jungle, taking heads and ivory as trophies, was as natural as lions running down gazelles.... Far more natural than the hypocritical, brutal, soulless, enslavement of the coastal natives in the name of \\"civilisation\\"....."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is quite possibly the best book that I have ever read. I have read many books based on cultural differences and the effects on the people involved. Heart of Darkness explores the mind of an educated European as he travels to Africa. It is the story of a man named Marlow. Conrad has created a complex narrator in Marlow, a man who is not all good or all bad. He travels to Africa with a vague belief of the goodness behind the imperialist venture, but what he finds is totally opposite. He despises the destruction, greed, chaos, and inhumanity that he sees in Africa and begins to identify, through sympathy, with the &quot;savage&quot; natives, but he refuses to do anything to help them. He cannot rise above his European thinking that somehow the white man is superior. He returns from the Congo to Belgium and does nothing except to perpetrate the myth of the goodness behind European imperialism when he lies to Kurtz's Intended. At least the lies have a pure motive, in that, save the distraught fianc&eacute;.The novel has two separate settings. One, the frame narrative, is the setting for the telling of the tale on a cruising yawl (sailing vessel) or yacht on the Thames River near London, England. The second setting is that of the actual tale. In it, the protagonist travels to Brussels, the capital city of Belgium and home to the ivory company. Then to the Belgium Congo in Africa, with its dark, snaking, and mysterious river (in contrast to the tranquil Thames), and then back to Brussels.As a person, Marlow is a thirty-two year old seaman who has traveled extensively. His experience on the Congo River is a departure for him, for his travels are usually in salt waters. As a narrator, Marlow is unreliable in the sense that he is not an objective teller of the story, but is instead emotionally conflicted about the events and people within his tale. He is also a figure who is alienated from the mainstream. Unlike most Europeans who bought into the justifications for imperialism and saw it as a righteous cause, Marlow saw that it was nothing but greed. However, Marlow's ability to distance himself from the dominant thinking of the time does not fully free him from that kind of thinking. In the end, he accepts the injustice of imperialism by supporting the lies, which justify it.Heart of Darkness is structured as a journey of discovery, both externally in the jungle, and internally in Marlow's own mind. The deeper he penetrates into the heart of the jungle, the deeper he delves within himself; by the climax, when Kurtz has been revealed for the disgrace he is, Marlow has also learned something about himself. And he returns to civilization with this new knowledge.Marlow doesn't tell his tale straight through from beginning to end; he'll skip from an early event to a late event and back again. Thus, we get several pages about Kurtz- Marlow's impressions and evaluation of his behavior- close to the end of Chapter II, but Kurtz himself doesn't appear on the scene until some way into Chapter III.Conrad has created the character of Kurtz out of all the contradictions and madness of imperialism. Like Marlow, he is of European descent and is described as half-French and half- English. He is also described as a universal genius that is a great writer, painter, poet, orator, musician, and politician. Also like Marlow, Kurtz comes to Africa with noble intentions of doing good things for the Dark Continent. He believes that each station of the ivory company, for which he is an agent, should help the natives to a better way of life, but good (the light truth) and evil (the dark truth) split Kurtz's soul. Unfortunately, in the end he crosses over to live totally by the dark truth.On the level of words, Kurtz expounds on the ideals of altruism, progress, enlightenment, and kindliness in the European presence in Africa. On the level of actions, he ruthlessly kills Africans, steals their natural resources in order to forward his own goals for rising in the company and in the world, and presents himself as a deity to be worshipped by the natives. Marlow says Kurtz is insane mainly for the reason that he embodies this contradiction, but Kurtz has also been horribly neglected by the Manager and deprived of food and supplies for months, a situation that would drive any normal man to insanity. Whether Kurtz is actually insane at the time of his death is left open to speculation. Perhaps Marlow names him as insane simply because he has great difficulty dealing with the reality of the man.Some of the other minor, but important characters are: the Russian fool, the Intended, Director of Companies, Lawyer, Accountant, and the unnamed narrator. The Russian fool is a man known by his clothes with many colorful patches making him look much like a harlequin. He works with Kurtz who proves to be poor company for him. The Russian fool is an important foil to Kurtz, to help us understand his standards and goals. This in turn helps us understand Marlow more fully. The Intended is Kurtz's bride to be who at the end of the book still thinks that Kurtz was the great man that she remembered him to be and Marlow doesn't have the heart to tell her otherwise. The Director of Companies is a nameless captain on board the Nellie, one of Marlow's listeners. The Lawyer, Accountant, and unnamed narrator are nameless men on board Nellie. They are the listeners of Marlow's story. These men merely help to make the story possible and create dialogue outside of the story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I won't bother you with details about the book itself, beyond saying that it's a far easier read than a lot of other \\"classic\\" books you either suffered through (or avoided) during high-school or college. Joseph Conrad's native language wasn't English, and I think that shows in how he uses much simpler prose than a lot of other late Victorian authors--think of him more like a British Hemingway. This would be a great companion piece to a viewing of \\"Apocalypse Now\\", which, of course, was based upon this book.Be forewarned--if you're the politically correct type and offended by pejorative language, this book is not for you. Conrad uses the \\"N-Word\\" more than a Jay-Z download; you have to remember that he was a late 19th century European.Lastly, the cheap price for \\"direct from Amazon\\" for the Kindle isn't bad, but you can get it even cheaper (like, free) from Project Gutenberg, and then have Amazon convert the text file into a Kindle-friendly format.

After HOD, it will be fun to watch that movie again.Sentence by sentence, this book resonates with the sound of classic literature. I'm a fan of eloquent wordsmithery, and Conrad was a master. Having read this independently, I probably didn't pick up on all of the symbolism or social commentary about European colonialism. However, the essential themes are clear and persuasively shown: the corruption of power and the potential in humankind for regression to savagery when social inhibitions are absent - much like &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, which another reviewer astutely noted. Beyond the meanings, I think it works very well as a dark adventure narrative, building premonitions of disaster as Marlow journeys deeper into the continent and closer to the mythical Kurtz. My only criticism echoes many previous reviews: the encounter with a weakened Kurtz is anticlimactic and leaves the reader hungry for demonstrations of the great man's warped charisma."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book was difficult to follow based on today's prose.

I didn't read itas a selection from a summer required reading list. I guess the kids were just trying to wring every drop ofanything that could be construed as symbolism from the story. It is a dark story, about the evils of colonialismand the effect greed has on people.

Yet, it seems younger people - say those in their 20s and younger - have vastly inferior vocabularies. Are the school systems that poor these days?

I read this book and it has many qualities that european males find model behavior. The book is a great model for such people as King Leopold to just murder and kill over Five million Congolese with no remorse. The ideal thinking since these people throw spears.live in mud huts and have never achieved the things we have they don't deserve to breathe and walk the earth. The people have no emotions or state of awareness. The Europeans didn't realize that these people in the furture might have something to offer. This book in my opinion is a disguise for profaganda colonization and a justification. The very inaccurate thing in this book is the description of cannibalism which has never been proven other than overzealous missionary accounts to exist in Zaire. The book reminds of every thing the Europeans value,and that is murder,destruction,and dominance over other people. The real twist to this story is that the Belgium KIng Leopold was the real savage. He had African skulls laying around his castle as if it was a real big trophy and had regular incidents or murder fests where he would go into villages and kill helpless Bantus. The europeans have never cared about African people or their side of their story,they just put out novels and disguise them as classics to brainwash the general public. I recommend if you read this book,to take the time and read King Leopold's Ghost.

There is a group of men aboard an English ship that is sitting on the Thames. The group includes a Lawyer, an Accountant, a Company Director or you can call him a Captain, and a man without a specific profession called Marlow hes sortof unidentified through out the book. A ship that they are all on is called the Nellie. It's a cruise down the Thames it will rest there and wait in tide. The main point of this book is that Marlow the main character leaves Congo where the ship was going and it left everyone upset and looked at him as if he was going on the \\"dark side\\" Marlow says, the truth is \\"too dark\\" to tell. His bad decline is in vain if no one learns of it. This is completely the point of Marlow's telling the tale the people aboard the Thames River ship. Once led to civilization, now leads into darkness.If I was to rate this book from a 1 to 5 I would rate this book a 4 because it had a lot of detail and kept you interested and wanting to read more and more.

Without meaning it, Conrad gives us a good history lesson about colonialism. One thing I disliked about the book is how it was written. I keep reading about how well written this book is but I don't see how it can be viewed as well written. Even though it's only around 70 pages long it could have been much shorter. In many parts of the book Conrad explains the scenery, and what Marlow is experiencing, a little too much. This does give you a good picture of what's going on, but it also makes you lose interest. You find yourself wondering when something is going to happen. If you like a compelling story with elaborate descriptions and really gets your mind spinning, then this is a perfect book for you. If you just want the compelling story without the unnecessary (in my mind) descriptions then you should try another book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I picked up Heart of Darkness because I thought Apocalypse Now (not the Redux, which sucks) was a really good movie. As it turns out, there's little in common between the two.The story concerns Marlow, an Englishman, who takes a job ferrying ivory down a river in Africa. He becomes interested in Kurtz, another trader who has set himself up as a god over the tribes in this area.Heart of Darkness, again, has been elevated to that divine status of \\"English literature.\\" The same people who have promoted it thus have also attempted to explain away the novel's flagrant racism, although I don't know how that would be possible. How many English professors would be up a creek (you know which creek) if everybody suddenly figured out that authors like Conrad are overrated?Like The Secret Sharer, Heart of Darkness is boring and difficult to read. Conrad is one of those who liked sentences the size of paragraphs and paragraphs that went on for a page or more. Often, given his penchant for changing topics mid-paragraph, I did not see why he used half the paragraph breaks he did. The boringness of the novel is compounded by the Marlow's rambling narrative. Certainly, this helps define the personality of the character, but it certainly doesn't help the book's readability.Conrad presents the whole story as told as narrative by the main character after everything has taken place. Here, glaringly, Conrad's style doesn't work. \\"The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver - over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a somber gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur.\\" Obviously, people write like this, but nobody ever talked like this. You tell a story to an audience like this and every last one of them will be asleep.Conrad's work is highly symbolic. Far be it from me to say he was not a talented writer. But I think he, as well as those who cling to his coattails, have missed this: you can go to far with symbolism, and most any other literary device, and absolutely kill the story. While Conrad was busy creating vividly-descriptive sentences and cathedrals of paragraphs, the story fell by the wayside, and nobody went back for it.This is my problem. I don't want to see word pictures of nothing, no matter how lovely those pictures might be. Just tell me a story. If you can do both at once, so much the better. But if you're only going to have one, this is the wrong one to have.NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel is a testament to the fact that Joseph Conrad's first language was not english.

H. Auden (1907 - 1973)In general, I quite agree with Mr Auden. But there are exceptions. \\"Heart of Darknes\\"s by Joseph Conrad is one of them. It is a tragic example of very promising story ruined by atrocious writing. Why it is remembered, read, reviewed and praised is quite beyond me.Mr Conrad has all my sympathy. English is my second language, too, and I am very well aware how difficult it is to write it well. It's a very rich language and it's awfully easy to slip into mindless showing off your vast vocabulary. It's also a very elegant and eloquent language, so it's even easier to be carried away by the cleverness of your long and elaborate sentences. This is what Mr Conrad does constantly throughout this book. No amount of sympathy can help in this case.(Spoilers ahead!)I cannot help smiling when I read in the biographical note of this edition about Conrad's ''masterful narrative technique''. As a matter of fact, his narrative technique is the most commonplace and the laziest one possible. After a short introduction, a first person narrator introduces Marlow who proceeds to tell the whole story about his journey into the heart of darkness - literally the jungle of Congo, figuratively the mind of Kurtz - virtually without interruptions.Marlow is a simply terrible story-teller: rambling, ranting, preaching, digressing: wordy and prolix to the extreme. He is considerably helped by Mr Conrad's turgid, convoluted, ponderous, pretentious and affected prose. I am often left at sea what is happening, or indeed what has happened a page ago. Any dramatic drive that the story might possibly have is drowned into intolerable verbosity. Marlow's attempts at informal tone and humour are pathetic. They usually amount to something like the following mess:I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest - not because it occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you that just then I perceived - in a new light, as it were - how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not so - what shall I say? - so - unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that time.Any characters other than the Marlow-Conrad narrator emerge either as mindless chatter-boxes, such as the crazy Russian whose mind Kurtz has ''enlarged'', or as vague shadows so insubstantial that I can't make anything out of them - like Kurtz himself, for example. Marlow's appalling passion for stringing adjectives together tends to obscure his meaning rather than to clarify it. The whole characterisation - if it may be thus called - is so completely over-the-top, that it's impossible to take it seriously. Consider this passage about the ''crazy Russian'':\\"I looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in motley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous. His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and altogether bewildering. He was an insoluble problem. It was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remain - why he did not instantly disappear.\\"See what I mean by showing off your vocabulary? The same exhausting prolixity pervades every single page and makes the book nearly unreadable. It all sounds like the worst example of the so called ''stream of consciousness''. (A very stupid term in the first place. What's the rest of fiction: a stream of unconsciousness?) Is this what makes Mr Conrad ''modern'' and ''influential''? Well, it also makes his unbearably tedious.But let that pass. Let us assume one is willing to put up with the horrid writing until the end. Let us assume that all the effort and the patience would be rewarded in the end. Nothing doing. The book remains a complete failure.After the horrendous writing, the most serious fault of this book is that it never fulfills the hopes that something significant might finally turn up. We are told a number of times that Kurtz is a remarkable man. Clearly, that's true. He had managed to collect lots of ivory, apparently at great personal risk. He had played God among the natives who obviously worship him. He had ''enlarged the mind'' of the Russian. He had made a woman in England fall - and remain - madly in love with him. Last and most important of all, he has been a source of endless fascination for Marlow during the whole trip. So far, so good.But Mr Conrad never tells us anything more. He never answers the questions why? and how?, he doesn't even suggest any answers. During the last thirty pages we finally meet the emaciated Kurtz, now dying, and there are several vivid descriptions of his looks and behaviour. But it's the same sham rhetoric and nothing of any consequence is said! Has he gone insane or is he supremely sane? How did he subject the local natives to his will? Why? What are the reasons for his final ''The Horror! The Horror!''? What did he say to impress that Russian so much? What are his \\"great ideas\\"? Why is Marlow so terribly fascinated with him? We are never told. The closest the narrator ever comes to at least suggesting something is yet another chunk of worthless rhetoric:\\"Since I had peeped over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness. He had summed up - he had judged. 'The horror!' He was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candor, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth - the strange commingling of desire and hate. And it is not my own extremity I remember best - a vision of grayness without form filled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all things - even of this pain itself.\\"To say that this is woefully inadequate is an understatement. It sounds like politician's or preacher's speech. \\"Truth\\", \\"belief\\", \\"conviction\\" - and nothing more specific. The promising conversation with the woman that ends the book is equally bogus. ''I loved him - I loved him - I loved him!'' And that's that. What was so remarkable and lovable about Kurtz remains a profound mystery to me. There is nothing on which to base even the most tentative hypothesis.Now, I don't mind a writer's leaving me to erect the building. But I do insist on his laying the foundations. Especially if we are going to build a skyscraper together. Mr Conrad wants to build something truly spectacular, perhaps one of those futuristic wonders in Dubai. But his foundations are very shaky indeed!It's difficult to find anything redeeming about this book. The best about Mr Conrad's fabled ''narrative technique'' is that he delays as much as he can the appearance of Kurtz. But that's the obvious thing to do. And the few bits we learn about him in advance are lost in a simply enormous amount of irrelevant episodes, all described with the same passion for detail, and in the same awkward and mannered style, that drives me insane.Now and then there are moments when Mr Conrad's rhetoric does not altogether misfire, and he manages to create an evocative atmosphere or to stimulate contemplation of history and human nature. For example:\\"It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests - and that never returned.\\"\\"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress\\"\\"Droll thing life is - that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.\\"\\"No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.\\"But this is by no means enough. Fiction is - or at least should be - more than a random collection of haphazard opinions, personal observations and poetic images. And such flashes of brilliance are firmly in the minority: tiny oases in the middle of the vast desert of shattering mediocrity.The book could have been great. Mr Conrad merely had to shorten it at least three times, delete at least half of the adjectives, and reveal anything, however little, of Kurtz's mind and personality. Instead, he throws at his readers a hideously purple and nearly incoherent narrative. When you strip away the verbiage there is nothing inside. It's an empty shell. Mr Conrad was either incapable or unwilling to add some substance to the laboured rhetoric. So the great theme about the madness of man amidst hostile environment remained thoroughly unexplored.Apart from two short stories, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" was my first serious venture into the writing of Joseph Conrad. I am not at all sure it won't be the last. Looking at his other, and much thicker, books on my shelves - The Secret Agent, Lord Jim, and a volume with three sea tales - fills me with repulsion. It's a terrible thing to make it through a book at the cost of great exhaustion - physical and mental - and then to realise that the only thing you remember is the sheer effort it took. That's exactly what happened to me with Heart of Darkness. It wasn't worth it.There must be something special, relevant and profound in Joseph Conrad, not least because he and his works made an enormous impression on no less a man than Bertrand Russell (who, incidentally, declared \\"Heart of Darkness\\" to be his favourite). But whatever this \\"something\\" may be, it is inaccessible to me.On the other hand, Somerset Maugham was rather critical and in this case I couldn't agree more with his remark that Conrad wrote mostly short stories, but his natural verbosity expanded them into novels. Conradians of course consider the remark nasty, but for me it is pure wisdom. For \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is neither a novel nor a novella. It's a short story extended way beyond its reasonable limits at the expense of the densest and dullest prose imaginable. Worst of all, the colourful skin has no flesh beneath.P.S. A note on Conrad's racism that has outraged so many readers. Frankly, I don't see what all fuss is about. Mr Conrad is fond is using words like ''savages'' for describing the natives and he obviously doesn't think much of them. But it's nothing terrible at all. In fact, there is a grudging admiration for the natives as natural masters of these hostile lands, similar to the tribute Maugham - another writer often, and even more unjustly, accused of racism - paid them in his short story ''P. & O.'' There is even a hint of affection as regards the dead helmsman.Furthermore, symbolically, Kurtz's alienation from his own \\"tribe\\", and finally his deportation, actually suggests a decidedly anti-colonial attitude. In a way, the White Man is unable to conquer the real masters of the jungle. He has been vanquished, by the climate or by his own weaknesses, it doesn't matter.Anyway, racism is a very minor issue not worth bothering about. The book has far bigger shortcomings than a few slighting (and typical for the time of writing) references to coloured people.I remember vividly a photograph from one of my high-school's history textbooks showing an Englishman at leisure and an Indian attending to him with a big fan. The caption quotes the former saying something like ''We are gentlemen entrusted with the noble task of governing an inferior race.'' Now that's racism, the most blatant and odious type of it. There is nothing like that in Conrad, not in \\"Heart of Darkness\\" at any rate."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The hypersensitivity generated within the hallowed corridors of a largely left-wing academe has called into question the value of what is--by any *aesthetic* standard--an inarguably great book. (This book has even been condemned as &quot;racist&quot; by Nobel laureate Chinua Achebe!) One has to question the judgment of a critic who uses his own, modern political sensibilities to judge a work of art--or, in the case of Heart of Darkness, to *misjudge* it.This novella is uncharacteristically brief and focused. Compare this to some of Conrad's other works, like &quot;The Nigger of the Narcissus,&quot; or &quot;Nostromo,&quot; and you'll better appreciate the mastery with which Conrad has compressed a story of such grand thematic scope into so small a space. Very, very few writers have been able to do this. What is the book about? Man's inherent inclination towards barbarity. This is something the books race-critics seem to miss: Granted, there are NO AFRICAN MILLIONAIRE PHYSICISTS in this novel! But who are the true barbarians, here? The white men. The Imperialists. &quot;Mistah&quot; Kurtz represents the apotheosis of this &quot;imperialistic degeneracy,&quot; a focused portrait of self-interested barbarism, which in his case is tragically ironic, because in trying to turn his back on the bloody impulse of colonial expansion, he has slipped, become a monster himself, without hope of redemption. His slide into moral degradation taints all around him--inluding the narrator, Marlowe--just as the moral degradation of colonial expansionism destroys what it touches.So in what ways does it really matter, for instance, that the native Aficans are portrayed as so-called savages? What exactly does that even mean? What was a savage to the Victorian sensibility, but someone less cultured, uneducated? Within the milieu of Conrad's Victorian British audience, his position could fairly be called radical, and his portrayal of the natives and their sad plight uncommonly compassionate. Should we impose our social standards retroactively when critiquing works of art? Or should we gauge the writer's accomplishment on its own terms? To do otherwise would be to advocate discarding Oscar Wilde's art because he was a pedophile; ditto with Socrates. To complain about alleged racism in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, magificent work of art, is to miss the point entirely."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"An adventure into deepest, darkest Africa . . . An expos&eacute; of the evils of European Imperialism . . . A deep, introspective look into the recesses of one's own soul and character . . . \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a novel which deals with these three complexities in an interesting, enjoyable, and thought-provoking manner.Joseph Conrad's classic is, on the surface, a novel which chronicles the adventures of Marlow as part of a Belgian Congo \\"trading\\" company, and his pursuit for the larger-than-life Kurtz. However, it delves into the hypocrisy of Imperialism, the darkness in one's soul, and the relative meaning of insanity. Although the naked savagery and cruelty of the Europeans toward the Africans is exposed, particularly in the \\"Grove of Death,\\" Marlow's more pressing concerns are with the effect that Imperialism has upon the \\"civilized\\" individual. By all accounts, Kurtz was a model citizen in Europe and of utmost regard, bounded by the social norms and mores of the rigid European society. Yet, when he plunges into the jungles of Africa, the previous social norms which bounded him are now broken, and his soul has infinite freedom. It is in this environment of limitless freedom that the soul will undoubtedly veer toward the dark abyss of one's inner being. Truly, Kurtz has been horrified about what has become of him, and Marlow shudders at the potential fate of his own soul.Although this novel exposes the hypocrisy and savagery of Imperialism, it does not regard the native Africans in a high light, either. Although Marlow certainly displays compassion toward the \\"savages\\" and is the most sympathetic toward them, he still views them as mere inhuman objects. At times, Marlow seems to be more concerned about the inefficiency and wastes of the colonial system, than of the welfare of the natives. But at least Marlow exposes the hypocrisy of the Europeans who claim to \\"civilize the savages,\\" but are interested in nothing more than their own wealth and self-interest.For the PC crowd, the Offend-o-Meter is pretty high. The native Africans are stereotyped as savages and cannibals who believe in witchcraft and sorcery. They are regarded as ignorant and superstitious and inferior to the Europeans, even by Marlow. Women are regarded as out of touch with reality, and merely objects for a man's affection and wealth. And of course ivory is hunted and is celebrated in abundance. But I think these can be dismissed as a relic of its era.Overall, this is a great book that not only explores European Imperialism, but also the depths of one's inner soul. And although Imperialism isn't soundly rejected, it still provides an interesting study for the prevailing wisdom of the time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness is a dark, profound, and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in Africa. If you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you. Conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel looking for a great adventure story I would say that I wasted my time, but looking at in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization, I would say this is one of the most significant novels I have ever read. Because of the fact that I read this novel in my English class, and we analyzed every page, I think I appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment. I am not going to lie, this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. The movie on the other hand I found tiresome and boring. The movie, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" comes no where near giving the book justice. The movie left out many key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story. If you are having difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel then the movie might be a good recourse but I would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"That may very well be an apt alternate title for Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. There is something so intense about the legend of Kurtz, about the mythologized rumor of a White Man of heightened civilization plunging headfirst into the purest and most naturalistic of the human abyss. The Jungle, that lost and unexplored place where all the benefits of wealth or education are washed away in the murky hindsight of the thrill of survival. Heart of Darkness explores that taste, that bitter residue left in the mouth after struggling up to our feet and building a modern world around all this unchanging nature. It speaks far into the past of that natural root, that call it poison or call it cure which once grew so feral on the yet to be tamed planet earth. God was more of an idea then, not so much a broken apart and compartmentalized Super-Being that ruled benevolently over a variety of chosen faiths. Here is the bubbling foundation of the beginnings of organized belief.For Kurtz is God, or at least 'a god', who's myth has grown so spectacular that even reality will not crush his lingering worship. Heart of Darkness is a story of words put into action (Kurtz is a preacher who has somehow mastered the technique of converting his listeners). The words are The Idea, the marginalizing of God into a single aspect, with a face plastered on and a motive and agenda made perfectly clear. Kurtz is this God, this Holy Messiah and pained Anti-Christ. Conrad is attacking not religion but belief itself. He attacks humbling one's self, attacks humility at the core by exploring the myth of a man who struggles with neither. Marlow merely questions (Marlow always questions) and tends to seek ways to expose the foul stench of the absolutes of faith.Kurtz is not a hero and yet is to be admired. He comes across, at times, as a cross between a benevolent slave-master and a bloody-thirsty ivory trader. He is every good and every bad of all the extremes combined. Such is not the very middle but is a world waiting to explode.Heart of Darkness is not about blasphemy, is not about tragedy or sadness, about darkness and light. Heart of Darkness is about the death of the human soul. It only seeks to discover what caused the destruction of humanity. Conrad seems, in most of his work, to take no sides with anything and so cannot be said to be suggesting a new way to live. All he does is expose, in a frequently crippling fashion, many of our modified or wholly mythologized most sacred and holy beliefs."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"That's exactly what the first 50 pages are like. If you can get over the repetitive, redundant, and trite, albeit well-written prose that incessantly and needlessly describes to no end the Congo River and the ship, then the last 22 pages are worth the sacrifice. During the beginning, there is little or no character development. In fact, I was hoping someone or something would jump out of \\"the heart of darkness\\" and kill them all - they were unendearing and useless simpletons. Having said that, Conrad punches through the uqiquitous, lugubrious(a word he used entirely too much), morose, and morbid fog that permeates the heart of darkness on the Congo as well as the metaphorical heart of darkness residing in the inscrutable and mysterious Mr. Kurtz to provide a meaningful and strong finale. Worth the buck."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"There is one reason to read this book, and that is if you want to experience a waking nightmare.Conrad's book is the simple story of a man witnessing mad horror, writ large and scary. The prose itself is not worthwhile; much like a dream, it wages a losing battle with coherency, and ultimately is almost unreadable. However, as Marlow maundered on and on about The Darkness, The Gloom, and so on and so forth, Conrad somehow managed to instill a sense of mad, fearful anticipation me. There is no reason to be afraid, and every once in a while I would stop, blink, and realize the preceding text was stupid. However, reading each word, I couldn't *help* but agree with Marlow that something *felt* terribly wrong.The very idea of writing which can force a reader to experience subtle changes in disposition would be worth 3 and a half stars to me, but like so many nightmares, this book bubbles and builds, and finally never goes anywhere.

My, isn't that inspiring and uplifting? The 'depth' of this book is discovered only as one looks for depth in a pond and mistakes the reflection as depth. This book is a thin veneer covering a lack of creativity due to Conrad using up all his good material in earlier writings. This book should not be combined with alcohol or other depressants.

It starts off very dry with long descriptive dialect that really put me asleep in the beginning, but later gets very interesting. Heart of Darkness is a story of an outer journey, which reflects an inner spiritual quest of our hero. There is much we don't know about our souls, which is what the story is about. Kurtz was a great man(my favorite character) who was some how corrupted by the power he gained during his trip into the Congo. But following the same river Kurtz took, Marlow is able to trace the experiences Kurtz has and had a completely different result. In other words, Marlow takes the same dangerous route but does not fall prey to the same temptations, which corrupted Kurtz. He managed to withdraw his step from being a savage. I hate how Kurtz dies at the end."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The nightmare of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is found in its stark portrayal of madness under the influence of an environment filled with desolation. Its protagonist, Mr. Kurtz, is raised amongst civilized people, adapts virtues that were regarded proper in society during the Victorian era, yet when he travels into the Congo, where these qualities are of no consequence, he abandons them to become wild. To understand how Kurtz fell to this emotional corruptness, a reader must be aware of three main elements that cause his disillusionment: power, greed, and isolation.When Kurtz was living in England, he was a follower of the island's ruling party and conducted tasks amongst the supervision of its magistrates. Under these conditions, most of his actions were in abidance with the law, and if he were found conducting himself improperly in society, a harsh punishment in the form of fines or imprisonment for activities against the state could result. With his voyage into the Congo in the obtainment of a fortune through ivory trade, the lack of ruling parties in these far-flung outposts has an immediate effect on his persona. He discovers as he travels further into the interior of Africa, that lawlessness grows as the watchful eyes of government factions fade away into the nothingness of primeval jungles. Many individuals thrown into an environment where they find unbridled freedom will seek means of overpowering others, and as Mr. Kurtz finds himself the sole member of intelligence amongst a province populated by heathens, he seeks ways to gain rule. When Marlow arrives to bring Kurtz back to civilization, the ivory trader has become supreme ruler over most of the land's inhabitants and has brainwashed the people into following his whims. He gains power over the natives through his ruthless treatment of traitors, putting their heads on stakes, his disregard for English customs, and failure to adhere to the application of a well-bred indoctrination into the mindset of his people. He encourages savagery, for he understands people bred from the wild will only follow those who enforce nature's unwritten code. He grows so favorable towards his position as ruler over the jungle that when he discovers Marlow is coming to take him back to civilization, a place where he has no control, he tries to stop him and dispatches natives to massacre all the passengers on the steamer. Marlow survives the onslaught and takes Kurtz away from a place he believes has deranged the man's mind but has actually offered him a gift so many people seek in life: control over the masses.Ivory in an insurmountable supply creates greediness in Kurtz. He is renown in the Congo for his expertise in the ivory trade, and no one can match his production. Boatloads of the valuable commodity are sent downstream, bringing him handsome profits, yet when he achieves financial success the glamour of wealth becomes false to him. He begins to see his business not through what he can get for his product but in how much he can produce. Money is not needed in the jungle, and Kurtz goes out on hunting expeditions not to earn profits but to possess ivory in massive numbers, for he finds gratification in ownership of these valuable items. Kurtz's greed is shown in his desire to kill a Russian friend unless he returns ivory stolen from a personal stock and through his continuous, almost mindless ventures into the jungle for more supply. What purpose does his life serve while being taken up in this melodramatic pursuit of materialistic gain?The jungle, in its loneliness and impenetrability, drives Kurtz to a mental regeneration. He has lived away from England and its cultured people for many years and his separation from society awakens the chained beast within him. All men come from the primeval and carry from their earliest ancestors a propensity for wildness. How this wildness comes out in obverse behavior, depends on a person's condition, state of affairs, or environment, and when Kurtz comes to Africa, all of these factors play against etiquette, so he allows the jungle to take control of him. The characters in the book regard this abrupt change in Kurtz as madness, but would not a prisoner of any social standing put behind bars for a long period of time suffer a change in his or her mental makeup? Kurtz is not driven mad but has formed a closer bond with his surroundings, and through this friendship, has survived years of solitude and contact with unpredictable savages. It would be true to surmise he could never survive in England with his current mental instability, but the same could be said of a tiger, which could outlive any unarmed lawyer in the wild.When we come to the end of the story, we wonder if Kurtz's actions and words are not stupid mutterings from a lunatic but held a meaning beyond reason. He utters before his death the powerful words which have been memorialized in further works of literature and a film adaptation of the book set in Vietnam. Is this final cry against life a disgust for what he has become in the Congo? The reader can make his or her own conjectures upon the meaning of these words, but in the story, it is certain, through Kurtz's big plans for life and his universal ideas toward improving the future that he wishes for immortality. Maybe he discovers how useless personal gain, greed, and betterment over others are in the end when all that invites us is death. Marlow understands this when he recounts the story of Kurtz onboard a cruising yawl to a materialist who may be unaware that his respectable position in society and his economy will mean nothing if he died the next day. Then there arises the supposition of Kurtz's imperialistic tendencies having an association to his fateful words. Before he utters his final disgust upon the unfairness of life through its inevitable end in death, the reader is shown through the crippled man's mad control over the natives, the propensities of a conquering magistrate whose existence is centered on the exploiting of lower denizens on foreign soil. In this representation of a domineering controller of inferior members in a country not of his own nationality, his actions are reminiscent of the imperialists living in his era, who despised death, yet Kurtz's mind set, in other ways, could be seen as nihilistic, for from Kurtz there is a blatant disregard for civilization, law, and the substance of life. It is almost impossible to generalize Kurtz under a political label, but the reader discovers he has become one with the jungle, wild and untamed.If Kurtz is a nihilist or an imperialist gone native, what is Marlow? Marlow is introduced in the story as a wanderer, who looks at life not for what he can get in the means of materialistic gain or private ownership of commodities to suit his egoism, but for its natural experiences. As a sailor who has spent most of his life on the sea, without a home or a family to call his own, his opinions on life reflect the futility of finding substance in civilized society. He regards cities like Gravesend, a city that sends thousands of ships out to reap the benefits of foreign colonies, as one of the darkest places on earth. These qualities, although inherent of an anti-capitalist, do not make Marlow a Marxist. Yes, Marlow regards the bourgeoisie, represented by the crew accouterment of the lawyer and accountant, as loathsome creations of capitalism, his affiliation with socialism vanish in an expressive disregard to all government precepts through an inherent nihilism that grow out of his experiences with Kurtz. Before he meets this mystic man, Marlow is an average adventurer, probably of independent political affiliation, searching for the meaning of his existence, and he discovers from rumors by other traders and outpost attendants in his trek through the Congo that Kurtz holds the answer to his purpose in life. Yet when he does meet him, only more confusion arises. Although Marlow gets no answers, his regard for civilization and its learned denizens rise to a fervid abhorrence, and by the end of the book we find this simple sailor more confused and distraught about his personal existence than at the time he started his journey into the abyss.The meaning of Heart of Darkness can be generalized as humanities breaking away from a cave dwelling past to advance and destroy the earth with concrete materialism. The book could be used as a foretelling of our eventual demise, an end which could come in many forms yet not is limited to technology replacing us, nuclear holocaust, class struggles, and human wrought disintegration of the ecosystem."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Not really about anything.

Through the influence of a female relative in a \\"sepulchral city\\" in Europe, he receives the desired appointment-which eventually proves a nightmare. Hired by a competitive and exploitive company Marlow congratulates himself on his ability to explore a long river as a steamboat pilot.Marlow's dream of personal glory soon pales beside the related exploits of the Company's legendary Kurtz, whose larger-than-life influence instills awe and dread in all white men, the natives from whom he obtains tusks, and even two dissimilar women. Privately determined to meet and judge this prodigy for himself, Marlow sets out into the deep, gloomy and lowering heat of the interior. But Africa is jealous to give up both her ivory and her insidiously noxious influence over \\"civilized\\" white men.The story opens painfully slowly, as a chastened Marlow recounts his African adventure to three passengers on a ship awaiting the tide in the Thames. Readers gradually realize that Marlow's personal dream has devolved into a personal nightmare which will haunt him all his days. Ignoring the subtle, then more obvious warnings, Marlow plunges eagerly into his African enterprise, confident in his own abilities to survive and prosper. As the pace of events and revelations increases, however, we realize that Marlow is in imminent peril-not only his person, but his very soul. How can he salvage himself when so many others have sold out or sacrificed their morality?Despite the delayed stage entrance of the compelling figure, this is really the story of an enigmatic figure named Kurtz who possesses a remarkable ability with words, yet is driven by his own private demons to amass the most ivory of any of the Company's agents. Ah, but at what price? Why do men either worship or despise him? Marlow privately offers to serve as the impartial judge of the man's arresting character. A legend in Marlow's mind before they ever meet, Kurtz inspires reverence in the natives, envy in other managers and lasting passion in two diverse women.But has Kurtz succumbed to the irresistible form of jungle fever, whereby white men sell their souls as a result of prolonged heat, exotic settings and barbaric native customs? Marlow awaits the grand encounter with frenzied eagerness-predisposed to honor this trading prodigy. The title refers both to the dark milieu of interior Africa itself--which seems to suck the life and moral health out of white men--as well as to the Kurtz's own private torment re his narcissistic power and mania for Company glory. Introspective Marlow barely salvages his own moral sanity, but in Europe proves doggedly faithful in preserving Kurtz's reputation intact. A compelling read based on Conrad's own Congo experiences, which might have served as a warning to many individuals contemplating life and lucre on the Dark Continent."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"A fascinating account of colonial barbarism. Probes the underbelly of so-called modern European &quot;progress&quot; and the misapprehension of the nineteenth century's &quot;civilising&quot; mission in Africa. Written with verve and surprising insight and well ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I really didn'y like this book. I did understand all of the historical references and the exposure of human nature. Despite all of that interesting stuff, it was boring and a bit slow. No, I am not some stupid child. I am an Advanced Placement student, I am in a very hard English class. I happen to think this is a poor choice for required reading. I don't need to read the book again, I am assured that won't make it any better."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is a tale of a boat trip up the Congo, although nowhere in the book is the actual name of that river or the Belgian colony that emerged on its banks ever used. The writer, Joseph Conrad, was probably more interesting than any of his characters. Although writing about stiff-upper-lip types and managing to be more English than the English, he was actually born in a country that was undergoing its own form of colonization in those days, that is Poland. Going to sea, Conrad experienced many adventures around the globe, providing him with the rich stock of stories that were to win him acceptance from the English reading public.Most people now come across this book as part of some college course condemning colonialism. At least that's how I came across it. Others might know it as the prototype for Francis Ford Coppola's amazing movie &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot;Although an enthralling read, it is also a strangely vacuous book and, as a consequence, extremely well-named, as Kurtz, the central character, remains a dark enigma at the heart of the story to the end. We never really get to know who he is. Sent by the Belgian colonial authorities upriver, Kurtz has 'gone native' and our narrator is sent after him to investigate.This format allows the narrator to drop-feed us information about Kurtz during the long river voyage, giving us pieces of a jigsaw that is never completed. As we read we are nevertheless tantalized by the prospect of meeting the man who has scrawled &quot;Exterminate all the brutes&quot; on his report for the &quot;International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs,&quot; participated in &quot;unspeakable rites,&quot; and established his authority among the natives through the uncivilized practice of impaling heads on poles.Is this a true picture of colonialism? During his life as a sailor, the writer visited the Belgian Congo so the details ring true. Also the objective, descriptive, and rather emotionally detached style of the narrator proves convincing. Nevertheless there is something rather mechanical about this picture. Conrad presents economic exploitation or vicious greed as the dominant if not the only force in this view of colonialism. Perhaps in the case of the Belgian Congo, a particularly brutal colonial system, this is justified, but those college students being fed this novel as representative of colonialism in general should be more wary.To our modern materialistic sensibilities, it makes perfect sense that colonialism should be so greed-driven, but there were also more altruistic motives at work such as the desire to 'save,' 'educate,' and 'civilize' the natives. Conrad treats these with a healthy dose of cynicism. The philanthropic motives, sincerely believed by many in the home country, such as Marlow's Aunt, become in the face of the ruthless greed and brutality existing in the Congo no more than empty jargon, ironically spoked to justify the terrible cruelties inflicted on the natives for the benefit of the Company. But quite often these motives were actually sincere and brought great improvements to the natives, in many cases actually giving them the tools with which they later won their independence.Although condemning their exploiters, Conrad has little real understanding of the natives who always remain mysterious and unfathomable:&quot;The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us - who could tell? We glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.&quot;In this there is a lack of true sympathy, which however reassures us that he is not exaggerating or sentimentalizing the plight of the Africans. Colonialism was certainly not a blessing; maybe it wasn't a mixed blessing, but it might have been a mixed curse. Anyway, however you choose to view it, it undoubtedly had a profound impact on the economy, environment, culture, and identity of native peoples. We get little of this from Conrad and his &quot;unfathomable savages.&quot;"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is one of those books everyone tells you to read before you die. After finally sitting down to read it, I couldn't help but ask \\"Why?\\" Heart of Darkness is supposed to be about a man confronted by the darkness of the human soul, yet the closest we get to this is the villain moaning \\"the horror\\" repeatedly. Speaking of villains, throughout the novel the reader is informed that Kurtz, the ivory poacher and main villain, might have finally slipped off the deep end and is committing atrocities against the natives. Whether this is true or not is left unanswered since once the main character finally confronts Kurtz the story pretty much ends. This is the biggest disappointment of HoD: that it is never really clear what exactly is happening. It is a big confused mess and wastes the subject matter's vast potential."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Good short story, but I didn't find it to be great literature.

However, Conrad seems to have a low view of African people and a shallow portrayal of them (in contrast with his rich psychological insight into the European characters), which is disappointing, even if to be expected for Conrad's era. And although the imagery and use of language is wonderful, I hardly recognized in it the beautiful country of Congo that I know."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel is very different from the novels I have read in the past. It was a difficult read, and the reading was condensed into three chapters. The novel itself is full of struggles. The main character Marlow, has always had a strong desire to travel in order to \\"fill in the blanks\\" of the unknown. His main desire was to travel to Africa to the \\"snake-like\\" river, the Congo. He travels during the time of imperialism. When thinking about imperialism I always think about the negatives associated with it. Marlow however is idealistic about European control in Africa. He wants to believe that there is goodness in the white presence in Africa. Africa is often considered \\"The Dark Continent\\" so he thinks that imperialism is a good thing and that its purpose is to help and civilize the barbaric Africans. He also believes that Kurtz (who he has not met) represents the good of imperialists. Once Marlow arrives in Africa however, he realizes that the Europeans are selfish, materialistic, and brutal. Reality has kicked in that European imperialism in Africa is total greed and evil. Marlow still thinks that Kurtz symbolizes the idealistic and he therefore keeps his faith in humanity. The novel however ends realistically showing man's inhumanity. Marlow loses hope and he finally learns the truth about Kurtz. He comes to realize that Kurtz is insane, and greedy. Marlow also realizes that the only motive for imperialism is greed, evil, and triumph, and that there was never a pure motive. Marlow does not accept what he has learned as the truth. He wants to believe that their is goodness in mankind. This to me is ironic. Marlow does not speak well of the Africans. When he first gets to the Congo, his descriptions are of ill nature. Africa seems like a \\"dark\\" place. He shows feeling of superiority, being white and a male. The language used in this novel is very critical. It degrades both Africans and women. I also think it is ironic that Marlow does not think that women are capable of handling the truth, yet he himself does not want to accept truth and reality. He does not accept the truth about imperialism, Kurtz, and most importantly himself.Although I found the novel to be a bit difficult, I enjoyed it. The complexity of the novel is what drew me into it. There are many issues and it is interesting for me to read about them from the point of view of the author who has been accused of being a racist. The struggles, and the actual story was fascinating to me in a mysterious way. I also really like the title chosen for this novel. It adds so much more to the story and to the imagination of the audience. When reading the novel I picked up so many different meanings of it. The title and the story itself can be interpreted in many different ways. The reality, imperialism, the explored river, the language, the feelings expressed, as well as the inhumanity and ignorance of man all work together to compose the story and the title."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad takes us deep into the mind of the insane Kurtz who is being rescued by Marlowe. Away from society, Kurtz has become a sort of savage. Overwhelmed by his newly found, self created sense of power, we find that he turns out to be the exact opposite of the highly intelligent, well respected man Marlowe had expected to find. We are forced to see that danger, &quot;the horror&quot; lies within each and every human being, and if not contained this horror gets the best of us, making it impossible to better ourselves"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"My English teacher can't stop praising this book and how Conrad shows us the very center of the heart of darkness of humanity. I don't know, I understood the book but it was boring, a drag of read, and it had no story line. It is a useless novel that absolutely does not enhance my knowledge of anything. It's probably one of the worst books I've ever read because modernist writers think that a book can't be good if it's not brain crushingly complex and boring. This applies to Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse too. Unless you are forced to read it or you have to know what the hype is all about, don't read it, it's a novel that you can live without. I can't say that about The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway or books by Carol Shields. Oh well it's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Yes, there is an important point to this novel, but you have to dig so deep in order to find it. It is obvious that Conrad was afraid to really speak his mind because of the controversy and instead he walks a fine line between imperialism and it's victims. Instead he wrote a colections of useless words which are nothing more than giberish. This book had potential."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"The horror! The horror!\\"--Kurtz's last words or the reader's thoughts during Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness? Somehow Conrad makes the one hundred pages of Heart of Darkness feel like three hundred. It could be the thin story which is dragged out too long. The constant stream of unnecessarily complex vocabulary does not help the book either. Overall, Heart of Darkness leaves the reader feeling bored and insulted by the simple extended metaphor of the dark jungle and human morals.The story is told by Marlow, Conrad's alter ego. He rambles about his experience as captain of a merchant ship and meticulously explains every detail of its trip up a jungle river. This is painfully slow to read, but does build tension as the expedition gets closer to its final destination, a man named Kurtz. Kurtz is a legend among the workers in the ivory trade, and the reader's curiosity is provoked by the rumors told about him. In the end Marlow has to confront Kurtz and his own beliefs of human morality.Quite possibly the worst part of Heart of Darkness is Conrad's grotesque overuse of gaudy terminology. Most sentences are clogged with bizarre words that only cause the reader to misinterpret the text. This makes the novel highly inaccessible to any reader that is not of higher education. Conrad's writing is dated, making his point come across less clear than it may have one hundred years ago.Heart of Darkness makes a disturbing point about human corruptibility. However I feel the effectiveness of this point is lost in the length of the novel. While the raw lack of humanity is moving, I found myself too bored to care for the majority of the novel. Heart of Darkness should have been a short story. I was captivated by Kurtz at the end of the novel, but it may have just been my knowledge that the conclusion was near. Joseph Conrad wrote a powerful story, too bad it is so verbose and lingering that it drives back possible readers."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad is about a journey down to the Congo in search of a man by the name of Kurtz. This is an adventure story. Heart of Darkness was a denser reading then I am use to. The style of the book was different from the books I normally read and I think that may be why I had some trouble. The paragraphs are all really long and the author tries to throw a lot of ideas at the reader all at once. The book is written in flash backs and the main character seems to ramble on and on about things that could have been kept out of the book. There are a lot of symbols for the \\"darkness\\" in the story. There are many disturbing pictures created with the words one will read in this book. There are Cannibals and heads chopped off in this reading. One has to read very close to get the actual idea of what \\"darkness\\" means. It is a very intense reading. I did however like how the main character, Marlow, was so proud of his journey and how he followed his dreams and went out on this journey. This reading just takes a lot of patience and time to read so if one has both the time and the patience this could be a good adventure book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It started as marlow went down the congo river and he ran into people and met kurtz's and that is about all I cauoght on to.

He portrays the horror as if it was awakened or caused by the circumstances. If you wish to read a real book, please read &quot;Nausea&quot; by J.P. Sartre also available from Amazon."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book's \\"classic\\" label must have come from its rich, descriptive imagery that conveyed such vivid darkness and heaviness. It is purported to convey the shock of the awful experience the author himself had when he was in the Belgian Congo in 1890. Indeed, in reading it, I felt the heat, insects, violence, fear, and threat experienced by the narrator as he rode down a river deeper and deeper into the heart of Africa. Encounters with white brutality of the natives is not just moralizing about that specific situation, but hints at the human capacity for depravity that lurks in us all.The language seemed dated to me, however...somehow stiff or formal in the same way the the language in the Jules Verne books do. I found myself wanting to hurry it along. I was reminded that this story is the source of the oft quoted dying words of the character Mr. Kurtz, \\"The horror! The horror!\\"The sad story of the Congo's history is, in my opinion, better told elsewhere (e.g., BLOOD RIVER, LEOPOLD'S GHOST), but this small novella is an interesting and important part of the body of literature on this topic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I agree with the \\"2-star\\" reviewer: This reader's supercilious tone annoyed me from the start and though I'm the patient sort, Mr. Case's voice never enveloped me in this moody, brooding story. I imagined Marlow recounting his tale from the comfy confines of a deep leather chair at his favorite club rather than while seated cross-legged on the hard deck of an anchored \\"yawl\\" on a river in the middle of the night. What should have been spooky and ghost-story like came out almost shrill and abit grating to my ear. If you must listen to \\"Darkness\\" then this version will suffice but before buying I'd recommend checking out your public library first for a different edition."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I have read \\"Heart of Darkness\\" twice (once for myself and once for a class) and wrote a short English essay on the novel in high school. Joseph Conrad was a Polish born English author who created this symbolic adventure piece after seeing for himself the cruelty in Leopold's Congo. The novella has a worthwhile plot related in first person by the protagonist Marlow who tells listeners of his attempt to locate and return a brilliant, mysterious ivory trader named Mr. Kurtz deep in the Congo rainforrests. Along the way, Marlow has encounters with racist colonialists, slavery, and finally Kurtz with his ferocious natives. And to make things more interesting, Kurtz has completely lost his mind and is in failing health.\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is overall a fairly decent read. That said--and I may be about to offend the esteemed halls of Western Literature--I cannot bring myself to consider Conrad's book a truely great book. For one thing, English was not his first language and his writing style leaves something to be desired. Furthermore, the book is ultimately too short in my opinion to adequately cover its material. Conrad's characters are difficult to relate to and adequately sympathize with. To my great surprise in my AP English Literature Class, I found Wuthering Heights a superior work because of the characterization. Finally, I think the psychological depth of the novel is at times exaggerated. Yes, the novel has many symbolic elements and yes, very detailed psychological points can be derived from reading it. That said, many books could be extensively psychologically analyzed. Par Lagerkvist's final lines in \\"Barabbas\\" are in my opinion more chilling than Conrad's famous final words of Kurtz (I happen to think Richard Fleischer's and Christopher Fry's film version [Fry largely wrote the screen play] of \\"Barabbas\\" is superior to the book).In short, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is an interesting and for some readers will be a very enjoyable read. I personally do not find it an exceptional book. Others may disagree and that is fine. Everyone has their own tastes in literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Here is a book that combines the complete text of Conrad's novel with a biographical and historical introduction and five, excellent essays of contemporary criticism. The essays include a variety of approaches: psychoanalytical by Frederick Karl, reader-response by Adena Rosmarin, feminist by Johanna Smith, deconstruction by J. Hillis Miller, and new historicism by Brook Thomas. Each essay is preceeded by a description of the approach and followed by a concise bibliography of recommended sources that use the critical method. There is also an excellent glossary of critical and theoretical terms."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad is an amazing writer; he uses the English language of the late 19th and early 20th centuries beautifully, he describes the colonial world at its apogee, he tells engrossing stories but even his seemingly potboiler plots (such as The Secret Sharer) raise disturbingly serious moral issues. All of these qualities are epitomized in The Heart of Darkness. Can anyone read the Heart of Darkness without thinking of Apocalypse Now? I believe the movie is one of the best adaptations of literature to film but the impact of Conrad's story is as vivid as the movie."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"What are the crucial events that began the 20th century? Some would say the flight of the Wright Flyer at Kitty Hawk. Others point to Ford and the mass production of cars. Still others might point to the spread of AC electricity throughout US cities. I suggest this book's publication in 1902 as one of the crucial events that dawned the 20th century, as it was the first great strike against Western imperialism in Western literature, in a century that saw the fitful and violent decline of imperialism.In his youth, the author had spent time traveling the Belgian Congo on a steamer. His experiences there caused him to write this short novel, probably the shortest one of the great 20th century works. His story revolves around Charles Marlow, a character based on Conrad himself. Marlow sails into the Congo as an ivory trader and meets Kurtz, a man legendary for his cruelty wholly unbound by civilization and polite society. Throughout his trip, he encounters the human cruelty visited upon African locals by European overlords. This includes slavery, corporal punishment, over-taxation of locals, and outright genocide.All this is told by Marlow to a group of listeners upon a deck of a ship lying in the Thames River in London. Marlow himself sits in a Buddha-like pose, neither engaging his listeners visually or expressing emotion at his own horrific tale. This book is quite easy to read for most senior high school students and any university student as English is its original language, and being written around 1900, the vocabulary and style is quite similar to 21st century English. For those who are unfamiliar with colonialism in Africa, this is not a good introductory book. The book does not explore the roots (political, economic, historical) of white power in Africa, let alone the Congo. It is however a good accompaniment to a history lesson in African history. It is also a very visual book that provides stark images of human suffering and cruelty. It is, overall, a great work of English literature and critical expose of what imperialism and colonialism is."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Apocalypse Now doesn't do justice to this story. You need to actually lose yourself amidst the pages to discover the true darkness humanity possesses. With each page, you'll be drawn further and further into the jungle of emotions, where you'll try to keep away from the tentacles of nausea and disgust as you traverse the primordial struggle for survival. Sure, you'll fight the mosquitoes and humidity of ethics, but in the end you will succumb to what Joseph Conrad refers to as the dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths and germs of empires.-by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The heart of darkness contains numerous meanings as portrayed by this veriest yarn narrated by Marlow in his boat venture to see the inexplicable Kurtz.As written by the verbose and salty seaman Conrad, this book encounters personality eddies and characters ebbing into insanity as the narrator and others discover the Congo conjures an abject funk which today's jargon would describe as insanity.Deeply moving, this tale contrasts the horrible treatment of the Congo natives. Their value of life diminishes daily amid the pestiferous intrusion by Marlow and Kurtz and the Europeans' Belgian \\"Company\\" whose goal and bottom line is to gather all ivory - illegally if one must - for the good of the continental customers.The \\"heart of darkness\\" can be the merging of a gray sky to a gray ocean in the open sea as the sun sets; or it can be the heart of nature which permits the horror brought upon the natives by the whites; or it can be the end of the river which leads to Kurtz's camp of atrocities; or it can what lies in the unknown - the metaphor to the darkness we feared as children.Eerily, Conrad's writing leads you down the Congo River with the same trepidation and natural fear which a stranger in a very strange land would experience. The writing is so well done that it truly cannot be harnessed in other media. Orson Welles correctly determined this would not translate well into cinema. And, the great \\"Apocalypse Now\\" -- with its not-too-distant references -- touches the mood as well as celluloid can. But, it falls short.This is a qualified classic."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"We live in the flicker.\\" Need I say any more?

Be prepared to discover."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad was prolific and at moments as cryptic as Henry James, indeed, the two influenced one another.Perhaps, his enigmatic style is why his writings appeal to so many. We are forced to take part in his stories, filling in details from our own experiences, making the story unique from each individual's perspective.The heart of darkness is a comment on the darkness of man's soul symbolized by the descent into a foreboding thick jungle.The story is rich with alternating sequences of light/ dark and clarity/ambiguity creating a mood of mystery and uncertainty which never leaves you.The story has several narrators creating a bewildering effect perhaps to symbolize our own inner struggle with existence and it's meaning.We are introduced to Marlowe, one of the narrators, and indirectly told about Kurtz, a legendary ivory trader.As Marlowe enters the depths of the jungle in hopes of meeting Kurtz, Marlowe undergoes a psychological transformation as civilization is stripped around him. We see how man reverts to his true inner state when material possessions, titles and other superficialities are removed. This is highlighted when we finally meet Kurtz who turns out to be a hollow sickly figure physically and morally despite his accolades. This is contrasted with Marlowe, who possess some depth of character, and survives the ordeal albeit a changed man.Succinctly, the story presages a modern tenet of psychology which states that relocating physically does little to improve your mental state since the latter is taken with you. In fact, it may exacerbate the situation when all social norms are discarded unbridling your deepest darkest desires.Conrad also uses the story to comment on materialism and it's corrupting influence on one's soul replacing character development with material acquisition. This is symbolized by describing London as the land of the living dead.A fantastic compact psychological thriller we all can relate to."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is one of the few novels that incorporates a psychological view upon society and the issues that divided and exploited cultures. Joseph Conrad creates Marlow, the protagonist, as a man who is dumbfounded by the corruption and exploitation taking palce in the Congo. The novel is full of description in relation to the scenery, but it helps the reader form conclusions of the overall theme. Conrad shows the things man is capable of for money, including death.Marlow is faced with the decision of being kind to the \\"criminals\\" or pursuing the original motive of his arrival to the Congo, money.Heart of Darkness makes the reader aware of the issues that penetrate society and cause rivalry between certain groups. This is a short, yet inciting novel that has a strong universal theme."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's language is impeccable. He writes in a crisp, precise and succinct manner. And this novella is perhaps one of his grandest works. It served as the backbone of the plot of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" This epic Oliver Stone movie about Viet Nam was fully adapted from Conrad's tale.The book is highly autobiographical. Conrad was a river boat captain in the Congo during the time that the area was being highly exploited for its Ivory. He observed cruelties and horrors that were not fully comprehendible by modern man. He endured sickness and hardship; which ultimately destroyed his health to the point that he had to give up his river runs in the Congo. But his memories and his hatred of what he saw was intact.In Heart of Darkness Conrad describes a man who has looked deeply into his soul. This deep introspection and understanding into the deepest depths of human depravity had been seen by Mr. Kurtz. He had looked at them with eyes wide open and integrated the most horrible of humanity into his experience. The book drips with references to death. Yet the references are not superfluous.The book shows the horror of the exploitation of the Europeans. They did all and more than the Americans did in the era of slavery. The cruelest of cruelty. The most abominable conditions. The death and destruction. All of it was present in the Congo as well. And Conrad saw it, up close and personal.The book is truly a classic. It is nice to have a hard cover edition around. It is recommended to all serious readers of English and American literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Bear with me a moment.Any short story of merit deserves to be read repeatedly, as it is likely that a new appreciation for the work will emerge with each immersion. Such it is with stories like Young Goodman Brown, and The Dead. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is a longer work than these two, but it is considered short. In the book I read it in, it was barely one hundred pages long.My first reading of Heart of Darkness was rather laborious, likely because I have been readying children's and young adult fantasy for the past year, for unrelated research purposess. Imagine the shock! When I finished reading it, my head was spinning a bit. Without doubt, I recognized that I had finished reading a truly great story, but I was not entirely sure why it was great, so far gone was my brain in it's genre fixation. Therefore, I read it again.It was my second reading of Heart of Darkness that offered the intense enjoyment of *understanding* the greatness of a thing. It wasn't merely a story of a voyage into the Congo; nay, it was a story of man's inhumanity toward other men, and raised disturbing questions about imperialism (which now, more than 100 years later, we recognize more vividly).Then there was the simple symbolism. There are two women knitting black wool that seem to hint at the Fates of Greek mythology. What are they knitting? It is most likely the doom of the Africans, while these \\"fates\\" have an uneasy alliance with their gods, The Company.There is the the use of white and black, so prevalent in the story. Juxtaposed against each other, they showed the ridiculousness of man's perception of black being bad and white being good - for there was nothing good about the Company - as it is a company entirely of Whites. Even the Accountant is immaculately dressed and described as draped in white.These examples scratch the surface.It was such a delight to read something again that made me *think*. And I'm eagerly awaiting the third reading, although I want to read a few more stories by Conrad before I do so again.One reviewer said that friends of his derided him for reading books read in high school. I remember reading The Scarlet Letter, As I Lay Dying, Slaughterhouse Five, The Great Gatsby (and others that aren't coming directly to mind). Are these books not classics of literature because they were read in high school? Rubbish and sophistry."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's novel, essentially, is not about colonialism. Colonialism just brings his subject into sharp relief.As Marlow travels into the heart of the continent, he also travels into the heart of man. On the lower, outer river, the man, Kurtz, is perceived as successful, idealistic - he's going to put an end to the exploitative aspect of colonialism. But the deeper Marlowe takes us, the less idealistic Kurtz becomes until, at last, we find Kurtz, the real Kurtz. He murders, steals, enslaves, tortures - and loves it. Taken from this horrific life, he's found crawling on his hands and knees back to it. He himself sees what he truly is, thus his dying words.Conrad's novel deals with total depravity - that true nature that mankind glosses over with civility and manners. Conrads message is: dress it how you will - it is still depravity."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book contains two short novels: The Secret Sharer and Conrad's classic Heart of Darkness, both with similar settings and ideas.The Secret Sharer is more of a short story than a novel, and in it Conrad explores the idea of a double. Like the captain, we all have someone that we relate to - in effect a darker side of ourself that we do not often acknowledge.Heart of Darkness was written nearly ten years earlier, but the same themes are evident in this work also. Kurtz is one of the deepest, most realistic characters in all of literature. His savagery is repulsive, yet the reader grows to admire this man who kills to sastify his primordial urges, his &quot;heart of darkness.&quot;It is really wonderful that these two novellas have been compiled in one volume. Once you have read them both, the reader comes to a better understanding that, like the narrator(s), he/she is also capable of unspeakable actions, but they may not know of thier own destructiveness until the very end.A cautionary word: These are both excellent reads, but they are far from cozy ones. Conrad makes use extensively of a rich vocabulary and the books are filled with long, descriptive paragraphs. The reader should be mature enough to understand the writer's style as well as the characters and themes. But if you're looking for some short books to leave you thinking, this selection is an excellent choice. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book requires all of your attention, and the entire time you read it, you may wonder why you are bothering to keep the book open. The first time I read it, I thought it was a decent story about the jungle, until about a day later as I slowly began to realize that this was one of the best books I had ever read. It is perfectly titled. The Heart of Darkness. The story of how an exemplary member of civilized society--an intelligent, educated, and emotionally stable human--can fall to the animalistic brutality that we \\"civilized\\" people prefer to relegate to the Third World or to antiquity. This book is earthshaking just because it forces the realization that our own 'humanity' rests on the fragile trappings of society. One only need read the headlines of the latest events in the Middle East or in the setting of the story, Africa, to understand that the Heart of Darkness is as relevant today as ever. Conrad's perfect prose in his second language and his quiet, observant, and always understating demeanor are bonuses to readers of this timeless work."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read this in high school and again 30 years later. If you read it your younger days and have been through a couple of decades of life since, I'd recommend you read it again. It is one of those books with narrative powerful enough for the young and insight enough for the middle-aged. I'll read it again in 20 years or so and let you know if it still stands up, but I suspect it will."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"What can I say that already hasn't been said. This is a brilliant work of art with layers upon layers of symbols to rummage through. Conrad writes this with a deft touch, making every word count and letting the reader feel every word he writes. This is a book to learn about life from, as we all plod along to a certain goal, the obstacles in the way, etc. I too had to read this in high school but wasn't as impressed. I then read it three times in college and once I fully understood what Conrad was saying it all became clear and I reveled in it.Anyone who says they &quot;don't get this book&quot; or it's &quot;too boring to follow&quot; try watching the movie &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; which is based on this book, and it'll help you to better understand it.Reviews for this book have one the the largest ranges I've seen. It isn't light fare like Jane Austen or the Brontes, so that turns some people off. I however think this is the single greatest literary achievement in the english language, coming fron an author to whom English was a second language."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Terrible disappointment. The first paragraph of every page is missing - so the book cannot be read.Will try again with a hard copy."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The HEART OF DARKNESS is a frame story. The outside frame consists of four men sailing on the Thames on a boat called the \\"Nellie.\\"The narrator of this part of the story, one of the four men, turns the story over to one of the other men, Marlow, who speaks for most of this short novel. He describes how he was hired by a company trading in ivory to retrieve one of their agents from the heart of the Congo--a man named Kurtz.Before Marlow describes his adventure, the Thames is identified as the river used by the Romans when they came to subjugate and exploit the barbaric tribes living in what would eventually be called England. This brilliant irony is meant to parallel the contemporary Europeans and their exploitation of the blacks in the Congo to the Romans and the ancient English.Marlow's spoken account describes a descent into darkness. The superior technology of the European company (guns, steamboat, and machines) is used to exploit the ivory trade and subjugate the natives--who are variously referred to as savages, cannibals, devils, and the \\"N\\" word. I couldn't disagree more with those who claim that this novella is racist. It is a depiction of racism--much like HUCKLEBERRY FINN--at the end of the 19th century in Europe.When Marlow eventually finds Kurtz, after a harrowing steamboat trip down the Congo, he is horrified. The man has made himself into a god for the natives, has killed and beheaded enemy tribesmen, and essentially become more savage than the savages. The interior of the Congo is literally the heart of darkness (the impenetrable, foreboding jungle), Kurtz has a heart of darkness, and the allusion to the Romans at the outset suggests that all humanity possesses this defect, which shows up in generation after generation. I found the novel to be an inspired indictment of European colonialism and an extended metaphor for human evil.I downloaded this for free to my Kindle and read it in two days."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The effects of empire are illustrated well in this novel. Conrad lets us know what happens when a nation becomes caught up in imperial process and seeks dominion over other cultures.Kurtz is an interesting character in that we don't even meet him in the work until the end, yet he is still without doubt the main character. The draw of empire is explicitly undermined, and for that reason, I feel people turned away from HoD when it first came out.Yet the heart of darkness is not something that I see as a slander to Africa or that continent's people. It is the abject understanding that what the people in the home country think is being done in their name is much different that what is actually happening. That the imperial necessity of efficiency and productivity necessarily means that one culture is set against another. That one culture, which prides itself on civilization is forced to do seriously uncivilized things. That when people in middle management are allowed absolute power, disaster comes to the fore.It is in this light that Kurtz can be seen as a sympathetic character. He is a sociological study in what happens when someone with little or no training becomes the lord and master of an entire group of people. This point I think is lost by those who attack the novel as a racist trope. I don't think Conrad is pro-empire in this novel, he is just showing where this type of thing leads: Subjugation, depravity and mass death, and a cynicism about human worth and life that is horrifying.I highly recommend this novella. I hope all who read it will keep in mind those aspects which apply to us as Americans as they did 110 years ago to the British."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Can one sufficiently praise this book without sounding false? Conrad is a masterful writer and a genius for finding the exact word (a point of criticism for those who say this makes him read like he's been translated from another language, but a point to savour for the lover of language). His precise word choice does not make this book or its ideas any less ambiguous or shallow, however. This one will get deep into the flesh of your mind and simmer there as you try to find a concrete understanding of the ideas suggested. A must read for anyone literate."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Heart of Darkness was certainly not what I had expected - for such a slender book, it was mighty deep. On the surface, it is the tale of an Englishman venturing into the \\"depths\\" of the Congo, the separation of \\"civilized\\" European lifestyle growing as the principal character travels deeper and deeper into \\"primitive\\" Africa.The cultural comparisons and ethical and moral issues the book raises are why the book is regarded as a classic - no answers are given, rather the reader is invited to determine who is the more civilized - the greedy and pugnatious colonists, or the half-clad Africans.The imagery vivid, although I found the writing itself to be a bit hard to follow - the monologue of the narrator and principal character, Marlowe can be a bit difficult to follow - hence the 4 stars. A worthwhile read if only to wrestle with the issue of civility and morality."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The final vision of Heart of Darkness is one of intoxicating, perhaps inevitable, destruction. Destruction that comes from too much truth. As Marlow returns to \\"civilization\\", he finds it shallow, fake, all its goodness based on a lie. Yet the truth is deadly-- the lie is necessary to survive-- and so the choice is difficult. Live the shallow lie and be happy, or face the intoxicating truth and risk destruction?This is the way I felt as I read this book. It is dark and intoxicating -- certainly not happy or \\"fun\\" to read. The narrative sweeps you along toward the Heart of Darkness as steadily, quietly, and unswervingly and the river carries Marlow there. You wonder if you should get out. You wonder if you even can. You are half-afraid about where it is taking you, but fascination far outweighs the fear. And when it's over, you're simply glad you've survived... and certain, completely certain, that it's changed you somehow, even if you don't exactly know how...Read it. It's an amazing book. You may not like it, but you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"What is the morality of man and the justice he dispenses if his will is free to reign upon his environment untouched?This seems to be the central theme around which the novel presents itself. With nothing to fear, cherish, and little obligation in surroundings of sheer montruous, palpable silence, what thoughts, actions, and driving forces does wo(man) succept himself towards?In the case of Kurtz, an ivory trader with little accountability for the ruthless business practices that tortured those whose environment it was taken from and eventually the minds of the people who were overtaken by greedy, despotic forces, it leads to a rise to chief, god-like, sacred status. Meanwhile to investigate the lack of correspondence from Kurtz, a young adventurer Marlow is set out on a voyage not only to the heart of the depths of the jungle, but into the depths of the vaguaries of man's intention. Along the way he is transformed and enlightened and this leads him to an alienating feeling.What could leads to such transfigurations of one's outlook on life? Why only the subtle, sublime, morphing, incongruent, transcendental, enrapturing prose of the Great Joseph Conrad!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Throughout Heart of Darkness Marlow is terribly confused. The virtues and morality-the restraint-that he thought to be characteristic of man and integral for his survival are actually only exigencies. Though he maintains a calm and commanding presence, inside he nearly shatters from this revelation. And constantly he hears the drums that beat in time to his heart-he feels the wildness of the jungle tugging at him, coercing so gently that one might not notice until after the darkness had already taken his soul.Even in the beginning of the novel, Marlow's eyes were closed to the reality of the Company. When his aunt naively praises the company for its \\"charitable ambitions\\", he gently corrects her, informing her that it is in fact a company fun for profit. As the novel progresses, Marlow is given more than enough reason to despise the Company. The man-of-war shelling bullets into an empty beach reeked of insanity. Even nature seemed tinged with death and oppressive despair.Marlow encounters the chief accountant wearing his spotless white clothing and is sickened. This sycophant and hypocrite appears to Marlow twice as corrupt and uncivilized as the natives do. Marlow despises the manager whom he meets later on as well for being hollow and false.On his journey to Kurtz's Inner Station Marlow is bombarded with news of Kurtz. All view Kurtz with a sort of fearful respect-it is as if they are speaking of some omniscient boogieman that will appear if you say its name aloud. Even when criticizing him they speak in low voices tinged with dread.Marlow has begun to abhor the Company. As he hears its agents speak bitingly of this man, he comes to a resolution. He is going to be on whatever side is against the Company. Proving that he has already allowed the darkness to seep into his blood somewhat, he tells his first lie to the Manager. Even though Kurtz is only a void to Marlow Kurtz is already influencing him.Marlow's abandonment of society's values is further evidenced in his relation to the cannibals. \\"Fine fellows-cannibals-in their place. There were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them\\". Seen from the view of society this is a bizarre comment, one Marlow would not have thought if he were still in his native city. Marlow realizes that the natives of the jungle have not let the darkness overtake them as the Company agents have-that just because one lives in the jungle is not a justification to lack restraint. Moreover, Marlow is even more confused as \\"civilized society\\" and \\"chaotic but not entirely dark jungle\\" war with one another. He is trying to choose his nightmare.This internal conflict is consummated when Marlow encounters Kurtz alone in the forest. Here Marlow feels the darkness stronger than ever before-the drums beat on insanely. \\"I thought I would never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age...\\"Here is Marlow's choice of nightmares-here is the point where he is forced to choose. To Kurtz crouched on all fours, he says, \\"You will be lost, utterly lost\\", perhaps speaking to himself as well. Therefore, Marlow's sanity (as sanity is generally perceived) is speaking to him, and Marlow has chosen to return to civilization after all, though from hereafter he will have a sharper clarity of the ambiguity of goodness.Marlow's internal struggle is what the entire book illumines. Through Marlow's \\"choice of nightmares\\", we are made aware of our own choices."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"What a piece of work is this book!A friend of mine told me he doesn't like Conrad's prose because he finds it too wordy, as if it were not his own. Yes, English was a lent language to him, but who cares.The whole book is nothing but a yarn, an outburst of words that comes from the entrails of a man who has seen too much. It is the tale told by the idiot.... that one &quot;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&quot;. Yet Marlow is not an idiot and what he tells garners its meaning as the story develops before his own eyes and those of his occasional listeners. His voice is also a lent one, the voice that comes from primeval experiences, from primeval horror.He realizes that the long trip in which he had engaged (that search of ivory in the depths of the unknown and desired Africa), is a trip to the horror of human behavior."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read this book in anticipation of seeing the new screen version of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" after hearing that this novella served as the moral foundation for the movie. The story documents the philosophy that in order for a good man to conquer or overcome evil, he himself must become evil. This book ties in so very well with the moral and philosophical positions and issues the US Government has to address and take into consideration (...). Conrad is a phenomally gifted author whose stories serve to consider and address the various moral and philosophical issues man is so often confronted with. Heart of Darkness is a powerful and well-written observation on the battle of good versus evil within man's conscience."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"&quot;Not a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago, luminous with another than a professional light.&quot;"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read this book 20 years ago in college, back then I didn't understand it. Now I re-read it again and it meant so much now. To me the best part of the book is the last 30 pages of this edition.

Those last 30 pages, I re-read it many times."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Every time I read this I am always amazed at how much has been accomplished in so short a span of pages. And the effect of this work does not diminish with repeat readings. So if you have already read this and most people have read it again. I gaurantee you won't regret it. This is probably the most perfectly executed work of Conrads career and that is saying a lot. Very few authors wrote a greater number of works that remain classics and relevant than he. The primitive world has a voice in this book as do colonial administrators and we even get to hear from that one who has gone off the edge of the map of humanity and into his own realm of darkness but the voice dominating this book is Marlowes'. He tells the tale aboard a ship in safe harbor in the London docks but his voice takes you on quite a journey. From the very first scene described in the administration offices with strange black clad women figures sewing we know this is going to be like no tale we have heard before. The work as a whole is so perfect it makes one think of music as the only comparison. Still no other tale like it exists. If you haven't picked this one up in a while do so and listen to Marlowe tell it once again. Listen to the music and feel the power of the primitive pulse through you as you journey toward the heart of an immense darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read this because it was the inspiration for the movie Apocalypse Now which is one of my all time favorite movies, IT is amazing, deep, thought provoking and probably a more honest Vietnam movie, up to a point...The book however I found tedious. I didn't really &#34;enjoy&#34; it, I didn't hate it, but I was determined to finish it because that is just how I am. There were enough brief glimpses of where the movie came from even though the time, setting and virtually everything was different.

If you have not read this book in a decade, read it again and you will probably come away with a very different feeling (or maybe it is just that I have experienced combat since reading it last).Finally, being a Buddhist I really felt that the \\"circle\\" of life was explained in Kurtz final words, \\"the horror\\", but part of me was pulling for his redemption and longed for part of the story of what Kurtz would have become if he had left the river.One last thing that may haunt the reader is the spooky thought that there may be a Kurtz inside each of us. If you will not accept this fact I think you have not truly inspected your own posibilities.....and how different situations will drastically change what you will allow of yourself."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The fourth Norton Critical Edition of Heart of Darkness brings the controversies up to date with the new millennium. By shifting the weight off the dated and unpopular textual criticism which once dominated Norton Critical Editions (now in an unobtrusive appendix), this version makes the book relevant to the current critical environment. This version emphasizes the historicity and sociopolitical implications that students and general readers often prefer.Besides critical stalwarts like Chinua Achebe and Patrick Brantlinger, editor Paul B. Armstrong, succeeding Robert Kimbrough, brings in timely voices like Adam Hochschild and Edward Said. He also makes this edition intertextual by weaving in criticism on the book's relationship to Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" Since young audiences may know that movie better than this book, that makes for an interesting and germane supplement to this edition.Not only does Armstrong guide us through the concerns of the late 19th century, when this book was written, but he also demonstrates how this book remains vital to our lives today. The racial, economic, and national concerns which were Conrad's bread and butter still take place today. And we read this book, Armstrong shows us, not because it's old and well-written, but because it speaks directly to the world of the early 21st century.Heart of Darkness has so much going on, but is often sold to be read like a paperback novel. Too many people think it's a dull academic exercise written to torment students. Thus I recommend this edition. Not only do you get an action-packed and dreamlike story, you also get a guide to lead you through the many implications of the novel. This compact, affordable edition makes this novel as timely as journalism written today, and far more exciting."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is Joseph Conrad's most famous and arguably best work - not only one of the greatest short works ever but simply one of the greatest period. At once vividly realistic and profoundly symbolic, it on the one hand did much to expose the Belgian Congo's atrocities and on the other is a brilliant allegory whose precise meaning is still hotly debated over a century later. One would be very hard-pressed to find a text of such length with so many and various interpretations - nay, a text of any length; Shakespeare and a few other mainstays aside, hardly any other English language text has proven so malleable. It has been seen through lenses ranging from historical to psychoanalytic to seemingly everything between them - not least including biographical, as the scariest thing about the story is just how closely it is based on Conrad's experience. \\"Heart\\" is in many ways the culmination of early Conrad, which featured, among other focuses, a strong sea element and an emphasis on European colonialism in Africa and elsewhere. It fuses both into a dark masterpiece that works on many levels. Most simply and obviously, it can be appreciated as a sort of adventure story involving exploration and human endurance pushed to its limit; it has some fine suspense in this sense. Far more importantly, it is an unflinching look into the darkness of humanity's heart - a dramatization of just how low human nature can sink. This is most overt in the depiction of brutal inhumanity toward fellow human beings, but multiple symbolic layers make it all the more disturbing. Conrad shows that, for all civilization's supposed progress, the bestial instincts underlying humanity are only repressed - and quite weakly at that. It takes only an ostensibly primitive setting to bring them out, and when unleashed they can be at least as vicious as any wild animal's and worse in being malicious. The speaker Marlow's own harsh experience suggests all this, but it comes across most forcefully in the legendary character Kurtz. Like many ambitious but unethical Europeans of the era, Kurtz had no problem exploiting those in the Congo for personal gain, but the shocking conditions and enforced brutality eventually wear him down to the point where he snaps. It is debatable whether his days end in madness or some extreme guilt/shock combination, but his immortal final words - \\"The horror! The horror!\\" - sum up the whole story and all it symbolizes. The realization of just how bad things are hits Marlow so hard that he cannot bring himself to tell Kurtz's widow the truth, letting her think that his last words were her name, though he was so far gone that he had no time to even think of such things. As his final comment says, \\"It would have been too dark--too dark altogether...\\" Much the same may be said of the story itself, so realistically unflattering is its humanity depiction, which is a large part of the reason it is a masterwork. There are many others, not least Conrad's hauntingly beautiful and complex prose. Much of his reputation as a stylist comes from this, and it is simply incredible that he was not a native English speaker.These factors among many others made \\"Heart\\" a standard of English curricula for decades, and its popularity shows no sign of lessening. However, it has been the focus of attention for another reason in the last few decades - racist accusations stemming from African writer Chinua Achebe's famous essay. Conrad was certainly prejudiced and ethnocentric, if not necessarily racist in today's sense, which is reflected in \\"Heart\\" and most of his other work. That said, for what it is worth, he was no more so than the average writer - much less the average person - of his day. Indeed, his experience as a Polish, initially non-English speaking outsider on ships around the world and in England gave him more empathy for those outside mainstream Western culture than nearly anyone else in it could have had. One can even argue that it is perverse to pick on \\"Heart\\" when racist overtones can be found in nearly every work from the Victorian era - nay, nearly everything right up until the last few decades - since it shows some empathy for Africans, is generally seen as anti-colonialist, and eventually helped lead to reform. Many also say that such a stance misses the story's larger point, racist or not. Yet there is much to Achebe's reading, and all serious fans should read it and make their own decision. Many editions include it, but all should seek it out.\\"Heart\\" is one of the most anthologized works in English, available in many collections of both Conrad and general literature. It is possible to get it alone or with almost any number of other works by Conrad and others along with widely varying amounts of supplemental material. Cost of course varies along with this. Readers must decide what fits their needs, but anyone wanting an inexpensive \\"Heart\\" need look no further than this."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Sunset unfolds along the Thames River, bestowing the day's final gilded caresses upon the bow of an old ship, and the men who sit waiting for the tide. The luminescent skyline and haze-drenched shores incite the tired memory of one sailor, soon drawing out a bizarre tale set in the heart of the Congo. A story of racism, greed, human depravity, vain ambition, and the choices one makes on their own in the darkest regions of the soul. This, in essence, is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.Told through Marlow, an old, British seaman reflecting back upon his earlier years as a steamboat Captain in a time when the ivory boon was high, and the opinion of African natives unpardonable, Conrad's novella is barely 95 pages long, and yet a verbose read. Our protagonist describes his venture for a trade shipping company as he travels up a river \\"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country,\\" to collect both ivory and a fellow by the name of Kurtz.Kurtz's enigmatic reputation precedes him (for the copious amounts of ivory he yields and the god-like influence he possesses over others, as well as his assured position of title within the company), and Marlow finds himself enrapt, nay--becoming obsessed, with the image of this man. As the swampy, protracted journey continues, Marlow's absorption expands until, at last, in the afterward of a bloody raid on his ship from local natives, he meets Kurtz face-to-face. Or what is left of Kurtz.What Marlow discovers in Kurtz is more a ghostly fiend than a man. An individual who, though at one time was very similar to Marlow, has allowed his ambitious ideals and time away from \\"civilized society\\" to alter him into a debauched monster. A god among the local natives, he wields his position with fear and cruelty. In their few grim days together, Marlow comes to both loath and pity Kurtz--revolted by the man's uncouth methods, yet identifying with the desires which have led him to use them.It is Kurtz's famous (and pathetic) cry of, \\"The horror! The horror!\\" which sums up the palpable flavor of the book. One wonders if his horror is due to the inability to fulfill his ambitions, or the realization that those ambitions have betrayed him. And what of Marlow's response? Might his own ideology betray him as well?Joseph Conrad does us the gut-wrenching service of challenging the conscience through graphic visuals and an inquiry into Marlow and Kurtz's personal ethics. Considered semi-autobiographical, Conrad's Heart of Darkness takes us readers on a journey into the jungles of our own souls, there to breed reflection and discomfort with the hope that we will somehow find our way back out--alive and perhaps even altered for the better."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It is well written. The idea of a storyteller in the story is not unique but very effective. We could ponder over the word darkness for quite some time. The best way to ponder is with Cliff's Notes. Personally I wanted him to get on with it. I guess I was a little impatient for the action and the conclusion. If it hadn't been for cliff notes I would have missed haft the things he was implying.A merchant company is missing an agent Kurtz, and Marlowe must find him. Traveling though harsher environments than he imagined possible he may have found what he was seeking. As with many of this type of epic the physical distance or direction is not as important then the transformation it plays on ones soul.I missed this book somehow in school. The reason I started to read this book before actually I actually became immersed in it, was to see how close it came to the movie. No not the movie you are thinking of. \\"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\\" (1988). The film was shot primarily in the avocado groves maintained by the University of California at Riverside (UCR), which the university uses for horticultural experiments. Adrienne Barbeau is Dr. Kurtz.The horror.....the horror.....Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is of course a great classic of Western literature and needs no summary or critique from me.Nevertheless I could make some suggestions to readers coming to this work for the first time. It has many complexities and more than any other novel of Conrad's needs support by background material and literary guides. For one thing it is a narration within a narration, and for another it has several complex characters. I would recommend starting with the Spark notes available online. Use before or as you read.Some familiarity with the historical setting and geography are helpful also before you start. (Other reviewers have mentioned this.) Heart of Darkness is very rooted in the ugliness and rawness of African colonialism and in particular the exploitation of the Congo. The fact that this area is still a scene of horrors adds poignancy to Conrad's novel. The geography is relevant too. Heart of Darkness involves essentially two rivers--the Congo and the Thames. The Congo is second only to the Amazon in terms of water flow volume. Tracing the course of the Congo from the ocean to the heart of the interior of Africa on Google maps is an enlightening exercise. Use the satellite function zoomed in--you'll be amazed at how vast, empty, and vertiginous, and long the river is.Surely in the 1890s the journey up the Congo that Marlow made in a resurrected old paddle wheel steamboat must have been one of the most tedious, wearying, depressing, and difficult journeys one could make. It probably still is.Heart of Darkness, however, is not just a story of a journey up a river into darkest Africa. It is also a story of a journey into the darkness of the heart."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"My daughter read this for her senior year language arts class and, of course, there's all sorts of symbolism and stuff in it.

He decides on changing careers and going into the business of a privateer and entering into the unmarked areas of Africa in order to find a mysterious man who is both a beast and an inspiration in the lives of everyone he meets.This book is incredibly short, and has just recently become public domain. The length of the text is its most amazing and inspiring components as it is written almost poetically to the point of having just the perfect words in the perfect places to outline the absolute recesses of human darkness and depravity. Stunningly short, stunningly perfect in many ways, Heart of Darkness is a simple approach to such a complicated topic. It is completed so perfectly and succinctly that it is easily defended as one of the greatest works in the English Language. I have no problem with that categorization.That said, I am intrigued as a writer and a reader in often trying to find faults within some of the works that fall in to the great English Canon, and I think it is relatively easy to find my faults within this. While the frame story does happen to add to the meaning of the text, our story really doesn't matter until we get to our narrator's story about halfway through the text. But there is a reason the first half exists. I just always wonder with the frame within a frame happening when we hear about Kurtz's right hand man offering reports of him 3/4 of the way through the book, and then the word of mouth transference is given all the more confusion by Marlow's words then being spoken to our narrator, I wonder if there really was need for our narrator at all. I also constantly wonder if there was a better way to showcase the wonder of the undiscovered world by removing him and producing it in some other way - either putting him on the boat with Marlow as an assistant or anything else. My thoughts on this come from the end - the same concentration on our narrator is not given at the end, and the narrative really just drops off with Marlow. What I mean, I suppose, is that our narrator is important Thematically, but not Structurally, and this is the ultimate problem I have with the text.The writing is absolutely beautiful, though. In the second half of the book, it is completely gorgeous prose, written perfectly and succinctly. Furthermore, the sense of wonder a first reader should have in reading it is really important to the meaning of the book. We live in a world where information travels quickly, and there is really nothing that remains a surprise or a mystery. In Heart of Darkness we are transported to a world without Google Maps and GPS to a land of fear and wonder. This adventure story is unlike any other in this aspect; that we are just as afraid as Marlow is in the fog, surrounded by bloodcurdling screams, as poisoned arrows silently emerge into our boat and our comrades.In this book, the horror is almost just as beautiful.Finally, what is interesting is that when I read this on my last excursion on Marlow's boat, I coincidentally read a graphic novel called \\"Stuffed!\\" that is also about modern race relations and postcolonialism in today's complicated times, and it made me really impressed and nostalgic for this work where many of the amazing final paragraphs can resonate as brilliant writing when contrasted with other pieces dealing with the same themes. Conrad's work is simply unparalleled."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"i did not understand this book until my college teacher explained it i was reviewing it for my childs ap class."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Absent from this story within a story is a sparkling dialogue of facinating characters, but what there is is an incredible and often failed attempt of Conrad to get his beefy literary arms wrapped around the multiple permutations of evil. This novel is so dark, so much on the &#34;cutting edge&#34; of the darkness that hunts each human soul that it is tantalizing and more than a little frightening. This is definitely a book for mature and well grounded minds."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is an amazing book. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates great literature. It is a must read with great themes."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I usually don't read fiction. I find that history is by itself exciting enough. However, whatever I read of central Africa always seemed to allude to \\"Heart of Darkness\\", so I decided to give it a try.Mind you, when I was a boy Africa was still a hodge-podge of European colonies. Now, the word \\"empire\\" has undergone a gigantic change as people refer to America, for example, as an imperialistic nation. After all, Americans acquired the Philippines from Spain (an imperialistic nation in the old sense), promised to create a country capable of self-government and to grant independence in 1946, drove out the Japanese (a truly imperialistic nation) in 1945, and then granted independence in 1946 - as promised.Tossing around the term \\"imperialist\\" as is done today diminishes the impact of what imperialism actually, in most cases, was. In its original sense, an imperialistic nation was one that conquered another people and then bled them of wealth with the sole rationale of enriching the home country. Central Africa in the late Nineteenth Century represented the worse form of imperialism.The Congo was established as a private corporation under King Leopold of Belgium, later becoming a colony of Belgium. The most horrible and depressing of human transgressions were committed in the name of humanity and human enrichment. Joseph Conrad traveled in the Congo during the worst of its atrocities - atrocities on par with any you have ever imagined.\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is drawn from his experiences. The events and characters are amalgams of those he met or heard about. The book is itself \\"dark\\" and depressing. It is an exploration of the shadows of human nature. You will not be uplifted by it; you will be forced to think.I read \\"Heart of Darkness\\" with a fairly extensive knowledge of the time. This made it all the more interesting to me. I suspect that it would lose something if read in a vacuum. I recommend this book, but only after reading some other books on Africa during the Nineteenth Century."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is well worth the read. It was the inspiration for some modern films including Apocalypse Now. Frightening and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Writing that reminds you of your humanity, and streams you onward like a wave. The world Conrad creates seems like a haunted graveyard of our own."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is one of those books that I've heard about all my life, but never got around to reading. This is not because I don't like to read, but because I read too much -- for research and pleasure -- and don't have time or strength of eye to read what I WANT to read, just because I want to. So I listened to the book-on-CD version of Conrad's classic, and was glad I did.One thing about the book is, skip all the commentary and just read or listen to the book. If you have extra time, go back and read it again. (I'll want to mark key passages eventually on a paper version.) Conrad is a great writer; his writings do not need to be \\"explained.\\"It's not only a good story -- and it is that -- Heart of Darkness is also (transparently, who needs commentary?) a critique both of colonialism and of human nature in general. The narrator's preference for the raw barbarity of his anti-hero over the veneer of civility in the Beligian company for which he works, is telling.It is also, perhaps, significant that the scene of this descent into moral madness is Belgian Congo. Go back to day, and how much has changed? It's still one of the nastiest places on earth.As a former missionary, I do happen to think there are better models of cultural transmission than either of the alternatives Conrad describes. I believe redemption is possible, not only in theory, but in historical fact. But I appreciate his description of the journey upriver -- which in many ways is a journey into the raw human heart. He reminds me of Orwell, another atheist who faced the cruelty of human nature with great honesty. Redemption doesn't need to end with the Heart of Darkness, but it does begin by honestly facing these truths."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Unspeakably beautiful prose. The images reinforcing the narrative reinforcing the resulting horror, always slightly offstage, but always so close to your own soul as if to feel its very breath.The plot consists of a frame story and narration of an \\"adventure\\" or a misadventure, where a young ambitious man takes a job as a river pilot, sent to investment operations in Africa, with a mission to go upriver and obtain goods and ivory. The story follows his journey from introduction to his employer, his travels in Africa, and his return.But the plot is not the story, for it is the internal narration that we encounter his growing knowledge and apprehension and anxiety but compelling necessity of meeting Kurtz, the manager of the inner station of the operation.But even the voice is not the story, for it is the care in which the words are chosen, and the ineffable quality of their lulling you into a state of consciousness of evil. After reading the book you are left marvelling at how literature is capable of such power."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The story is that of a group of men aboard the Nellie, among them the anonymous narrator, who are told Marlow's experience in the Congo in the 1890s. Marlow's career, like Conrad's, spans an important period in the history of relations between Europe and Africa. The author's purpose is to show that the \\"civilising\\" mission actually reveals the \\"darkness\\" at its own heart instead of bringing light into the darkness as it claims.In 1890 Conrad was appointed to the Congo by the Societe Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce and in June that year he reached Kinshasa, the Central Station in \\"Heart of Darkness\\". But soon the idealised realities of a boy's dreams were replaced by \\"the distasteful knowledge of the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience and geographical exploration\\" (in \\"Last Essays\\").Thus Marlow's journey to the Congo becomes a moral journey in which he confronts the workings of colonialism and his account is a frame-tale with inset stories, a so-called \\"oblique narration\\" - a tale within another tale. The darkness of Marlow's expedition is enhanced by the fact that his quest for Kurz contains repeated references to the latter's \\"eloquence\\" and \\"gift of expression\\" thus promising to articulate the solution to the moral and philosophical problems that the journey has created. Marlow's encounter with Kurz is a bitter disappointment with its \\"desolate exclamations, shrugs, hints ending in sighs\\".Although Conrad shows the criminality of inefficiency and selfishness of Europeans when dealing with the civilising work of Africa, the narrative is not gloomy. Kurz himself is merely a victim of the discourse of imperialism and his break-up shows how damaging it is for both Africans and Europeans.Another aspect in Conrad's novel is the stereotypical representation of women and the exclusion of the female reader. This is shown in Kurz's last words before dying: \\"The horror! The horror!\\" which refer to his Intended!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Heart of the Darkness begins on the ship named Nellie, as it steadily flows down the Thames River. The main characters that are introduced in the beggining are the Director of Companies, who is a captain, a lawyer, an accountant, and Marlow, who is the main leader of the whole group. Marlow narrates about his trip to Congo, Africa. He began his life story by introducing his early childhood and how he had always wanted to be a sailor and explorer. One of the most important trips was the one to Congo River, which fascinated him with many of its secrets. When he had finally arrived to Congo with his trade caravan, he had met Mr. Kurtz, who was there as a slave trader and was mad with power. Later he figured out that Mr. Kurtz was an ivory dealer and has bases set up full of ivory. Marlow had his eye set on exploring the general mentality of people in that area and seeing how Mr. Kurtz's business is going. He was soon dissapointed in his work, due to the racial exploitations, and had set sailed back on his way home."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"For me, this was not a very interesting story. I realize there is a lot of symbolism behind Conrad's writings, but perhaps I am not 'bright' enough to fully appreciate them. There is a lot of representation of the natural darkness of man's morality- but beyond this I didn't pick up too much. I struggled reading the book- it actually took me almost a year to finish it, even though it is quite short. Despite its short length- the chapters are painfully long, and I found myself desiring some kind of break.The introduction to the signet classic version (written by Albert Guerard) is an excellent aide to the book, and helped me see the different poionts of view regarding the book and it also helped me see why this book is so highly esteemed. Although I found the reading of this book slow and at times torturous, I believe Conrad has a correct (yet dark) view of human nature. Compared to Conrad's Secret Sharer, this book is much better."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's Heart of Darkness is considered a classic masterpiece of 20th Century literature, on par with Shakesphere and other literary greats. Of course, this means that the novella will not appeal to everyone. While it is a great work of description, social commentary, and philosophy, HoD is not an easy read, nor is it mindlessly entertaining by any means. Unless one is an English major or has done extensive background research on HoD, much of the richness and depth of the story will be lost on the average reader. Nevertheless, most serious readers could benefit from taking a stab at reading and understanding Heart of Darkness. Conrad's messages about man's depravity, conquest, and colonization are worth hearing, and perhaps are even more relevant in today's world.The most noticable aspect of Conrad's writing is his ambiguous, dense style. Often, it's hard to figure out exactly what is happening in the story. This tends to irritate readers who want the straightforward and concise. I, for one, find the hazy, ambiguous style to fit nicely. After all, this is a book about darkness, is it not? While Heart of Darkness will challenge even the most well-read, it is certainly worth tackling."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is, as the title implies, a journey into the darkest, most horrific regions of the human heart and soul. In the book, we see an example of exactly what a world of pain and chaos can do to not just one man's mind, but the minds of everyone that he comes in contact with. While we follow our hero, Marlowe, towards the climactic encounter with the enigmatic Mr. Kurtz, we get a powerful and intimate look into Africa during it's colonization and the horrors that were committed in the hunt for ivory. This book is a classic, and should be regarded as such by anyone that reads it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel has meaning, it has depth, sure ... I can see that. But just because a story has meaning and depth doesn't mean it's a great one, a great story doesn't just have that, it has to have wonderful execution too, and this one just doesn't make the cut. It's way too wordy, and I get the feeling that it's too pretentious - it's like the author gets all the mind-blowing adjectives he can find and stuffs it down your throat. And I can make other criticisms, but basically it's about the style, the execution. So yeah, I get it - I get what it's trying to say, but it's not an impact, you know?And please don't mistake me for some person who doesn't know how to appreciate fine literature. I love Oscar Wilde, among others. I just think that this might've been great if only he'd reached out in a more effective way. We can't just judge a story to be incredible just because it has incredible meaning. The execution counts for a lot. That's why we have writers, isn't it? To put fantastic thoughts into sentences - GOOD sentences, which justify the depth of the thoughts. PLEASE consider the point I'm making here. :)"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It is often remarked how extraordinary it is that Conrad, who could not speak a word of English until he was 21 years old, became such a superb stylist of the language. Personally, I find his style overly ornate and often as impenetrable as the jungle - and as turbid as the waters - of the Congo basin in which this story is set. For example, \\"We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign - and no memories.\\" Quite so. I was not in the least surprised to learn that English was not his native language.Heart of Darkness began as a short story and in essence remains one, despite being subsequently padded out and passed off as a novella. It lacks the development of character, theme or plot that would qualify it as a novel. What Apocalypse Now (Coppola's film, based on this book) did was to show how those elements could be developed.So what does Heart of Darkness have to offer? Authenticity, for one thing. The story is based closely on Conrad's actual experience and it shows. The river, the steamer, the jungle are all palpably real, as is the author's disgust at the treatment of the natives. This latter element has led many liberal-minded readers to see this book as an indictment of colonialism. But Conrad's sympathy for the Africans is curiously detached. They remain distant, exotic creatures and their plight is presented as if it were a deplorable case of animal cruelty.The story's structure is interesting. It begins and ends on a boat in the Thames estuary, where one of the passengers - after having made the very intriguing parallel between the Roman invaders of two millennia ago, sailing up the Thames for the first time, into the dark continent of Britain, with that of the European colonists entering Africa - relates the story of his adventure in the Congo.With Conrad's style being so much a matter of individual taste, with the ambiguous attitude toward the natives and with the thematic slightness of the work, it is not surprising that Heart of Darkness receives such mixed reviews. I would recommend it for anyone with a particular motive, such as an interest in colonial African history, or a curiosity to know the inspiration for Apocalypse Now, or simply a desire to sample the work of an author whom many consider one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"In Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, Marlow, a quiet sailor, sets out on the Congo River to meet Kurtz, a man who is said to be of great abilities. The entire story centers around Marlow and everything he encounters on this trip. This story is one of courage and strength, and it is one that I enjoyed very much. However, the depth of the story is what truly makes it an excellent one.While the plot of the story is a complex one, the themes and symbols really make the story. Any person could read the story and understand that Marlow joins the Company, after receiving help from his aunt, travels down the Congo, and experiences the civilization of the natives there. He is trying to get to a man named Kurtz, who is well known in the area. Kurtz civilizes the natives by using brutality. Many mini dramas occur as Marlow is traveling through the African jungle, but in the end Marlow finds that he got himself into a little more than he bargained for, and he also learns how brutal the Company has been to the natives, particularly Kurtz who thinks they should \\"kill the brutes.\\"The themes, however, reach beyond the simple good versus evil. The book explores imperialism and the hypocrisy surrounding it. What members of the company call \\"civilizing the natives,\\" is truly abuse of power. The members of the company use their stature against the natives, in order to get what they want: ivory. Also, madness is greatly illustrated in the book. Mental illness, as well as physical, occurs throughout the book to Kurtz, and it leads the reader to sympathize with the character. The madness is linked to the imperialistic power that Kurtz has. The only person that Kurtz has to answer to himself, and in the end that becomes more than he can bear.In the novella, there are several symbols, which add to the complexity of the story. One such symbol is darkness. Darkness is illustrated throughout the book in imagery, metaphor, and simile. The darkness is a symbol for the cruelty and imperialistic ideas that the Company has. The members of the Company treat the natives like they aren't human. They don't see value in the natives therefore they don't truly understand life in the Congo. They are there to gratify their greedy consciences, not to help another people.Fog is a symbol that plays hand in hand with darkness. It doesn't completely hide something from the reader or character's eyes. It simply distorts what is being seen. Fog in the story is used to lead the reader to making an inference, and then realizing that they were wrong. The use of fog keeps the reader hanging on because they want to try to figure out what is happening, just like the characters are trying to find their way.The many themes and symbols truly add to The Heart of Darkness.

There are also some people studies (the station manager who's longevity is owed to that he never gets sick and dies, the mysterious Mr. Kurtz dealing for ivory in the wilderness reaches . . . who dies by the way).Unfortunately, author Conrad's prose and process is so abstract that it was like trying to read something written by a drunk. Very drunk. The careless pronouns made it hard to figure out the current subject of interest.

It was also sometimes confusing on who was talking, between the main character, who opened the novel, and Marlow, who was telling the story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Though Joseph Conrad's famous novella, Heart of Darkness, can teach us much about human nature, it can also very easily put us to sleep. The powerful characters and their intriguing motives Conrad expresses in his novella opened our eyes to the extreme lengths people will go to in order to climb the social ladder ultimately becoming \\"top dog\\". It also exposed us to the harsh and often over-looked world of African racism in its rawest and truest form. This concept was quite new to us considering all we have previously been taught about racism was the overexposed aspect of racism in United States history. If only Conrad had made his writing as exciting and interesting as the in-depth themes he conveyed in Heart of Darkness, perhaps more readers would discover it in all its glory.A constant struggle for power is an underlying theme throughout Conrad's novella. It is interesting to watch the development of characters as their thirst for power strengthens. The Manager, for example, becomes more and more distressed and desperate to overpower Marlow each time Marlow opposes one of the Manager's decisions. This relationship is a fascinating study of human nature, and is very relatable to today's society. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for people to become so blinded by their desires, that they reach the point where they no longer remember why they desired it in the first place. Conrad's characters show us that the greed and yearning for supremacy seen in his book is actually much more common in our lives than we first assume.If you were to ask anyone in our age group about racism nine times out of ten they would respond with a fact or figure dealing with racism as a part of United States history, especially topics of slavery. Very little is taught about racism in other forms and in other locations. Heart of Darkness portrays a society in which the ones that are oppressed by racism are, not only, the people native to the land, but also the majority. After seeing the way the European settlers imposed their own society and beliefs upon the natives, it reminded us that racism and domination as a whole is not only seen in minority groups. The invading Belgium travelers oppressed the people native to the land solely because of their skin color. After investigation, it is obvious this prevalent theme can be easily found in the history of our own country, The Unites States. This unique form of racism can be found as far back in our own country's history as the way the first pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower treated the Native Americans despite the pilgrims having a smaller population.Despite the great educational and psychological aspects of the story we found it intolerably boring, complicated and complex. The writing was unnecessarily wordy, often times confusing us rather than conveying a story. We also found that there was a gratuitous amount of description throughout the story. Again, the extra and unneeded words often sidetracked us from the actual plot. The story line was full of unneeded fluff and pieces that did nothing to move the story along. We also were not fond of the frame narration literary style. It added further confusion to the plot and we did not see any particular benefits.Overall, we would not recommend Heart of Darkness to anyone looking for a light enjoyable read. For those looking for a story enriched with themes and new ways of seeing a society you thought you knew, then this may be the perfect book for you!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness by Joseph ConradOne of the first masterpieces of the 20th century and one of the key modernist text. This is a story that everyone should read, and Kindle edition provides the best format for the reading experience."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Set in the Belgian Congo during the 19th century Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, is a journey to the darkest corners of the wilderness and the human heart. The story is told by Marlow, a sailor, who journeys to the Congo to captain a river steamer and ends up on a expedition to save an extrodinary ivory trader by the name of Mr. Kurtz.Throughout this journey he encounters the raw brutality of colonialism in all its horror and greed. Conrad brings the reader to the frontier where men do savage things all for the spoils of conquest. This is in sharp contrast with other African adventure classics, such as King Solomon's Mines, which take a much more amiable view of the conquest of Africa.Conrad shows all this barbarism with vivid imagery. His description of the Congo wilderness brings it life with all the mystery and majesty it is due. Conrad's prose is magnificent; you feel like you are at Marlow's side throughout the whole story. However anyone thinking this is a fast paced thriller is mistaken. It plot moves at a leisurely pace and isn't as rushed as novels today.Another one of the beauties of this book is its re-readability. I first read it through without reading the introduction and I am glad I did. It let me interperet the meaning of the book without anyone else's influences and when I read the introduction at the end I found that there was a myraid of other themes that could be drawn from the story that I had not thought of. I am now reading it a second time in a new light. I suggest anyone reading it the first time to skip the intro and the footnotes until you've read it once. It will definetly make it a more enjoyable read.Not that it is not already an excellent book. Heart of Darkness is a literature masterpiece that shows the raw repungent character of colonialism and human nature with haunting power."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Many have complained that Heart of Darkness is difficult to read or that it doesn't make sense, but I think such reviewers miss the point of this novel. It is a deeply psychological novel, rather than a straightforward adventure story. As a psychological novel, there are lots of impressions, and a certain amount of jumping around within Marlow's consciousness. It is definitely worth reading to gain some insight on how man reacts when seperated from his civil society, and how the forces of colonialism corrupt those who come in contact with it. Check it out but be prepared for a wierd experience."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Ok, so I usually give books a chance, even if they are a class assignment but this book just made me aggravated. I mean it seems to enforce the strategy of using 40 words when 1 will do and just goes on and on and on. I mean I know that this book is classic and Conrad is an acquired taste but I just couldn't stand having to get through it. The only reason I was able to finish it at all was because I had the flu and was half delirious so I wasn't paying attention to what I was reading anyways (although this was only for the last 50 pages of it and my edition had like 180 pages). Anyways, I understand this is supposed to be a classic. It just isn't my taste."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book Heart of Darkness, written by Joseph Conrad is worth at least 4 stars, maybe even 4 1/2. Conrad's native language was Polish, but this book was written in english. This would make you think that it is confusing and hard to understand. This book is hard to understand, but people tend to think so for all the wrong reasons. This book is only 76 pages in length, but it is astonishing how much detail is crammed into those pages. In order to understand this book you must be willing to read it for months and go back to previous paragraphs to understand why things happened the way they did.Researching information about Conrad's life would also help in reading this book. Alot of people around his in his life died of various diseases. In this book he inflicts disease on Kurtz, who was given the disease because of having so much power and so little restraint. The heart of darkness represents the jungle, having no mercy toward human life."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"As a story within a story, Heart of Darkness is a morbid, third person account of Charlie Marlow's narration in his expedition both physically through the rigors of Africa and mentally via the levels of moral righteousness and social persona. This cleverly disguised social criticism is reminiscent to Lord of the Flies, however, Conrad's opinions on human savagery is expressed directly at historical events, rather than represented by desperate children, a la Golding.Evidently, the text offers a narration that is informal, littered with corrections, pauses, interruptions in trains of thought, and other elements common in conversation. Yet, Charlie Marlow's perception of the world is heavily influenced by an intellectual's views as his vivid imagery of people and places are laced with philosophical and abstract themes. The text is subsequently affected by these factors and offers the reader prose unlike the typical adventure or the pretentious, vocabulary-heavy political manifesto.Conrad assimilates his own experiences of European colonization into the fictional story. However, the greed of the Europeans and the atrocities committed against the native Africans are faithfully reproduced and depicted. The fact that the work is written from another person but based on Conrad's own experiences allows him to convey a message of despair without directly implying his own views-implementing them nonetheless. The reader is then given a sense of confidence in the material, unlike prototypical fiction, because they are derived from genuine observations.The majority of the work focuses on Marlow's occupation as an English sailor who is nave of the world outside the British isles-as he is unable to recognize locations beyond England (including the Belgian office he is employed at), why Africa is color-coded (the division of exploitable regions as agreed upon in the Berlin Conference), and many unrecognizable features of Africa, including its geography and inhabitants. This allows the author to explore certain observations that would've otherwise been overlooked by familiarity.Marlow's narration isn't of grizzled foreign experience or that of one who has embraced many cultures and traditions into his viewpoints. Rather, he creates a narrow perspective of the African environment augmented only by a lifetime of English customs. Conrad employs this method in order to demonstrate to the reader how a native Englishmen views the situation and who is not yet spellbound by the bounty of ivory-the captor of the imperialistic man's moral judgment.Throughout the short fiction, Marlow is unable to comprehend the situation enough to assess possible options on reaction. That is, his naivet&eacute; prohibits proper interpretation and judgment, and immerses the reader into the many thoughts flowing through his words attempting to realize the gravity of colonial imperialism and its subsequent effects on the native inhabitants-a trademark of the author's diction.Perhaps the greatest aspect of Conrad's haunting tale is the dual transformation of two characters-Marlow and Kurtz. Although their self-realizations reach pivotal points at different spans of time, \\"The horror! The horror!\\" adequately sums up their perceptions on imperialism-the European's self-proclaimed jurisdiction to plunder lands wherever they please. Comparatively to Lord of the Flies, an abundance of freedom leads to moral decline, but unlike the end of Golding's novel, Heart of Darkness concludes with the moral epiphany of Kurtz, then Marlow, without an abrupt ending. Harrowing details set the tone of the novella and progressing perspectives add gritty realism, concocting an evolved perception of mankind."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I must admit its a re-read for me that never gets old.there are so many classic things about the book to list"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Inspired by some of his trips to Congo - in which he saw the grim reality of imperialism - and the savage acts of arrogant civilized explorers, Conrad wrote this amazing tale that leads us through the glooming wilderness of Africa into the darkness of the minds of men.

Such a journey of the mind, as well as the body,to the farthest depths of the African jungle is one which takes thourough concentration on the part of the reader, even moreso than that of the narrator. This novel is not one of morals, conclusions, or even a solid theme. It is, however, a novel which explores the idea that insanity varies depending on the culture in which it is presented, and the idea that to be free of civilization's strangling hold is often worth the loss of one's sanity.

This is a great, dark, rich, mysterious little book--do read it!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"One of the great short novels in existence. On the surface, Conrad's Marlow is a first rate storyteller. Underneath, a psychoanalytical tale of man's baser animistic instincts comes forth, of descent into a primal state outside the moderating bounds of civilized accoutrements. Like Marlow, the reader will be left with the curse of a penetrating view of the world, no longer able to ignore the &quot;horror&quot;, unable to accept - or even tolerate - the pretense of the normal routine of &quot;civilized&quot; society. The reader will be doomed to look beneath the surface and see the beast that lurks within each soul, capable of savagery little imagined but now unforgettable. Conrad's literary talents were absolutely first rate - all the more remarkable for a man whose native tongue was Polish but wrote in English. Concise, penetrating, intelligent, unflinching prose which propels the reader forward on an ultimately illuminating journey of discovery of one's self. Heart of Darkness is a rare combination of great story telling and literary achievement, all in a very concise package."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, 1902 (Everymans's Library, together with \\"Youth\\" and \\"The End of the Tether\\")The book is about the meaning and possibilities of life in a universal context. The story is narrated by Marlow. He and his listeners are sitting in a boat on the Thames, the last words of the story are: \\"the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky - seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.\\" (162). In other words: The darkness, the demonic and scary character of the world is present everywhere, it is not only a quality of the wild African jungle in the 19th century, and not only European colonialists driven by greed and seduced by the power they have over the natives can fall victim to it.The story is unfolded as a drama, as a tragic fight between good and evil. What is pretty striking for a present-day reader is the melodramatic, black and white distinction between these two dimensions of life. Kurtz represents the tragic failure of somebody who starts out in the name of civilisation and humanity and ends up in the quagmire of perversion, murder, misuse of power. He is in sharp contrast with his idealistic confessions or intentions as they are put down in his eloquent texts or represented by his \\"Intended\\", the bride that Marlow visits at the end and to whom he misrepresents the last words of Kurtz (\\"The horror! The horror!\\") in order to maintain the young woman's \\"soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.\\" (152). In the same way as the narrator carries this young woman's purity and goodness to extremes he enhances the demonic, dark qualities in her counterpart, the black princess that was obviously the High Priestess of orgiastic pleasures in the other world, \\"a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman\\" (135), the representative of the wilderness, \\"the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul\\" (136).The scenes with the black worshippers around their god - Kurtz - have the character of grand, satanic opera.Conrad is full of contempt for Europeans plundering the black continent for purely materialistic purposes, and what they do is senseless to him and does not bear the mark of reality. The book can also be read as a quest for something real in an otherwise incomprehensible world. And Conrad can't deny that Kurtz found some form of reality that is frightening and admirable at the same time: \\"After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth..\\" (151). Conrad was not the first writer in that century to discover the lure of evil, of sadism and perversion, and Marlowe's hard struggle to keep up the torch of humanity in a sinsister world is not absolutely wholehearted and successful."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This short novel has taught me something interesting. It is possible for a supremely skilled writer to structure his fiction like a symphony. He can bring in the theme of \\"darkness\\" at the very beginning, and then let it lapse for a while as Marlowe makes his way down the African coast --- but with the theme recurring as various disconcerting facts are noted. This is the way a master symphonist works, with various themes intertwined, until the finale which ends the performance, with Darkness Visible and All-Pervading.This is an aspect of \\"style\\" (or \\"art\\") which none of my English teachers were smart enough to mention, perhaps because they were so taken with \\"critical theory\\" that they failed to understand the supreme work of art right under their noses.You don't have to be an aspiring writer to appreciate this superb novella --- one of the best things I have ever read.\\"Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn't touched. I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of somber pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror--of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision,--he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath--\\"'The horror! The horror!'\\""},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Everyone who thinks that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a work of Conrad's imagination, an existential comment on the human condition and the evils of colonialism in particular, that just happens to be set in this African colony out of many he could have chosen, should read \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\", by Adam Hochschild. In fact, just read the Publisher's Weekly Review of Hochschild's book at Amazon.com. Conrad was a witness to actual events in the Congo, and it was \\"his disgust\\" with what he personally observed that led to \\"Heart of Darkness\\". He has created fictional characters, but his descriptions of the atrocities practised by Kurtz, for example, were based on real person(s) and \\"actual events\\", as they say."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"GreedHeart of Darkness, the title of the novel has a deeper meaning than I believe was intended. Greed, which is said to be one the major themes that take place throughout the men's journey to the Congo. The hunger for the precious ivory tore the men apart, resulting in nothing good at all. Although this was not usually something that I would normally read, I really enjoyed Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"The Horror, The Horror.\\"With those words, Conrad summarizes the plunge into the moral abyss taken when a man with almost no societal restraints pursues self-aggrandizement and wealth. Conrad's prose is wrapped in steamy mist, fetid air, and bone-aching misery, enveloping the reader as he awaits the appearance of the mysterious Kurtz.As others have noted, Kurtz' arrival quickly becomes anti-climactic - perhaps because Conrad believed his lead-up held such moral weight that readers would simply graft it onto Kurtz; perhaps, because Conrad wanted to underscore the depravity of the man through understatement. If either was Conrad's thinking, the approach didn't work especially well for me.\\"The Horror, The Horror\\" - an almost Gothic form of storytelling - simply didn't tap into the life lessons Kurtz must have experienced, so we are forced to pump the practices of Colonialism (and, perhaps, Cannibalism) into Kurtz' character to discern them. At best, however, it's a guessing game.Much has been made of the fact that \\"Apocalypse Now\\" derives its story line and moral framework from Conrad's novel. Yet, it is another great work of cinema, \\"Citizen Kane\\", that demonstrates how an author can take his central figure's dying word (\\"Rosebud\\") and employ it as the springboard for a compelling exposition on a charismatic figure's fall from grace.Welles never left us hanging; Conrad does. Four stars for a (then-) courageous skewering of Colonialism, plus deft writing."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"One of the reasons I enjoy reading the classics of Literature is that they tend to highlight certain epochs and environments that no longer exist: they offer the reader a glimpse, or perhaps a longer gaze, into a way of life and society that has all but been swept away by modern sprawl and the dominance of Western culture. In Literature, one can frolic with the thieves of Victorian London, or hunt the Appalachians for red-coats; visit the Arabian peninsula a thousand years past or explore an Africa of unexploited majesty, an Africa where danger and death lurk in the sting of an insect bite or a chucked spear rather than the blight of AIDS or genocidal discord.The latter example comes, of course, from Joseph Conrad's novella _Heart of Darkness_, an autobiographical work concerning the depths of the 'dark' continent relatively unspoiled by the greedy decrees of parliament, but on the verge of massive and irrevocable change. The hounds of 'progress' have penetrated but not yet subsumed, and the jungles still contain an ancient, breathtaking wildness that leaves the narrator Marlow quaking with respect and primal fear._Heart of Darkness_ contains one of the finest builds of tension I've ever experienced on the printed page. Inundated with both the boredom of long travel and the moments of inexplicable terror that Africa conjures, Marlow's slow steamboat journey into the Congo wilds becomes as torturous for the reader as it is for the narrator, an awesome build of suspense that the actual climax of the book--the arrival at Kurtz's station--cannot really match...but then, it is always the ambiguous that haunts us; the mysterious and the unknown that furrows the feverish brow. Concrete, tangible adversaries can be fought against or at least acknowledged, while the brutish designs and desires that lurk under that impenetrable canopy, that seethe within the human heart, are far more difficult to confront, defeat, and master in turn.Conrad's style, short declarative sentences coupled with longer stream-of-conscious insights, is a delight to read. I enjoy this style of writing immensely, and find it communicates the central ideas of theme and story far more clearly that those with totally stripped or totally convoluted prose. _Heart of Darkness_ is told by a true master of the English language, and the fact that the author did not originally speak English makes this an even more remarkable feat-; or perhaps not, considering that Conrad was probably not exposed to any corruptions of the English language at a young, formulative age.Recommended."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's Heart of Darkness, while being a short book, is certainly energy consuming. Conrad's language emphasizes the tangled masses of the Congo's Jungles and the twisted nature of the characters. As the result of his stylistic devices, which create vivid images, the reader goes away feeling tangled. One looks back and mentally sees nothing but great green masses of tangled vines hanging from trees, and a massive wall of words.One thing that is indisputable is this: Conrad is a brilliant author. Upon examining his other books one realizes that Conrad can actually change his writing style at will. Every single tangled mass of words in the Heart of Darkness is nothing but elaborate emphasis on the plot and the overall imagery."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book must really be heard as well as read. (The best is the unabridged book on tape, read by Michael Thompson or Thomson?. It is as though Marlowe himself is speaking.) Perhaps the most difficult subject to deal with is the uneasy aspect of our history of corrupting, abusing or rather &quot;educating&quot; as we say those less well off or unknown to us, educating them to our ways, to our rational lives. Conrad addresses our history of abuse in the Congo and so the questionable ambiguity of doing good, as a disguise for our own rapaciousness in our self-serving actions. Who is more civilized? Who is more evil? The light Conrad shines is the illumination of the very soul of the complicated thicket of the primoridial jungle and the uneasy feeling of how deep our evil runs in the name of doing good and saving souls, perhaps ruining and laying waste to the beginnings, the basic desires of life. What good does civilization do in this case? Is restraint and greed part of civilization? Is it learned, is it part of this jungle or instead a part of &quot;all of Europe&quot;, as he says? This is an imprenetrable book, but only if you fail to recognize or peer into the darkness of your own heart."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"One often gets the impression when examining Amazon reviews and ratings of classics, that a good portion of those writing the reviews have been assigned the book as homework. English teachers everywhere feel the need to expose students to The Great Works apparaently without seeming to realize that often what they're doing is creating resentment toward something that the student might appreciate in later life.I know it happened to me more than once in school, and I always =enjoyed= reading, unlike many of my peers. (It helps to revisit classics on one's own time years later.)While nowhere near as severe as the culture shock one gets from reading Dickens or Shakespeare, the significance of Conrad's work is going to be lost on someone who doesn't know anything about the &quot;colonization&quot; of Africa, and today's kids may not even know enough about Vietnam to feel the impact of a work that was so amazingly descriptive a situation 60 years into the future.This is unfortunate because even one who enjoys the more adventurous and suspenseful aspects of the work isn't going to get what all the fuss is about unless he has a better background in history than modern education is likely to give.Despite all this, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is one of the more accessible classics this side of Mark Twain. Conrad doesn't subject the reader to hundreds of pages about whaling (Melville) or steep himself in the subtleties of contemporary politics (Dickens). It's also short and doubtless contributes to the camp who believe the novella is the optimal literary form.On the other side, tt is a dark, rather brooding look at Man as a whole, as well as individual men, so you may want to have some Twain or Thurber on-hand to apply as needed afterwards."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Want to take a trip into the darker side of the human soul? Want to read a book which will challenge your grasp of good and evil? Then read this and ponder the evil potential in all of us."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"While justifiably a classic of 20th Century literature, Conrad's depiction of a journey up the Congo River will not find favor with everyone. Because he had actually made such a journey himself, Conrad is able to give ornate descriptions that bring this mysterious locale to life before our eyes - at least, for those whose response to the printed word is largely visual. To those readers who, like this reviewer, are more intrigued by plot and character than by the appearance of a person or place, Conrad's lengthy descriptions of the river and its banks may seem tiresome, mere delay as the plot slowly unfolds.And is it ever slow. This measured pacing is supposed to create a strong element of suspense as we wonder what will happen when Marlow finally meets the mysterious Kurtz, but casual readers should be forgiven for not really caring. The journey itself doesn't get exciting until the attack comes, a good three-quarters of the way through the book, so those hoping for action and adventure will find little to their taste. So why is this novel considered such a masterpiece?Apart from Conrad's turgid prose, the real power of this story is in its philosophical content. Marlow's physical journey into Africa parallels a psychological journey into the darkness of the human condition. He seeks a Kurtz who has been described as an emissary of science and progress, the best man the company has ever sent to Africa, a veritable superman whose humanity, sensitivity, leadership skills, and practical know-how have enabled him to accomplish amazing things in these most difficult of circumstances. In effect Kurtz represents Colonialism itself; he is the living proof that European Imperialist policies can improve conditions in the colonies while netting a profit for the home country. But what Marlow finds is something very different, and the equivocal conclusion forces the reader to make his own decisions about the moral choices that are made. For many, the story makes a strong indictment of the atrocities perpetrated by Kurtz, and by extension, the colonial powers behind him, and by further extension, most of human history, which is characterized by the company manager as the process by which the strong take what they want from the weak, using brute force.This is not a \\"fun\\" read; there's no trace of humor or romance as we use the term. Women have only the tiniest roles, and there are passages that have been roundly criticized as offensive to Africans. If those concerns don't bother you, and you can get past the slow plot, there are some heavy points being made here. For the rest of us, Apocalypse Now is a fantastic film that sets pretty much the same story in war-era Viet Nam. It won't get you through your English class, but it's a far more entertaining work of art."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'll be honest - \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a great, great work of literature, but I don't love the writing style, and it is not a pleasure to read (for me at any rate).But it is not quite as hard as its reputation, and it is every bit as important. If there is one, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is the definitive statement on European colonialism, especially in Africa. The symbolic meaning of the story is powerful and unanswerable.The Norton Critical Edition of any book is usually the best - (not always: with Shakespeare I generally prefer the Signet Classics, and for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" at least the Longman Cultural Edition is the best) - and \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is no exception. Like so many other books, you haven't understood this until you've understood what has been said about it. The NCE gives the best collection of critical essays available for someone new to the book.Let me recommend a couple of easier reads for people interested in the genre of literature about colonialism. First isBurmese Days, which is one of Orwell's better books. It is a much more literal, tangible look at the realities of colonialism, and should probably be read before \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" The other isThe Quiet American (Viking Critical Library), which is less critical of colonialism, but still a very good look at the motivations of various people involved. I am very critical of \\"The Quiet American,\\" but it is still among the first books that anyone interested in the literature of colonialism ought to read."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"... I reread Heart of Darkness because my \\"guys\\" reading group included two who had not ever read it. The story stands up far, far better than I would have guessed. Conrad is really superb, and this shortish novel could well persuade new readers that \\"literary\\" stuff is worth their while. I had forgotten how subtle, how grown-up Conrad's expectations of his reader are. Truly quite marvelous.With trepidation, I splurged on the Norton edition, even though I am pretty hostile to English-Professor post-modern posturing and nonsense. I am glad I got it, however. The wealth of historical documents help make the then-contemporary setting come real. The big surprise for me was Chinua Achebe's fine essay. While \\"bloody racist\\" is still over the top, Achebe has a case of some importance, and argues it well. It is even a comfort to find that the knee-jerk responses by assorted literature professors are indeed just as much postie poo as I had expected. (It's always a pleasure to find that one's unexamined prejudices are warranted after all.)A particular pleasure for me was talking about the book with my daughter, who has taught it to her honors high school English class. She has developed views, and I learned really quite a lot from listening to her. Book, $11.90; my time, $free; finding out your daughter has deep insight and can teach you, PRICELESS.In short, wonderful story and useful edition."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"&quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; is arguably my favorite novel of all time (tied with Hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;). Thrilling in every way, this is the only book that seeped into me. Never before has an author created a mood so perfectly that you actually FEEL the darkness. Written masterfully as a person retelling a story someone else was telling, the book has a reality on both levels that in unbelievable. You NEED to read this book! It's short and gripping so it shouldn't take too long. You might not be a changed person when you're through, but you will be awed by Conrad's brilliance. (Even if you hate the book, it's undeniable.)"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This exactly and literally is what \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is all about, the search for meaning. We search for meaning as we read the story of Marlow who is searching for meaning in his search for Kurtz...who, guess what, has been involved in his own search for meaning.Much is, or should be, obvious here. Conrad is depicting the horror of colonization. Some readers got lost here and thought he was defending colonization, but careful reading proves the opposite. Racism is also crucified here, but some readers miss that. The big difficulty is the prolific use of the word \\"nigger\\" which had a significantly different connotation in the time that Conrad wrote than it does now. The connotation had changed drastically, and the reader should be aware of the difference between the 19th century English connotation and the 20th century American connotation.The writing is deeply textured. Conrad goes into exquisite detail and for those who flow into his description, the story becomes more absolutely real and intense.This book is rewarding to those who have the patience. It's a shame that it's required reading in high school. Most high schoolers haven't had the living experiences that would help them understand the point of the story."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's powerful book &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; tells the narrative of Marlow, a character drawn much from the author's own experiences in the Congo, as he travels the great river unto the heart of the uncharted continent of Africa and finally to meet the enigmatic Mr. Kurtz. As he ventures farther away from civilization and further into the heart of darkness, he discovers Mr. Kurtz, a remarkable man who at once was disgusted at the world that has developed about him, and yet unable to escape it.Mr. Kurtz left Europe for Africa as a prodigal employee of &quot;The Company&quot;, which controls ivory trade in its region. In venturing further into the continent, he rose to become the head of a trading post, where he finds himself the uneasy ruler elevated by the natives. Perhaps it is a lesson in how absolute power can corrupt man. The story of Mr. Kurtz itself is an enchanting story of tragedy: how he has risen into power, to be worshipped as a god by the natives, as he leaves behind his society where he had previously struggled to be more accepted.This last aspect is unfortunately easy to be overlooked, instead focusing on the more explicit narriation of the evil brought by society onto the heart of the uncharted continent. This work is a bitter protest against the systematic exploitation that the Europeans slowly brought into Africe.The book's powerful use of prose and poetic abstraction beings evocation of the suffocating effect of being taken away from our societal rules and placement, to be subjected to the overwhelming power of nature and the mysterious and untamed. Unfortunately the same writing style that invokes powerful, vivid imagery, makes it hard to follow this book in a few places.This work was the basis of Francis Coppola's &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, a critically renowned adaptation of the story cast in the Vietnam War. The main difference is that in this book we got to know Mr. Kurtz a little more intimately through the friends and family members who came later in the story to collect his writings, and thus become a more informed witness to his tragedy."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"&quot;The necessity which impelled me to go to sea and to become a writer was a hidden, obscure necessity, a completely masked and unaccountable phenomenon,&quot; Joseph Conrad wrote in &quot;A Personal Record.&quot;Conrad's most famous work, based upon his traumatic experience in the Belgian Congo in 1890, is the novella &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; a Symbolist masterpiece narrated by the eloquent, brooding Marlow, to whom, as to his creator, &quot;the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine.&quot; &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is surely one of the perennial best works of literature in English literature. Though Conrad's vision is tragic (he might have said realistic), his tone is often comic. His dense, convoluted prose, English uneasily qualified by undercurrents of the Polish and French that were the author's earlier languages, is sometimes obscure. Every writer knows that melodramatic expressions of despair about the progress of composition can become a kind of fetish, relied on to ward off the onset of a genuinely catastrophic blockage. But in Conrad's case, despair seems to have been the condition for writing anything at all - a state of affairs he did his best to exacerbate by making it a practice to borrow money from publishers against books he had not yet written. He was unlike most writers who spend the better part of their lives sitting in a room, turning sentences around, he himself spent some 20 years gathering experience and adventures as a sailor and explorer of strange, exotic places. The &quot;shadowy country&quot; of inextinguishable desires and fears&quot; that shaped his fiction was not only a literary construct, but in many cases grew out of an actual landscape whose emotional and physical geography the author had explored himself.This story is a vision of a man who knew that the real darkness lay not in the jungles of the Congo, but within his own solitary heart..."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. Conrad's prose is descriptive without being tiresome, and draws out the deepest feelings from the reader. I did not find his portrayal of the African slaves racist in the least. He is writing from a white man's perspective and his descriptions of the slaves are honest. The deception of the supposedly noble intention of the British imperialists is clearly laid out through beautiful imagery (e.g., blindfolded woman carrying a candle).I am eternally grateful for the English class that required me to this book; I believe this book opened my eyes to many things in this world and my comprehension of imagery in literature and poetry has increased tremendously after reading and dissecting this book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is a work of endless rewards and layers. Never mind the racial elements-- they truly don't matter to Conrad's purpose. And do force yourself to work through every meaty, carefully drawn sentence. This work is a model of compactness, a work in which every single line counts.Consider it as the Anti-Huck Finn-- Marlow travels up a river (instead of down) and as he leaves more of civilization and restraint behind, he becomes worse (instead of better). Compare it also to *Lord of the Flies* (look, in particular, at LOTF last paragraph) as a treatment of what lies within the deepest part of humans.It's a challenging and unsettling work, but it has great rewards both in writing and in the ideas contained."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Several negative reviews of Heart of Darkness seem to have been written by bitter high school students. In sum, their sentiment is: \\"Don't read this book if you don't like good stories.\\"Huh?It should be more like, \\"Don't read this if you aren't willing to study it.\\" These \\"students\\" must understand that a superficial reading of a novel will NEVER yield anything useful. Plot is not the only way to judge the merits of a story. What defines a classic is not always what happens, but how the events are told to us.Conrad's writing is not complex and vague by accident. The reviewer who remarked that it takes Marlow several convoluted sentences to describe the river misses the point that Marlow is not the kind of narrator who can describe something precisely. It is more like an impressionist painting. Conrad's style recreates those blurred images we all have when we try to recollect an experience. It is a representation not of what all men know, but what an individual sees.***SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH***Marlow is \\"unsteady\\" on purpose. We are supposed to question whether he necessarily is against imperialism. This book cannot be said to be strictly anti-imperialistic, since Marlow lies at the end to preserve Kurtz's reputation. Contradictions in Marlow's character are Conrad's consious doing.Contrary to popular belief, good novels DO require close readings and analysis to be understood. Authors don't just want to write a good story: they want their story to spark discussion of the plot, themes, AND narrative technique. Conrad didn't include all those adjectives as filler.If any of these reviewers go on to study literature at a university, I'm sure they will one day be embarassed that they made their ignorance public. I know I've come off as pretentious, but this literature does not deserve to be brushed aside because it is complex. Rather, it demands a close analysis. Judge the novel only after you truly understand it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Everything Achebe says about this book is absolutely correct.

To me, books should be like music. The message should be in the words, not by deciphering &quot;now what was the meaning of the tattered book in the hut?&quot; Many praise this book as literary genius, but I think it was no more than a boring story (hard to get through it's measly page number). If you want the story told in a good way, rent Apocalypse Now; it's based (albeit more loosely) on the book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Anyone considering this a classic needs a support group"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If you like entertaining stories, you will hate this one. Conrad is continually dark and depressing. In many cases, he makes the story disturbing. The narrator (Marlow) rambles on about his venture into the Congo to unwilling listeners. Conrad uses so much ambiguous language it is almost difficult to grasp the story itself. The wording and language the novella uses, in a way, creates a feeling of confusion for the reader. The number of adjectives thrown into a sentence tends to take the readers attention away from the story. However, the plot is somewhat interesting, if you can get around the style of language used throughout the rest of the story. I am still a bit confused about how this book can be considered a \\"classic\\" even after reading it. Any underlying meaning or message was lost in the rambling paragraphs of this short novel. In essence, this novella is more for a reader with an acquired taste for 19th century literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Is it wrong to want more? I just wanted an ending equivalent to Apocolypse Now. I wanted a more climactic ending. I wanted some passion--yes, perhaps a raunchy sex scene with Kurtz's girlfriend at the end. I even wanted to see Kurtz' head on a stick. Am I asking too much? I think not. Even so, there's something to be said for a novella that inspired Apocolypse Now. Indeed Apocolypse Now at least tried to remain somewhat faithful to the storyline of Heart of Darkness. I read it to see just how faithful. It's a tight little novel. Just that Apocolypse Now eclipses Heart of Darkness so completely, Heart of Darkness is left...in the dark."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book makes no sence.

The first and second time I was under the pressure of time and grades for high school and later college. As the book is short in length, both teachers only gave one or two days to read the book. At least for me, it's a dense book. The further into the story I get, the harder it is to read. It's as if the writing style mimics the growing darkness of the hinterland as Marlow gets closer to finding Kurtz. Kurtz, now, is, in my humble opinion, a let down. All through the book he's played up as this superhuman man who knows the wilds of Africa better than any one and is of such a character that he has devotees! Yet when he is finally found, he is but a husk of a man, insane from illness and is only in the story in person for a couple of pages. Even after Marlow has met him face to face, he continues to sing the man's praises!

Be sure you can understand hard books or else the meaning and the time you took to read this will be useless and wastedIt is basically about a man named Marlow who visits a great man who lives in the heart of the congo, or in the Heart of Darkness. But what he learns from this guy, Kurtz, and how krutz influences all the tribes should mean something different about mankind and how they are weak to everyone who reads this book. The moral isn't written down, you really have to think hard becuase it doesn't end like normal books.This book is written diffenently then you may expect. the whole book is in quotes basically. if you try to speed-read, you will be lost very quickly. Try to read this book out loud in your head and maybe slowly to comprehend what marlow is saying.

A must for those who love the thrill of the hunt."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I hate to give away anything to people reading this for a review. To say this book was &quot;lazy&quot; is unfair, and moral ambiguity might apply to Kurtz (I still doubt this -- we know too little besides heresay!) but definitely not to Marlow.Conrad wrote this as a story being told through the eyes of a sailor (Marlow). As we learn second and third hand about Kurtz, we never fully get a picture of what he was prior to the jungle. We also learn about Marlow, an ordinary man, somewhat sailor who was given an assignment he wasn't fully prepared to deal with, but then again who is? Marlow struggles with the concept of &quot;the savages&quot; and yet at one point comes to the realization that they are &quot;kinship&quot; to him.In the process of looking at Kurtz, the jungle, the people he does seem to drift away from his preconcieved notions of morality...and yet, the fact Marlow is aware of this suggests it is not ambiguous, but relative. Morality not just in thought, but also in action when he manages to stay with Kurtz's &quot;Intended&quot; despite his feelings of despair and urges to leave. He can't speak the truth, one that would absolutely ruin a person.This is only one take, you can have tons. There isn't an easy way to summarize this story in a paragraph. But to say it was a story about a guy named Kurtz in the jungle misses some of the more subtle points."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I felt I was sitting across from Marlow, who is telling the story of his experience in the Congo. This novel is different from most in that it is written so that the reader is listening to someone's story related rather than the reader feeling s/he is there as the story happens. The style matches that of someone telling you his experience as you listen. This makes the style somewhat choppy and sometimes confusing as to who is speaking, the narrator or another character. Nonetheless, I found myself gripped by the tale. I read the book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The reason this book is &quot;convoluted&quot; and &quot;hard to understand&quot; is that it is being told aloud by Marlow; it is written not as a novel but as a spoken story or speech.

Civilisation is that set of rules, norms and ethics that society shoves into our diaphragms with huge force.Who am I? Am I a number in society, or what?This is the ever present question that Conrad asked, and through leaving civilisation he left the jail of society.

The setting could have easily been the American West of the early 19th Century.Conrad has an amazing mastery of the English language especially when you consider he never spoke it until he was almost twenty years old.If you are looking for a challenge, read this book because Conrad has wonderful insight into the darkness of men's soul.

I actually began to like it after a while, and the use of language and symbolism was fascinating. I read this novel as part of a project for a class. My theme was the wasteland of modern society, and I studied the grail legends, world religions, mythology and the work of Eliot before I actually read Conrad. I understood him a lot better and got a lot more out of his work because of all the backgroud information I had. There are a lot of similarities between Eliot and Conrad. Conrad's main message is actually facinating, and there are a variety of different angles that that message can be viewed from. &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; actually has a lot of meaning in the modern world. Just as Kurtz's true character was revealed as hollow when he was removed from the constraints of society, the novel calls us to examine the state of our own souls.

The European mindset limits comprehension of the jungle and its aawesome power.

The word &quot; genius&quot; has become mundane, but I find no other word that can describe a fraction of Conrad's writing in Heart of Darkness. I thought this novel would be boring and dense, and instead it turned out to be the most amazing book I have yet read. It endeavors so much and completes it so &quot; eloquently.&quot; Marlow is what everyman should become at some point, and Kurtz--what can describe Kurtz? He is the phantom, the divinity of some other world. Even if this novel was read on a superficial surface; the descriptions and narrative are explosive and paint a picture that one can almost touch. It's hard to think that this was all in words and is held by two covers..because it is like holding burning dynamite. I'm going to be reading this many more times and for many more years to come. Because how many more ways can I interpret &quot; the horror, the horror&quot;?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is all symbolism, and that is what causes many readers so slog through it, only to proclaim it &quot;boring&quot; after finishing. The story itself offers little, but the deeper meanings and subtle inferences are extremely satisfying. Conrad uses a lot of images to lull the reader into a hazy state, like the &quot;brooding gloom&quot; used five times in the first few pages. If you can look further, you will be richly rewarded.The Norton Critical Edition offers some wonderful essays about the book, which will provoke a lot of careful consideration, if you take the time to read them. Particularly fascinating is Achebe's scathing indictment of Conrad as a racist. I personally think that the racist overtones in Heart of Darkness are part of the scene that Conrad is setting and not intended as 'propaganda' for racism, but the essay was fascinating, and forced me to reevaluate the book's meaning."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The single best English language novel ever written? Possibly. And I am not the only one who holds this opinion. Volumes have been written about this work. There are great lessons here and they are not hard to find, but it does take some imagination. A brilliant work, as is much of Conrad's writing. It must be remembered that English was not his native language which makes all this even more wonderful."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is not a particularly enjoyable book to read, but if you are willing to pour over it, there is a deeper meaning to be found. Practically everything and everyone in the book is symbolic, and this is why the book is so tedious to read &quot;for fun&quot;. So, if you are the sort of person who loves finding symbolism and hidden meanings in seemingly pedestrian ocurrences, buy several copies of this book. If you are looking for a nice, easy, straight read, don't buy it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"One of the most powerful stories ever written, and the fact that Conrad himself had a similar experience that the story was based upon makes it even more powerful.

Its statements about human nature may have more relevance today than when they were first printed. The film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; went far beyond 'burrowing' from this story, and therefore repeats Conrad's themes in more ways than one. &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; may seemingly depict the darker side of greed and deception, but actually, the underlying theme alludes to something much worse, although seemingly innocuous....The 'hero' of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; embodies all of the virtues of his society. Unfortunately, he goes a little too far; he embodies these values a little too much. As a result, he loses his humanity. Ironically, his monstrous behavior actually epitomizes the values held most dear by those who interface with him.&quot;The Secret Sharer&quot; reveals the flip side of the argument presented in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. This time, the main character falls into the extreme of superficility. As the captain of a ship, he supposedly acts as a model of propriety for his subordinates to follow. In fact, the captain's superficiality goes to such extremes that he lies and does other things to help a fugative to escape from justice. The captain does these things not out of any moral concerns, but rather because the fugative resembles him. The captain's amorality may could seem like immorality, if the reader has not encountered people as similarly lacking in depth.Conrad spent time as a seaman himself, and therefore knew the implications of the actions of his charactors. From that context, he saw how circumstances called for group effort in matters of survival. He sets many of his stories in such settings not merely out of familiarity, but rather to relate these powerful statements."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's rich imagery takes this exploration of the human soul and transcends it to a spiritual sourjourn.&quot;The horror, the horror&quot;."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I first read this tale when I was fifteen and its power and craftsmanship has only increased in stature...I've read it countless times since.

As I turned the fourth page, I realized that 'Apocalype Now' was taken from it, if not word for word, then tought for thought. Nevertheless, the power of Conrads imagery is so overwhelming, that I found myself holding my hand over my beating heart, while imagining myself on that river steamer, making my way into the heart of Africa, into a world where men existed without knowledge of any life outside there own villages. I immediately went out and purchased his other titles before I'd finished 'Heart Of Darkness', just so that I would not be without them, should I suddenly finish the one that I was reading, and wish to go immediately to the next. If you wonder about the boundaries of human experience, this book will not disappoint!H"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad has written a classic novella which delves into the depths of a mind filled with darkness. The story opens with Captain Marlow sitting aboard a boat on the Thames River. As day turns to night, he proceeds to tell the tale of his journey up the African Congo River to three of his companions, who don't really seem all that interested. His journey is in search of the enigmatic Kurtz who is reputed to have set himself up as a God-like figure among the natives. Marlow's journey is one of self discovery, but also discovery of the darkness embedded into the human heart.Conrad used decidedly descriptive language in Heart of Darkeness. Though this is usualy a quality that adds to a novel, for the average reader, Conrad's language can heighten their confusion a draw away from the plot. Unless the reader has a infinitely sophisticated vocabulary and extensive knowledge of the english languag, it is virtually impossible to have an exact grasp on the whole plot at all times.Another criticism i have of Heart of Darkness is the storyline. Conrad appears to have left it untill the last 15 pages of his novella to introduce any action. For the good majority of the story, Marlow is either at one of the company's various stations or on his steamboat, the whole time musing about the mysterious Mr Kurtz. The reader begins to wonder whether they are actually going to meet Kurtz before they go insane from the novella's lack of progression.In conclusion, though i am able to appreciate that Heart of Darkness has its merits, it is hard to recognise these merits when just understanding the plot is a challenge."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness is a sad story of the reality of the Congo in Africa. The characters, such as the natives, the cannibals, truly touch your heart. Marlowe, the main character of this novel, is confronted with the real creator of this slavery and gets to see what the real Heart of Darkness looks like."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Many people find the writing style of those who are considered \\"classic\\" writers to be dull. I'm not one of those people and have enjoyed a large number of classics. However, in this case, I did find the book to be boring. The aim was to create a psychological exploration of Kurtz - a man on the \\"frontier\\" in Africa - an exploration that shows the extremes of horror and despair amongst varying circumstances, and one that unfolds alongside a physical exploration of Africa.This aim was not achieved as I found it just too dreary. It's not that the pacing was slow - plenty of great works have slower pacing. It's that it was slow and the actual writing didn't make up for it. Perhaps Conrad's other stuff is better."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When I first started reading this book, It was all just words. As a high school senior, it was a little too difficult to understand, but after many class discussions ans \\"socratic seminars\\" I really started to understand it. This book is definately not my most favorite, but it's also not my least favorite either. I won't reveal the ending, but it is a really strong ending. \\"The Horror! The Horror!\\" are the last words spoken of Kurtz, and even though it's the end of the novel, it still leaves the reader wondering about it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When reading the introduction of a book, any book, I always grow suspicious when I'm told that repeated readings will unlock the book's true majesty. Unlike, perhaps, the providers of such advice, I tend to read in a manner that allows absorption of the material on the first try. God willing, we are given but 75 years on this earth and innumerable books to consume, yet somehow, to truly understand Conrad, we've got to read HIM over and over again. This doesn't seem to be my problem. It seems to be his.Heart of Darkness is a novella in which a man named Marlow recounts his journey up the Congo in search of Mr. Kurtz, an ivory trader. At just over 100 pages, the book is a model of literary economy, but it's gift of brevity is also it's curse. Marlow and Kurtz never fully develop as characters and, subsequently, I didn't really care what happened to them. True, I enjoyed the content, but without once making a connection to the protagonist.Heart of Darkness is, for all intents and purposes, a good read with some fine interwoven philosophy, but I fail to see how it merits the traditional adulation and controversy it receives. Because of today's hot-button issues of race and colonialism, perhaps it insinuates itself into popular culture leaving more behind than it should (eg. reviewers whose interminable parade of paragraphs come only by way of projection). Simply put, however, Heart of Darkness is a good short story about a restless seafarer in search of a jungle-addled company man. It rates 4 stars. Nothing more and nothing less."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"After reading this book, I was sort of disappointed. I guess I was expecying a bit more action, rather than so much detail. Some people like the idea of detailing and description. To me this book has too much description, and the paragraphs seem to just go on and on. I often had to go back to read the paragraph or page again just to understand it. After watching Apocalypse now, I actually understood the book version a whole lot better. The main character still narrates the story but it helped me to have a visual to understand what was going on. This book is not terrible but the book was difficult for me to read and understand completely."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book Heart of Darkness was a book about a man named Marlo who went on a journey down the Congo River in Africa. I found the storyline of the book to be very good. It was a great story about what happens along his way and the people he meets. It allows us to imagine what it was like at that time period in Africa. The writing style of the book, on the other hand, was difficult. Conrad wrote very in very large paragraphs, which bored me. It was confussing at some parts what he was talking about and what he meant by it. He would give you like five adjectives in one sentence. It was hard to have an image in my head of what it was like there. The beginning of the book was hard to follow at first but then I figured out was actually going on. It was a very distrubing book. It made you see and try to understand what things were like back then, which was that there was a lot of racism throughout his journey. Overall the book was just okay. It was that exciting to read and difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is truth. It is the book in which you find yourself. You find the evil, the twisted, disgusting impurities of your psyche. The jungle, the beating, sweaty, humid jungle, is your soul, and you are lost in the darkness. Conrad deconstructs the human soul and the darkness within, and in the process writes the greatest novel in history"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"To me the most intriguing aspect of Conrads fiction is his use of invented narrators because the invented narrator lends his stories a peculiar subjectivity. For Heart of Darkness he uses Marlow. By using Marlow to tell the tale Conrad can both relate his story and show the effect such a tale has on its teller. But Marlow is not the only teller as Conrad himself occupies a place outside the tale, an authorial space, and he is free to comment on both teller and tale from another vantage point altogether. I think this priveleged positioning is akin to the place of the audience in classic theatre. To Aristotle the great advantage of theatre was that the audience member could learn the lessons of the characters on stage without having to go through their experiences in the real world.I think it is interesting that some professors teach this book as a cautionary tale using Kurtz as an example of what happens when one goes outside the ranks of (white)civilization. While others read Kurtz's story as an indictment of that civilization because Kurtz is just doing what other colonizers are doing but in a more extreme way. Kurtz has simply given up the pretense that the white man is bringing \\"civilization\\" to Africa. Kurtz's madness is one in the same with the madness that belies any such colonial endeavor. It is dehumanizing to both the colonizer and the colonized and that is perhaps the point that makes this a great tale.Marlow remains puzzled by the whole thing to the very end. Africa has obviously gone to work on his imagination as the most powerful passages are his ruminations about the primal past he has journeyed into, but as well as journeying into the past he has journeyed into the \\"heart of darkness\\" which is not the same thing as the heart of Africa, but rather the heart of man. Conrad uses Marlow brilliantly to show how difficult it is to reconcile civilization with his profound knowledge of human nature. Marlows way of keeping things in balance is to tell the tale of Kurtz and other tales, as we are told that this is \\"another one of Marlows inconclusive tales\\".By using the invented narrator as the main character Conrad is able to tell two stories at once, Kurtz's and Marlow's. The way Marlow tells the story is inconclusive for it is never clear just what makes one man stop short at the invisible and perhaps merely imaginary, though necessary, perimeters that we call civilization & another cross over them.But it should not be overlooked that although Kurtz is an obvious example of colonialisms excesses, all those in the process of extracting ivory from central Africa were committing a violation upon the African people. The Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe has written an essay in which he calls Conrad a racist. I don't think that is true but Achebe in his books offers a valuable and contrasting vision of Africa remarkably different than the one in Conrads book. Achebe writes of the Igbo tribe which lived very near the region \\"Heart of Darkness\\" takes place in. In Things Fall Apart he describes the very peaceful Igbo tribe and how it was forever destroyed by the arrival of the white colonists."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Marlowe must travel up the Congo river, find the mythical ivory trader Kurtz, and take him back to the coast. In each step of the journey, Marlowe lives in an opressive, dehumanizaed atmosphere, surrounded by cruel employees of an ivory-trading company, and by black slaves. After days of tense travel in the midst of the jungle, Kurtz is found. And oh!, he is found to be more than just a legend. An ill Kurtz reigns on a closed universe, with a total absence of any points of reference to the outside world. Kurtz has gone deep into the heart of darkness. Conrad's prose is dense, precise, accurate. The tale is elusive, nuanced. You have to guess what is going on and, especially, what has happened. In the end, it is Kurtz himself who summarizes the book: &quot;The horror! the horror!&quot;."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Book arrived shrink wrapped, in excellent condition, on time and as described. Would order from this supplier again."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Marlow, who has been hired as a ferry-boat captain, narrates this story which is set in an unnamed place but which the reader assumes to be somewhere in Africa due to certain references. For a major part of the length of the novella, Marlow is trapped at his ivory-trading company's central station, waiting for spare parts to arrive for his boat so that he could begin his journey to one of the inner stations managed by Kurtz, an enigmatic trader who is supposedly more successful than the rest of the agents and traders combined. Marlow looks forward to meeting the man having heard numerous stories about him that grant the man an almost legendary status. When the upriver voyage actually begins and Marlow arrives at Kurtz's station, he notices that Kurtz's building is surrounded by stakes driven into the ground and topped with human heads. This leads Marlow to change his revered opinion of Kurtz to the other extreme where he hates him enough to want to kill him. Finally, Kurtz, who seems to be deathly ill, is carried back to the civilization on the steamer but dies on the way.Conrad's novella is just about a hundred pages in length but feels much longer due to the lack of a narrative drive. For nearly half the length of the book, nothing really happens and Conrad spends an incredible amount of time just describing the scenery and the weather. After a while, the book ceases to be atmospheric and becomes tediously mundane in its description of the place. Conrad, who could not speak English until he was in his twenties, keeps rolling out adjectives after adjectives, seemingly relishing his newly-obtained command of the language.When the steamer actually begins its journey, we are presented with more descriptions, this time of the river and the surrounding forest. Both the boat and the story creep forward at a maddeningly slow pace. When Marlow notices the human heads on stakes, his awe and reverence for Kurtz instantly transforms into hatred without even meeting the man. He seems to assume that Kurtz was a brutal man who used fear and violence to force the natives into submission. This is a huge leap into arriving at a conclusion. After all, Kurtz was right in the middle of nowhere, deep within the jungle, and the human heads could have been a ritual where the natives placed the heads of those who died naturally up on stakes.Conrad does not let the narrator and Kurtz meet early in the book, and even when they do meet, Kurtz is too ill to speak coherently and is therefore unable to converse with Marlow. This was a really weird decision by Conrad; he should have let Marlow, who was a fan of Kurtz, meet the man, and slowly through their interactions, changed Marlow's opinion of Kurtz. This would have been a much more reasonable and logical approach to the story. But Conrad shies away from such direct story-telling and prefers his readers to do the story-telling for him. It is a good thing to let the readers do a good bit of thinking on their part but Conrad leaves huge sections of plot up to the readers' imagination and takes being oblique to new levels.'Heart of Darkness' is another drab attempt at writing a psychologically acute novel full of insights into the dark recesses of the human mind. But, it falls way too short and ends up being just a silly, muddled story where the narrator spends more than half of his story describing the trees and the heat of the jungle. The dialogues sound forced and there are no engaging human interactions between the characters of the book.G. K. Chesterton once said that a good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author. This is very true about 'Heart of Darkness' which tells us about the lack of Conrad's imagination and his utter failure as a story-teller.There are a few above-average passages in the book, but they are too few to lend the book any credit. This is a poorly written story in every sense of the word. I gave it a single star rating because the central theme of humans being reduced to their basest traits in the absence of society's critical presence was an interesting one, and, also, the story had a few atmospheric passages."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Being that it is only about 90 pages long, I was able to finish this story in one afternoon. It is easy to see why Whites and Blacks get such different messages from the book.The reader is encouraged, throughout the story, to be sympathetic to the White characters. Since most Whites, even in the 21st century, have yet to shed their racist garments, they will naturally emphathize with the plight of these poor White guys who, unfortunately, are \\"forced\\" to put up with the strangeness of this strange land in order to steal the resources from that land's inhabitants. After all, White guys are having to put up with similar trials even today in order to steal the resources from, yeah, that's right, the same country, the Congo. Oh, pity those poor French military advisors who are forced to go into the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" to keep the natives fighting each other, to make sure they don't turn on the real theives of their abundant mineral resources. The horror! The horror!By contrast, Conrad's treatment of his black characters is non-existent. They are soul-less beasts of burden. Conrad doesn't even bother to give them names. They are just referred to as niggers. When they are described as being beaten, or left alone to die, or forced to work on Marlow's ship for over a month with no food except rotten hippo meat (Marlow's only concern was that the smell of the rotted meat was annoying the White guys), Conrad writes of these incidents with no more sympathy than what you would expect from a description of an ant being stepped on by our poor embattled protagonist. Only a Black fool would not be offended by Conrad's work and Barak Obama is anything but that.To get some idea of just how bad Conrad's character development is, compare it to that of one of his contemporaries who actually had talent ... Mark Twain. It is a sign of Twain's genius that he could suck Whites in by using the word \\"nigger\\", but at the same time get them to see his black characters as human beings. His black characters had names, families, they could even feel love and pain. Just like White people. Imagine that."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I enjoyed the premise of this book, but I never figured out what the &quot;Harp&quot; in the title means.

I would have given it zero stars, but I guess one star is as low as you can go."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The two Joseph Conrad novellas \\"Heart Of Darkness\\" and \\"The Secret Sharer\\" make for an interesting juxtaposition in this Signet Classic edition, not only because they are great stories but because of their interesting dialogue on the nature of man.In \\"Heart Of Darkness,\\" we follow our narrator, Marlow, as he leads a boat up the Congo to bring back an ivory seller named Kurtz, seeing along the way example after example of how cruelly the colonial powers treat the native population. Worse follows when Marlow finally reaches Kurtz, discovering a former idealist turned pirate who simply kills what he can and takes what he wants until jungle fever claims him.Most people read \\"Heart Of Darkness\\" after seeing \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" the Francis Ford Coppola movie based on the tale. It's startling how many elements of Conrad's story made the final cut, including a crazy Russian in the book who raves about how Kurtz has \\"expanded his mind\\" in such a way that makes you wonder if Conrad somehow foresaw Dennis Hopper. The modern nature of Conrad's writing seemed to anticipate the cinema of today. \\"Heart of Darkness\\" was certainly a favorite of auteurs; Orson Welles thought of making it into a movie before deciding instead on \\"Citizen Kane.\\"\\"Heart Of Darkness's\\" arrival to the present day hasn't been all favorable. It's out of favor with many academics because of passages like this, about the native population:\\"It was unearthly, and the men were - No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it - the suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity - like yours - the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar.\\"Not pleasant reading for the 21st century, but keep in mind this is the narrator talking, not Conrad. Conrad is playing a subtle game with the reader, stoking notions of racial superiority as a means of illuminating the wanton viciousness of the white colonists, who advanced civilization has made crueler and coarser than the blacks they enslave. The first time you read \\"Heart of Darkness\\" you worry for Marlow traveling in the company of a group of man-eating grass beaters. The second time, you realize that those black tribesmen are the only cannibals in the book who control their appetite.No question Conrad was a supreme pessimist when it came to human nature, which is why \\"The Secret Sharer\\" is such a welcome contrast. The narrator here is a captain on a ship, very young and held in suspicion by his crew, who finds himself harboring a fugitive, wanted for murder on another vessel.The captain brings him to his cabin, where the two become joined in their act of secrecy, sweating out possible discovery from the captain's crew. In time, they become like two children having a whispered conversation after midnight during a sleepover, brothers almost. As the bond deepens, the captain notices a modest resemblance between them.Sure, there's the requisite ambiguity, but if \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is all about the dark side of human nature, and of course it is, \\"The Secret Sharer\\" in a quieter way presents us with Conrad's notion of what makes life worth living, the ability of people to look out for one another and serve as shoulders to lean upon. Plus it has ample examples of Conrad's sea writing, which is really quite good."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I would have given it a five, but the tremendous complexity of Conrad's writing mars somewhat the fantastic novel. The book is about a British sailor, Marlow, who ventures into the depth of the African continent - to Congo, which at the time (beginning of the 20th century) was colonized by the British. The deeper Marlow's steam-boat penetrates into the continent - the looser are the ties with the western civilization, until it seems to Marlow that the western civilization exists only in his mind. Marlow witnesses the unbelievable cruelty on behalf of the British towards the natives, and starts questioning whether humanity and all the ideals that we are brought upon are nothing but arbitrary abstracts. The black continent draws Marlow in deeper and deeper and engulfes him in the shroud of darkness, and as Marlow takes his boat further to the heart of the continent - he gets ever closer to the heart of darkness, where he encounters Kurtz - an employer in the company that trades ivory. Kurtz is an incredibly ambiguous character, and on a symbolic level he is the heart of darkness. Kurtz, who essentially becomes a king of a native tribe, is torn between Good and Evil. He is overwhelmed by compassion and understanding towards the natives, and the compulsion to rule by terror.Great book - if you can get through the dense stuff - read it!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm not going to review of Conrad's actual work. Too much ink has been spilled on that. I just want to give my thoughts on the free kindle edition.Since it's free, you can't argue with the price. However, you sort of get what you pay for. The chapters are not keyed, making navigation a tad more difficult. This lack is almost a non-issue, however, since the book is so short. The text also contains quite a few typos. Most damaging to the reading experience is the somewhat sloppy paragraphing.These issues are minor, though. Since this edition is free, one shouldn't expect a pristine text."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When Marlow begins his journey to find the mythical Kurtz in HEART OF DARKNESS, Joseph Conrad dares the reader to accompany Marlow on a voyage less into the physical jungles of darkest Africa and more into the mental labyrinth that human beings erect to protect themselves from the horrors that they themselves build. In this justly famous novella, Conrad depicts a pre-politically correct age when white men thought it only fair and inevitable that they plunder the riches of Africa all the while comforting themselves that they were uplifting the fallen state of a lowly people.Conrad uses a twin layer of narratives in order to achieve the needed objectivity that he felt required to place the reader at varying distances from the horror that Kurtz cried out at the end. The opening narrator is unnamed, possibly Conrad himself, who sets the stage by placing the reader at a safe distance from the evils which lay squarely ahead. Through this narrator we get a bird'e eyes view of the true narrator Marlow, who is depicted as somehow different from the four other men on the deck of the Nellie. This difference in physical attributes slowly increases to concomitant differences in perspective, attitude, and general authorial reliability. Marlow is a deeply flawed man who has the disadvantage of viewing the unfolding events from the prejudiced eyes of a white colonial civil servant who is sure that the blacks in Africa are little different from his preconceived notion of uncivilized cannibals. Further, Marlow makes numerous errors of judgment along the way, many of them seemingly insignificant, yet the totality of the reader's perspective is twisted through the equally twisted lens of an unreliable narrator. Conrad's purpose in melding the reader to a flawed narrator was to insure that the reader could never trust what he reads, thereby increasing his sense of unease in that the sense of safety that Marlow feels, first on the deck of the Nellie, and later in the jungle itself, is as flimsy as the signposts that guide Marlow toward his goal.The goal is Kurtz, a trader who set out to civilize the blacks into accepting a white version of civilization, but Marlow finds out that the reverse happened. The true horror that Kurtz sees is the horror that all would be conquerors find when they discover that the philosophy of racial supremacy which led them into conflict with a people whom they deemed unworthy is shown to be built on straw. Kurtz knows that the only difference between his brutal acts toward the natives and their own similar atrocities toward themselves is no difference at all. As corrupt as Kurtz must have been, in his closing cry of horror, he finds a small measure of redemption and closure. Marlow sees what Kurtz saw, knew what Kurtz did, and heard up close and personal Kurtz's swan song of pain, but Marlow learned nothing of lasting value. All he could think of was to maintain the image of the Kurtz that was: \\"I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to Kurtz once more.\\" The journey that Kurtz took was a horror only because he became what he sought. The journey that Marlow took became a horror only because he learned nothing from what he sought. As you and I read HEART OF DARKNESS, we must decide which journey has the more meaningful signposts."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The &quot;conquest of the earth,&quot; which is the exploitation of one people of color by another, &quot;is not a pretty thing when you look into it.&quot; These words, among the first spoken by Marlowe, prepare us for the actual experience of seeing into the &quot;truth of things,&quot; which for Marlowe and Kurtz will be &quot;the horror.&quot; But Conrad's fable is far more than an exposing of colonizing ways. Marlowe makes it clear that the real horror exists within the human soul and that failure to recognize and enunciate its existence is the difference between being saved or damned in a world whose bright shining lies continually lead us astray.In reading the story the first time, it's probably best to go for &quot;content,&quot; extracting as much plot and characterization as possible from Conrad's multi-layered, impressionistic narrative.

In this novel it can be seen that a large theme is self-control, and the Africans actually exhibit more of that than the Europeans.On the trip upriver Marlow enlists a crew of about 30 cannibals to do the boat's manual labor. In contrast to the idiotic pilgrims, Conrad portrays the cannibals with dignity. They grow increasingly hungry on board, especially after the pilgrims throw their provision of stinking hippo meat overboard and the manager refuses to stop to trade for food on shore. Marlow tries to imagine why they don't eat him and the pilgrim, and the only answer he can offer is the restraint he values so highly in civilized people: &quot;Restraint! I would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me&quot; (Chapter II). Marlow respects them: &quot;They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them.&quot; Work is one of Marlow's highest values, and the pilgrims, we know, are terrible workers. In fact, the pilgrims are always behaving on a level beneath what you would expect of civilized men, while the cannibals keep acting on a level above what you would expect of savages.Conrad's style is original, perplexing and filled with imagery and symbolism."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart Of Darkness Book ReviewJoseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is a novel based on him. The book is absolutely amazing. The story is being told of Marlow who travels up the River Congo into the heart of the African Continent, at the height of European colonialism. Throughout the journey Marlow suffers a profound transformation on his out look into human nature, taking him into the darkness. He holds views of African continents, describing the natives with contempt. His prejudices are not able to remain indifferent to the cruelty and horrors of colonization.Marlow becomes obsessed by his goal to meet Kurtz. Kurtz is a mystical character who has become famous for his success finding an enormous amount of ivory. Deep inside Marlow holds the hope that Kurtz will be able to give him a logical, justification for the horrors he has seen. When they meet, Marlow finds Kurtz has become a savage himself and has lost ties to any moral standard. He has plunged himself into insanity and horror. This book is a very suspenseful. I guarantee you that you will be on the edge of you seat reading this book. It is very deep, and can be interrupted in many different ways. So if you get a chance you should definitely read this book.~Chris"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"If I could give one piece of advice to those about to tackle Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; it would be to get a version with lots of background information, literary criticisms, and the like.The best way to read it is to read it once through (in my version, this was a short, but very dense 115 pages), then read all the extra stuff, then read it again. Unless you're a certified genius with extensive literary and historical knowledge, you're going to be lost without all the outside information.That said, this is a very affecting book. It's really all the ambiguities and the frustrating anticlimax that make you think.

I think young readers have trouble with long sentences, having been raised on TV and video games.Here's a sample: \\"The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist.

The captain meets an ivory trader with a magnetic personality (Kurtz). The story revolves around Kurtz and the corruption of the colonial system of exploiting Africa. The narrator returns to England to tell the story of his survival.This book hardly qualifies as a novel: my copy is only 72 pages long. I would think that students would like the short page count. Instead, they react to the slow-moving story and well-developed description and internal monologue.Here's a sample where the boat captain narrator describes Kurtz: \\"He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch dance in his honor; he could also fill the small souls of the piilgrims with bitter misgivings; he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking.\\"I found the story very interesting and the language truly exceptional."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The \\"conquest of the earth,\\" which is the exploitation of one people of color by another, \\"is not a pretty thing when you look into it.\\" These words, among the first spoken by Marlowe, prepare us for the actual experience of seeing into the \\"truth of things,\\" which for Marlowe and Kurtz will be \\"the horror.\\" But Conrad's fable is far more than an exposing of colonizing ways.

Why pay them and wait for them when it can be delivered quite conveniently at my doorstep?"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This certainly wasn't the worst book that I have ever read but I did not find it enjoyable. I did enjoy Conrad's eccentric use of verbatim but felt like he went overboard in some parts. Being wordy is ok as long as you don't go beyond the line of a reader's attention span.

I would only recommend this novella for those with long attention spans and can sift through vast expanses of words and come out with a general meaning."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"As I began reading this book, I felt a little disturbed. The use of details that Conrad uses in the story are incredible. As Marlow talks to his shipmates in the story, the details he uses are intense. As he talks of his trip up the river, his friends on the ship tend not to be paying attention to him. This contributes to the difficulty of reading this book. Conrad had Marlow telling his story, and at the same time he switches back and forth from that to Marlow talking to his friends in the present. This makes the story very confusing. Conrad successfully showed how the colonization and imperialism was selfish and the colonizers were only tried to make a profit by obtaining ivory. The story itself wasnt too bad. It had a good plot and I liked the ending. It wrapped up a little fast I thought, but overall it was a good ending. If you liked the movie, Apocollapse Now, you will definitely enjoy this book, since the movie is based on this book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Very pleased!

The narration of Marlow was unrealistic and dreadfully boring. Seriously: it's a seaman telling a story off the top of his mind, yet he incorporates extreme detail and excessive figurative language that just bogs you down. Oh, so detail is great, but how great is it if you have to analyze each individual word just to find some point in this nonsense. I think young students would benefit from the theme of this story (not that I found one), but the style of presenting it just makes you want to burn this book (not a bad idea, it's only $1.00! ). A very well written novel? Well, Conrad surely knows how to make a student's learning experience miserable. Five stars for boredom. One star for everything else."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The price on the book says 1.50... The text is too small and it may be better to pay a little more so you don't need a magnifying glass. Rip Off"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I read the book Heart of Darkness as a sophomore in high school and it was a very challenging book. The book is very hard to understand and you will learn how to read between the lines if you don't already. Joseph Conrad uses symbolism to show events and try to \\"spice\\" things up, but I could never grasp at those thoughts, unless someone pointed them out to me and then explained them to me. You should not read this book unless you love learning about history and events that lead to great movies or reading about someone telling you a story. Marlow is telling the readers a story throughout the book but he switches from him telling the story to dialogue between people, which can be confusing to keep up. Overall, I did not like this book. I would only recommend it to people who like history or people who usually like books that take an acquired taste. I would not recommend this book to my friends because some of them may feel smarter after they read it and some may feel like complete idiots because they were so confused while reading this highly valued book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I really wanted to like this book - honestly. I finished it this morning on the train while riding into work and after I was done I closed it, put it in my bag, and it was almost immediately gone from my conscience. I can't quite pinpoint what it is about the book that bothered me. How something so densely written can be so bland is beyond me. Conrad started to get my attention a few times, he really did. For instance, I was quite happy when the natives started shooting arrows at the boat. Not that I'm some simpleton that needs action and gore to be happy - that's not it at all. There was another reader that implied Conrad didn't speak his mind entirely - I think that's part of what bothered me. He'd start to to get to a point, and then lose it. I wanted to like this book because I love classics, but this did absolutely nothing for me.

The difficulty that many readers face when they pick up a classic, pre-twentieth century novel is that they are not conversant with the history of the times in which it was written. Heart of Darkness can be enjoyed purely as a well written novella, but then you miss so much of what Conrad is trying to say not only regarding the thin veneer of man's social persona (ala Lord of the Flies) but about the evils of 19th century imperialism. What is the story of Colonialism? Do Conrad's derogatory remarks about Blacks make him a bigot? What were Conrad's overall views on life? What were Conrad's personal experiences in the Congo? What did readers think of Heart of Darkness when it was written, and what do the critics think of it today?The Norton Critical Edition gives you 325 extra pages of material written by Conrad and others that provide answers to the above questions. You don't have to read all of these many articles, of course, but a good sampling of them will make your immersion in this famous story all the more enjoyable and meaningful.This is a story that everyone should read, and the Norton Critical Edition provides the best format for the reading experience."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was once one of those students forced to read this book at school. I was dragged kicking and screaming to its pages and read it only because I did not want to flunk my English Literature class. I was riveted from the first page, right up to the last paragraph. It is quite simply Conrad's finest book, (yes, I read his other books after this one.) However be aware, this is not everyone's cup of tea. There will be some people who will read this book and think, \\"Oh God, you have to be kidding!\\" However if you can get passed this mentality then you are in for a real literary treat.The story is simple enough, a young Englishman; Marlow (this character appears in Conrad's story \\"Youth\\") goes out to Africa to seek his fortune. He is at first idealistic, and full of himself. However he quickly realises that Africa is full of petty bureaucrats who have no idea how to make use of this dark jewel they have acquired. Like Colonists before them, they proceed to ravage and plunder the land of its natural resources. Enter Kurtz, an Ivory Trader who has gone Native. He has become a Renegade, living with his Black mistress in the heart of Africa's interior; systematically turning his back on his supposed civilised self.Marlow meets Kurtz after an eventful trip up the Congo and finds himself curiously attracted to this strange man who is [very ill], and obviously going insane. Kurtz in turn is an embarrassment to his employers who would rather see him dead than returned to \\"civilization.\\" Of course this is unspoken, and the hypocrisy of human natures sticks out like a sore thumb in this novel, especially as Kurtz is one of the best Ivory Traders on the Congo route.Marlow struggles to understand Kurtz and what makes him tick, but he only touches the surface of a man who can live in neither the Black or White world comfortably. He has been [harmed] by both worlds and therefore he is cursed. Heart of Darkness has many facets; it is a story about Imperialism, racism, and the darkness of human nature. Conrad purposely leaves the ending open to interpretation. ...This is a book that will make you think, make you want to it re-read again and again in case you have missed anything. There are also some genuinely funny moments in the book such as the Doctor who measures skulls for a hobby and the pompous Trading Post clerk who teaches his Black maid to starch his clothes. This edition, (Dover Thrift) is well worth getting as well, as it is [inexpensive] and cheerful and it definitely won't break the bank money wise."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"No-one seriously interested in English literature can afford not to read this book. As a central device, the parallel journey into the heart of Africa and the dark centre of the human experience, remains as powerful as ever. The writing in the opening pages, depicting the men and the Thames and the wide possibilities that rise with every outgoing tide, remain as evocative as anything in English. Conrad's subject is barbarity, a theme as relevant now as then. His dark view of the colonial instinct also stands as a warning at this very hour. With &quot;Lord Jim&quot; a thicker, but in many ways easier book to read, Conrad poses the great existential question that was to dominate personal politics throughout the 20th Century, the taking of personal responsibility, the search for personal redemption - as one character puts it: &quot;How to be - Ach! How to be?&quot; With &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; he articulates what Michael Ignatieff has described as &quot;the seductiveness of moral disgust.&quot; Faced with the darkness around him, the character Kurtz advises &quot;exterminate the brutes.&quot; His final, dread epiphany, his message from the heart of his own darkness &quot;The Horror! The Horror!&quot; is as chilling now as it was a century ago - a century that has seen more horror than even Conrad could have imagined."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Several people I am acquainted with have questioned my reading of &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; using as argument the fact that they read it &quot;in high school.&quot; Apparently, for these very well-read souls, if the book was in their high school reading list, then it should never be approached again. Well, both the poem of &quot;El Cid&quot; and the novel &quot;Don Quijote&quot; first revealed their wonders to me when I was in high school, and now that I have read them again (and &quot;Don Quijote&quot; complete this time), they have just proved to be timeless classics with something to tell a person of any age. &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; by Joseph Conrad, is a classic that, given its length, invites several readings, particularly if one goes beyond the &quot;high school-depth&quot; sadly evident in those acquaintances of mine. The different, dark, alien world of the Congo as barely seen through Marlow's eyes, juxtaposed with the author's subtle-but-powerful condemnation of a system that promotes exploitation of those seen as &quot;inferior,&quot; is one of this novella's most important, and often missed, commentaries. Marlow is the English sailor who does not, and cannot, understand anything that is not English, from the nameless city across the Channel (Brussels, most probably), to the ghost-like figures that people his employer's offices, to the multi-coloured map that shows how Africa has been carved, to the multi-coloured Russian whose language Marlowe cannot recognize and believes is cypher, to the river itself, to the native inhabitants of the land he is invading. This trip up the Congo river that Marlow tells his shipmates about while on the Thames is a journey after a man's voice, his treasure of ivory, and his report on the natives. This man, Kurtz, is the one who will state &quot;kill the brutes!&quot; in his report, expressing the opinion of so many Europeans regarding most, and maybe all, non-European races.&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; can be read simply as an adventure, but there are several, better, adventure books that have better &quot;hooks&quot; and are, at the same time, more easily forgotten. This is an extraordinary short book by an extraordinary author. Do not deprive yourself of a magnificent, early 20th century masterpiece of literature, just because someone was not hooked by it, or because someone read it in high school and it just wouldn't do to read it again. The power of this book is not in its &quot;easy&quot; prose, because its prose is definitely not easy. It is not in an artificially complex prose, either. This second fault seems more the refuge of other writers, plenty of them modern ones, who have confused &quot;good&quot; with obscure, and &quot;better&quot; with unreadable. Conrad knows how to tell a story, and there is a method to this dark tale told by Marlow, a man much closer to Kurtz than he would like to admit. Since the reader is presented only with Marlow's account, the jump from the reader to Marlow to Kurtz and back to the reader is a troubling one. Here is Conrad's mastery. Read the book. If you have read it, try it again. It may surprise you what new revelations prowl its pages.This 3rd Norton Critical edition is the best I have seen so far. The essays are all good, but Chinua Achebe's deserves special attention: the Nigerian author advocates not reading &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; at all, a statement that, coming from a writer, is not just surprising, but deeply disturbing. I sincerely believe that this form of intentional ignorance, of voluntary censorship on the part of the reader, only serves to foment a generalized, public ignorance of the world around us."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"There can be long debate about the hidden meanings, etc. in Heart of Darkness. And, of course, if one pays even a scintilla of attention. one's mind will no doubt be provoked by this deep, mysterious and moving tale. For example, there could be (I'm sure there has already been) a century long debate on the exact meaning of the title. However, besides the import of its moral/human/instinctive/spritual teachings, Heart of Darkness is often overlooked for the sheer excitement and anticipation the words cause. This is, to put it bluntly, a terriffic story. I was so anticipating the meeting between Marlow and Kurtz that I could barely stand it. And the visual imagery is astonishing. I will never forget the stakes with heads of savages. One must wonder how familiar Conrad was with the story of Vlad the Impaler (Dracula)!! Of course, it is the importance of the work that has made its immutable mark on literature. Any reader will surely be able to recognize his or her ! own instinctive/unconscious capabilities (desires, perhaps?) when they read this book. Who among us can wholly deny that we would not have behaved like Kurtz when left unrestrained by our society and placed in a position where it was not difficult to make a relatively unchallenged rise to power? Perhaps imperialism, left unchecked, is human nature, and our nature, our instinct is to civilize those different from us by way of any means feasible, which, with &quot;savages&quot; or the &quot;uncivilized&quot;, is violence, fear or terror. Do a quick check of history, and you will find this to be true. The Heart of Darkness may in fact be the heart of man, a metaphor for the instinctive nature of man."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"So help me, I tried. I really tried. Paragraph upon paragraph was read, re-read, and sometimes read a third time, trying to soak it all up. My efforts were often rewarded, but not necessarily with a mind-blowing epiphany or an intoxicatingly rich literary morsel. There were many times when I found myself asking if that was all there was to the stream of consciousness rambling, the scaffold of metaphors threatening to topple under their own weight, or the lofty word choices. Yes, there was insight. Yes there was truth. Yes there was a candid essay on imperialism, racism, and the consistently mentioned eponymous phrase that lingers in all of us. Is that all? How much am I missing? I found myself wishing I had Cliff's Notes or a critical edition just to see what others more experienced in deciphering this novella had to say. Alas, I had nothing but my own head and I came up short. Nothing in this story made me pause and wonder. Nothing in this story made me want to read it again. Nothing in this story helped me to understand why it is so widely regarded as a classic. One thing that did strike me, however, is the fact that it is regarded as a book to be read by young adults. Many of the reviewers were in high school when they read it. My God, how much harder would it be at that age? I'm freaking forty-six and have lived and learned a great deal and I found it hard to plow through. What sadistic bastard would assign this to a fifteen year old and expect anything but a lot of confusion and frustration?Maybe I am not mentally up to what Conrad offers. Like pearls before swine, the book's brilliance is wasted on me. I'm cool with that. If I couldn't get it after putting my best into it, then it is something I'll never get. There are too many books out there with the label of \\"classic\\" and I'll try my luck with them. If you are like me and wonder what the fuss was all about, here's a raised glass to us all. Oink oink."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was motivated to re-visit Conrad's early masterpiece by Sebald's Walk in Suffolk, which contains a bio chapter on Conrad with emphasis on his Congo experience, which was a traumatic one. Conrad had taken up the job of a skipper of a river steamboat, but he quit after a short time, in disgust with the colonial practices of the Belgians and their crude exploitation methods.Marlow is Conrad's alter ego here, a captain who tells his story to some other guests at a dinner party. The party takes place on a ship in the Thames estuary around the turn of the 19th century. An initial narrator gives us the frame of the five men coming together for a chat and a drink and dinner. Marlow then takes over and tells us 'one of his inconsequential stories', as the introducer expects with some sarcasm: how he got the Congo job and went there with curiosity. He is appalled from the start by the crude colonialist violence that he observes on the African West Coast and then in the Congo territory itself, and by the raw greed of the colonialists. Kurtz of course, the main protagonist of Marlow's tale, who has not much of a 'life' role to play in the story, stands for the fallen white man, the one whose character cracked and who gave in to temptations and demons, his personal ones and from the world around him. He had the reputation of being a superior specimen, a man with morality and efficiency. The 'heart of darkness' is an ambiguous place and title. It can mean the center of the unknown inner Africa, but it also means the soul of the fallen man.(Kurtz is best known with the face of Marlon Brando and the whispered words: the horror! the horror! But Apocalypse Now transformed the story from Congo colonialism into Indochina war cruelty.)Marlow's attitude is ambiguous, he thinks like a benevolent white man with an essentially racist attitude himself, but with a more 'humane' approach. He is realistic about imperialism: the conquest of the earth means mostly the taking it away from those who have a different complexion and flatter noses. He even takes history with a broader sweep: looking over the Thames at sunset towards the 'monster' city he is reminded of the times when this was a dark place for the invading Roman army.The book is written in a remarkably opaque language. One struggles with every single sentence just to follow the story line. This is unfortunate, I am sure a more straightforward narrative technique would have opened a broader audience for the subject.Conrad was a man who produced stunning visual effects of the mind with his inventions, but he was not a chief engineer of narrative simplicity. If one is looking for a good straightforward narrative, this is not it. If one is willing to take up the struggle, one is rewarded though. One has to wrestle meaning out of his writing, it is not a walk in the park. The style is highly contextual, every sentence implies worlds and assumes you know which ones. At the same time, he is also able to come up with pretty gems of sentences like when Marlow describes his steamboat: she rang under my feet like an empty biscuit tin, but she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape.In line with the frame narrator's low expectations for Marlow's story, half of the audience is asleep by half way. I was not."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"So much has been written about 'Heart of Darkness' that it is hard to contribute to the discussion without immediately becoming redundant. But here is one point: part of the beauty of this masterpieces is that it - like all great works of art - functions on many levels. You can look at it as a criticism of Imperialism, as many have, although nowadays this traditional viewpoint seems stale. You may enjoy it for its masterful use of the English language; in fact, I can think of no better 'classical' tale form except perhaps that of Moby Dick. You may be startled by a short passage that strikes you as profound in its psychological richness. You can marvel at the strange character development where both Marlowe and Kurtz somehow remain elusive. And there is much more to ponder if you open your mind and simply allow the words to feed your imagination. Read it slowly, deliberately, and enjoy. It is doubtless one of the strangest works of English literature ever produced but perhaps also one of the best."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was once one of those students forced to read this book at school. I was dragged kicking and screaming to its pages and read it only because I did not want to flunk my class. I was riveted from the first page, right up to the last paragraph. It is quite simply Conrad's finest book, (yes, I read his other books after this one.) The story is simple enough, a young Englishman, Marlow goes out to Africa to seek his fortune. He is at first idealistic, and full of himself. However he quickly realises that Africa is full of petty bureaucrats who have no idea how to make use of this dark jewel they have acquired. Like Colonists before them, they proceed to ravage and plunder the land of its natural resources. Enter Kurtz, an Ivory Trader who has gone Native. He has become a Renegade, living with his Black mistress in the heart of Africa's interior; systematically turning his back on his supposed civilised self. Marlow meets him after an eventful trip up the Congo and finds himself curiously attracted to this strange man who is dying, and obviously going insane. Kurtz in turn is an embarrassment to his employers who would rather see him dead than returned to &quot;civilization.&quot; Of course this is unspoken, and the hypocrisy of human natures sticks out like a sore thumb in this novel, especially as Kurtz is one of the best Ivory Traders on the Congo route. Marlow struggles to understand Kurtz and what makes him tick, but he only touches the surface of a man who can live in neither the Black or White world comfortably. He has been corrupted by both worlds and therefore he is cursed. Heart of Darkness has many facets; it is a story about Imperialism, racism, and the darkness of human nature. Conrad purposely leaves the ending open to interpretation. What is the &quot;horror&quot; that Kurtz whispers with his dying breath, is it Africa herself with the depths that have yet to be uncovered, or is it the human psyche with all its viciousness as it greedily crushes a land and people into submission? This is a book that will make you think, make you want to it re-read again and again in case you have missed anything. There are also some genuinely funny moments in the book such as the Doctor who measures skulls for a hobby and the pompous Trading Post clerk who teaches his Black maid to starch his clothes. This edition, (Dover Thrift) is well worth getting as well, as it is cheap and cheerful and it definitely won't break the bank money wise."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Daytime scents of nightmare horrors. Man and his insane ways - bushman, postman, commoner, who to blame? Unless you are familiar with the background of this stunning novel do yourself a favor and get the Norton Critical Edition. For a century Conrad's novel has drawn raves and rage. Each is left to decide where the sanity line lies, to the right or to the left. Upriver or downriver? Riveting every page of the way."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Yes, why would I give five stars to a book that has given me a headache and almost put me to sleep both times I have read it? Am I mad? Do I have a terrible fever? Have I been eating rancid hippopotamus meat? No. It is because it is one of the seminal works on human nature written since the end of the 19th century. OK, so I realize that it is a bit presumptuous for a young person to make a claim like this, not having read every book that has been written since 1850 or so. But from the little I have read, I understand where it stands in literature. It stands at the crossroads of what Lionel Trilling called &quot;sincerity and authenticity.&quot; This book is clearly a turning point. All the Victorian novels I've read seem to conform to the idea that sincerity is that which actualizes the human spirit. A sort of Howard's End ingenuousness, if you will. Conrad, however, is all about authenticity. It is not in being truthful that Kurtz or any character in the book is able to realize any sort of immutable fact about existence, it is in being true to one's self. That is what makes Kurtz a &quot;great man.&quot; I am, in saying this, only scratching the surface of one of the main thematic channels in this novella. Conrad manages to say an incredible deal in so few pages. The void within or the mutability of the human psyche, the role and influence of society, and several other topics are explored to a surprising extent. If one can stand Conrad's rather repetitive narrator, Marlow, then there remains to be found one very dense and rewarding book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Many comment on the beauty of Conrad's prose. I do not find it here. Weighing in on the many reviews of this book, I confess at the outset that I often find Conrad's prose turgid and sometimes unbearable. Wading through this novella was a labor-- and not a labor of love. It is difficult to believe that the same author produced both this nightmarish harrangue and the compelling, &quot;An Outpost of Progress.&quot;Conrad's novella lives on primarily because it was the basis for Coppola's movie, _Apocalypse Now_. In fact, the movie is almost wholesale piracy of the novella. The painful irony is that Coppola muffed the ONE redeeming part of Conrad's work: the narrator's meeting with Kurtz's widow. I strongly suspect that these were scenes-- definitive scenes-- that wound up on the cutting room floor.In _The Heart of Darkness_ we do have these scenes, and they are the salvation of the novella. For those who return to civilization, the heart of darkness is always defined in the context of civilization, as jarring and fraudulent as that context may be."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This review is for the audio version of Heart of Darkness as read by David Case, not the novel itself.I had to read this book quickly over the weekend, and I thought listening to it as I read would speed up the process. While it did help me concentrate, I now regret listening to this version. The mood and atmosphere of this book requires something quite different than what is offered. Case's tone was, for lack of a better word, flippant. And almost high-pitched. I never felt the gloomy, eerie chill of Conrad's words because the reader's voice was so devoid of emotion. I think perhaps he was trying to convey Marlow's air of superiority...maybe attempting to portray Marlow as cold and cynical...I'm not sure. It didn't work for me. At times I thought he was reading the passages cold, with no actual understanding of what he was saying. Also, the other characters' voices all sounded exactly alike, and their accents were extremely muddled.I have since gone back and begun reading the book without listening along and I find it much more enjoyable--or maybe I should say, much creepier.The back of the CD case explains that Case has won numerous awards for all of his audio readings, and perhaps he is as good as his description. However, if you decide to buy an audio version of Heart of Darkness, I'd go with another one."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"One of the must reads in literature. Probably my favorite novel ever written. The short length is decieving. It is not a novel to be blown through without thought. The themes of this novel resonate more in our day and age than ever before. Literary greatness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Though not a good choice for the casual reader, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is a thought provoking, descriptive novel that not only delves deep into the jungles of Africa, but also deep into the jungle of the human psyche. Following the trail of a steamboat captain's adventures in Africa during the 19th century, Conrad's words seem to flow as he describes the various scenes and emotions throughout the book, but like a river, prolonged exposure can exhaust the reader, and sometimes the words can overwhelm and confuse more laid-back audiences.On a more positive note, Conrad touches on the many of the pivotal issues of his time and today. One of the more obvious ones is racism. Black native Africans are prominent in this book and they are portrayed as the beasts of burden and the blundering fools. Conrad goes further with this by discussing the issue of Slavery. Towards the beginning of his journey the main character encounters a mine where the blacks are being used as slaves, and the ones that are too weak to work anymore are piled in a corner of the mine to die.This leads to a discussion of Capitalism, another big issue in the book mostly personified by the incompetent overseers of the trading stations along the Congo River, on which the main character steams along. Overall the book has a very dark mood only lightened by the main character's occasional humorous quips.Heart of Darkness is a masterpiece at heart and an excellent read for older and more experienced readers, but more casual audiences should stay clear, as they, like myself, may lose themselves in Conrad's words. My recommendation for an easier book would be The Lord of the Flies by William Golding, who borrowed many ideas from Conrad."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm not sure how to feel about this book. While reading it, I really could not become absorbed by Conrad's dense prose, though, while occasionaly eloquent, is very thick, and, well, British. But now that I am finished with it, I can not get the images the novella invokes out of my head. The conquest of Africa by the Imperialist on the surface, and the corruption of man's very morality underneath. The story is deceptively simple, merely a man working for an Ivory trading company, ominously called \\"The Company\\", going up the Congo river to meet up with Kurtz, the archetype of Western Imperialism. During this trip, we are shown the inner workings of man and his heart of darkness. The novella is not perfect though. Conrad's condemnation of Imperialism is uneven. Yes, the only discernable cause of Kurtz's descent into evil and madness is the imperialist ethic of master-slave, and it is fairly clear that Marlowe (conrad) is condemning that ethic, but at the same time, he doesn't work very hard to elevate the view of the African natives any higher in the esteem of his western readers. Anyway, as the novella is only about 100 pages, it is something that can be read in a day. Invest an afternoon in it, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"After reading Barack Obama's autobiography, I felt I must read Heart of Darkness again to confirm my belief that Obama was wrong in his assessment of Conrad's novella and of Conrad himself. Obama says, \\"It is a racist book. The way Conrad sees it, Africa's the cesspool of the world, black folks are savages, and any contact with them breeds infections.\\"Most reviewers of Heart of Darkness consider Marlow to be the narrator. I say, read again, and study the words. The narrator of the novella is not Marlow. The narrator could be Conrad himself. The narrator begins by telling of himself and 3 mates in a friendly gathering aboard a ship - Marlow being one of the 4. The narrator makes no judgments of his own except to say that Marlow was \\"the only man of us who still 'followed the sea.'\\" And, \\"The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class.\\"The narrator quotes Marlow throughout the novella, and in that way Marlow becomes the narrator of his own story.Marlow's story is one of conflict within himself regarding the loyalty he must feel towards a man whom he knows to be evil: Kurtz, who conquers the minds of men, black and white, places admiration in the whites and fear in the blacks. Kurtz is the epitome of the hateful, negative, \\"superior\\" white. His only interest is in gaining fame and riches. Ivory, ivory. Plunder and raid. The natives of Africa are his tools. Kurtz's soul is \\"the heart of darkness.\\"Marlow tells the story of his voyage to meet and rescue Kurtz, a dying man. On board his ship, Marlow has a crew of blacks, whose hunger is not necessarily of his choosing: \\"Why in the name of all gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for us...amazes me...It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. It's easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition of one's soul than this kind of prolonged hunger.\\"Marlow explains away Kurtz's character even before he meets him: \\"Hadn't I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his being a gifted creature...the gift that stood out preeminently....was his ability to talk, his words - the gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness.\\"Marlow repeatedly speaks of the darkness of Kurtz's soul. \\"The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own...He had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land.\\" Kurtz, Marlow said, had sold his soul to the devil.In spite of this revulsion for Kurtz's \\"darkness,\\" Marlow remains loyal to him. Who can say that that is unnatural or unrealistic? A flaw, yes, but not unusual to acknowledge the evil, dark side of a man, yet pledge loyalty to him. Forget not the followers of Hitler, Saddam, and now Ahmadinejad! (I've heard justifications: \\"Hitler lied to us.\\")Marlow himself was not an evil soul. As for his racist statements and use of racist terminology, \\"savages\\" and the like, remember the story takes place in the 19thC at the latest. It would be a lie to deny that most whites then believed in a God-given superiority over all other races, particularly the blacks. And what we now consider \\"racist\\" words and appellations were then commonplace. Yes, meant to demean and \\"put them in their places.\\" But I would no more expect Conrad to sanitize those words, in relating this terrible story, than I would expect a WW2 historian to write about the hatred towards Japanese without using the words Japs, Nips, yellow bellies, slant-eyes, or the like. Hateful? Yes. Wrong? Yes. But that's the way it was.Heart of Darkness is, indeed, about racism and false sense of racial superiority. Conrad tells that story in the \\"darkest\\" way possible through the \\"heart of darkness\\" that lives within the darkest of souls. But to accuse Conrad of being a racist or to imply that the novella is racist, I think is wrong. To \\"write about\\" and \\"to be\\" are two different things.Obama says...\\"the book's not about Africa or black people. It's about the man who wrote it...I read the book to help me understand just what makes the white people so afraid.\\" Obama is only half right. He should read the book and analyze it in an objective light to understand that Conrad is talking about the evils of racism."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"So . . . I found a list of the top 100 books of the 20th century, and thought I should read some of them. This, of course, is the wrong reason to read something - because you think you ought to. I think we should read for enjoyment, or to learn something new, or gain a new perspective, etc. But it is probably some sort of intellectual vanity that drives us to read books that others have deemed worthy of being placed on a list such as \\"Top 100 of the 20th Century\\". Anyways, to the book (which was in the top 5) -This is a story within a story, as a sailor at the helm of a sailing ship recalls a story to his fellow shipmates, one of whom is relaying the story to us. I am not sure what has changed in literature, or how story telling has evolved (I am certainly no expert), but the prose feels . . . blurry. The descriptive feels vague and disjointed - maybe some of that was intentional - but I thought it was going to be a frightening journey into the dark recesses of the human psyche. It was not. To be fair, as a product of VHS and DVD, modern cinema, modern literature, my expectations are probably unrealistic, and I am probably not sophisticated enough to read this book in the proper context.If you are looking for a dark, disturbing narrative - this is not it. It is dated. Maybe it is an important book in the evolution of writing, but it is not enjoyable to read and offers nothing as compensation. I gave it 3/5 because I have read much worse - I am struggling though James Joyce's Usylsses, and I can safely say that that is the worst thing I have ever read, and it is rated #1 on the lists for top 100 of the 20th century - no idea why, its awful."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Everyone probably knows the plot basics of Heart of Darkness and that it inspired the scenario for the Vietnam-war movie Apocalypse Now - if with a significant degree of adaptation. The narrator, Marlow, an English seaman, tells the story of his journey up an unnamed river that can only be the Congo. At the end of the trip awaits him the famous and infamous Kurtz, both master and slave to the brutal trade that is taking place in the depths of an uncharted jungle. 'The horror! The horror!' will be Kurtz's parting words. For both victim and executioner, he has only been able to accept the terrible violence that European exploitation expects of its henchmen by becoming a local blood-cult figure, by bending to his will the forest's darkest, most secret primeval practices.The awesome strength of Heart of Darkness is in its simplicity. This is a short novella that does not dwell on or get lost in sub-plots. Marlow simply tells his story after the fact, as dusk settles on the Thames over the group of amateur sailors that is his audience. Joseph Conrad's purpose is likewise straightforward: to show us the conflict between the violent animal in man and rationality, and the impulse to do good. Fitting, moreover, with a contemporary art scene that was discovering African and island art, this upends conventional notions of civilization and humanity. The book's appeal is timeless, and it is a classic, told in deceptively straightforward yet effective terms.But Conrad's masterpiece, published in 1902, also is an invaluable testimony in the historical sense. Though country names are left out, it is clear that the story takes place in the Belgian Congo, then the territory of the secretive Congo Free State, actually a corporation in the ownership of the Belgian king. The only difference is that the colonial undertaking was killing and causing deaths on an epic scale in the search for natural rubber, whereas in Heart of Darkness it is ivory. Conrad, having long been a seaman, had great credibility. At the time of publication, the Congo Free State was trying to fend-off a campaign to expose its terrible crimes by the journalist E.D. Morel. Conrad was taking a courageous stand. His descriptions of the colonialists are not kind. And this is, in many places, is an openly anti-racist novel. The Congo Free State's appalling exploitation of the Congo has been described in Adam Hochschild's book Leopold's Ghost (1999). Though the numbers Hochschild advances for the number of Africans killed are contested, the methods and nature of the exploitation carried out in the Congo are not."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"First of all, I cannot imagine anyone, let alone four people as in this story, being able to listen to Marlow's telling of this adventure in one sitting without ever engaging in conversation. At the minimum, one would think that one of them would at least ask a question. If this seems an unfair criticism, I'll just say that I don't personally know anyone who could resist interrupting him. It's a compelling tale; then why no response from those hearing it? Without response, how could anyone go on and on as Marlow does? On this second question--after thinking about it--I've known a few people who could go \\"on and on\\" to the point where the listener falls into a glassy-eyed stupor, whose primary desire is to exit. But I remain convinced that most people would find a way to break up the windbag's speech.In the introduction of John O'Hara's 1953 Modern Library addition of Appointment in Samarra, he noted his discovery from Lardner that \\"if you wrote down speech as it is spoken truly, you produce true characters, and the opposite is also true; if your characters don't talk like people they aren't good characters.\\" Marlow does not talk like \\"people.\\" O'Hara also said that writing good dialog is \\"almost totally lacking in the British.\\" This book is a good example of not even attempting good dialog. (Conrad was actually Polish but learned English in his early 20's and became a British subject at age 29.)Some have said that this classic novella of an excursion up the Congo River needs to be read more than once to fully appreciate its true meanings--they're deeply embedded--very deep. Oh? Is that the reader's problem or the writer's fault? I realize that this is like the sophomoric criticism of studying Shakespeare--one has to understand the time and place the work was written. Okay...let me just say that I prefer reading good literature where people behave, think, and sound like people. Perhaps at my advanced age I've become conditioned to the crisp dialog of Elmore Leonard, and others like him, to fully appreciate Joseph Conrad.My annoyance at Conrad's style aside, this is a book worth reading. I am told when initially published, the critics did not at all see it as controversial. It condemned adventuring, the taking advantage of the opportunities presented by imperialism, or it was a sentimental reinforcement of Victorian values. Only later was it seen as a more profound study of moral confusion, doubt and the hypocrisy of imperialism. Men, not just Kurtz, behaved badly in Heart of Darkness. Some say it's the natural result when people operate outside any social or moral constraint, especially when greed and the desire for power have totally corrupted them.Heart of Darkness is quite an indictment of colonialism and European behavior in carrying it out. It's full of cruelties, casually referenced, and meaningless acts--such as the French ship shooting their big guns into the jungle, not knowing what, if anything, they were shooting at. It's full of symbolism (e.g. fog), mystery, unanswered questions, folly, and absurdity.I particularly liked the ending when Marlow visited Kurtz's naive intended. Instead of telling her, his true last words, \\"the horror, the horror,\\" Marlow told the prissy Victorian bride-to-be who \\"knew Kurtz best\\" as an admirable man, that her name was the last thing on his mind. This lie symbolizes all that is right with Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is not an easy read.

Excellent uses of symbols and motifs. I appreciate the value and importance of this book (probably 4 stars for this) and I definitely think everybody shoud read it , but I can't say I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Like most people, I was familiar with Heart of Darkness, both as an acclaimed work of literature and as the inspiration for the remarkable movie Apocolypse Now. For some reason, I recently decided to make an attempt at reading it, despite my concern that it was written at a level beyond my capacity to understand.Upon receipt of the volume from Amazon, I was initially under the impression that I had mistakenly ordered the Cliff's Notes version of the work. I had no idea that the book was essentially a short story, easily readable in 2-3 hours.Even more surprising, was the ease with which I was able to follow and understand the story, though admittedly written in a slightly dense prose. Perhaps this was due to having seen Apocolypse Now and being familiar with the broad outline of the story and having read other works of history on the Belgian Congo.In any event, it was a decent story, filled with some beautifully descriptive language and imagery. I must say, however, that I was not bowled over. Steamship Captain pilots a ragged boat up the Congo, accompanied by colonial agents and support staff (cannibals and other natives) in an attempt to relieve a long stranded station agent (Kurtz) who has \\"gone native\\" and become the insane source of worship for the local natives. If you've seen Apocolypse Now, you know the story, just replace the Mekong with the Congo.I go back to my first paragraph in which I related a concern over my ability to understand what is considered a classic work of literature. I fully understood it, but was perhaps not qualified to fully appreciate it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is a book that I would compare to accomplishing a hard to reach goal. While achieving the goal, there are moments where it seems you will never finish, just like this book seems to never end. The book is described in great detail with many fine points that sometimes seem excessive. I understand the author describes the characters so that the reader gets involved and has sympathy for the people in it, but sometimes the minute details are too lengthy and the original intent is lost in the never concluding pages. I feel that sometimes Joseph Conrad rambles on his thoughts and does not know when to move on with the plot of the story.Another reason I did not particularly enjoy Heart of Darkness is because it is loaded with downbeat emotions and events; I realize this is so the reader realizes the harshness of the Europeans upon Africans, but I did not take pleasure in the negative tone throughout the book. I like to read light hearted stories, but after completing the book, I was proud that I pushed my way through it.I learned a lot from the literary forms, writing style, and unusual plot that Joseph Conrad encompassed in Heart of Darkness. By reading the story in English class, I was able to grasp aspects of the book I would not have understood on my own. I have not only expanded my knowledge of the history of Africa, but I have also expanded my vocabulary and learned new writing styles as I predicted I would. I am glad that we are having the opportunity to read this novel. I respect Conrad and appreciate his talent as an author, but I personally do not care for his style.I recommend this book to other English teachers searching for a book to read with their high school English classes, advanced high school students, and those who enjoy reading dark literature."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book is one of the few classics of English literature that actually lives up to its reputation and has had the staying power to remain in the hearts and minds of moderns. It deserves to be read and re-read because it is full of &quot;pithy&quot; quotes and the story's pacing, sly asides, and &quot;starting at the ending&quot; style anticipates (oddly enough) screenplay writing.Especially through our &quot;dark lens&quot; of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, we can appreciate the tale for its timeless portrayal of the problematic existential geopolitical world we have inherited. Heart of Darkness takes us into the colonial realm where a guerilla war constantly smolders, where supply and demand do not match up...where you must put up with the scent of rotting hippo meat. An ivory thief who has &quot;gone native&quot; succumbs to tropical diseases and doesn't make it back to Belgium. There is metaphor here but also the literal journey of the white man into the bloody dark realm...a journey that may have begun in colonial Africa, but which repeated itself in Southeast Asia, and again in the Middle East.Some readers may think that this book contains lessons and morals, but I argue that it contains nothing of the sort, and reflects life exactly as we experience it, in all its strange contradictions and quirky coincidence. Heart of Darkness begins with ominous foreshadowing and ends with a strange white lie. The echo of the work persists for long years afterwards. Unlike Marlon Brando, one should take this particular assigned reading seriously."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Having read the other reviews written here, I expected \\"Heart of Darkness\\" to be primarily about Howard Kurtz and his surreal fiefdom located along the shore of the Congo River. But we only get to meet Kurtz toward the end of this book. In the rest of the novel the narrator, a sailor named Marlow, circles about the subject of Kurtz by talking with people who only talk about Kurtz or their efforts to reach him.This novel will be a shock to the modern reader who is not used to the anachronistic racial stereotypes and blunt language found in \\"Mark Twain\\", \\"Candide\\", or other. Conrad calls the blacks of Africa \\"savages\\" and describes their comings and goings as a \\"wriggling mass of black arms\\". In \\"Heart of Darkness\\" we also see the stereotypical native with a bone through his nose-it's just like Edgar Rice Burrows's \\"Tarzan\\".Conrad mentions the blacks with hostility and talks of them as if they could not be real people. But he backs away from this callousness and speaks admirably of the helmsman of the steamer. He says that the heretofore-ignorant sailor became a loyal trusted aid with a big heart. Maybe Conrad is saying something about the merits of colonialism here. Regarding physical beauty, Conrad is enamored with the vision of a black woman who is evidently Kurt'z mistress. In these two characters we see that Conrad has mixed feelings toward the blacks.Another reviewer wrote of the metaphors that fill so many sentences. Conrad also deploys a lot of symbolism. That Kurtz's aide de campe was dressed like a Harlequin reminded me of Picasso's many portraits of a boy dressed similarly dressed. And the phrase \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is used repeatedly throughout. I believe it's meaning varies from one instance to the next. Prima faie it just means the obvious: Kurt'z camp is located in the middle of previously unknown and hostile country, a void. The narrator Marlow himself mentions this when recalled looking wistfully over maps of the world with huge unknown holes drawn into them.Chinua Achebe, author of \\"Things Fall Apart\\", wrote in an essay on \\"Heart of Darkness\\" that Europeans have traditionally used Africa as a \\"foil\\" the comparison with which makes their own accomplishments seem grander. His novel is, of course, an attack on colonialism itself.\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is about a journey into the Belgian Colony of the Congo. As you might know, Congo was renamed \\"Zaire\\" by the dictator Robert Mugabe. The warlord Laurent Kabila deposed Mugaba and now presides over its war with neighboring Rhawanda.For an up-to-date travelogue of Africa I recommend Shrinivas Naipal's memoir of Africa \\"East to West\\". He mentions \\"Heart of Darkness\\" frequently. I believe he see his trip as the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" journey revisited 100 years later."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It's been a couple of weeks since I read Heart of Darkness and I have to say - it's made almost no impression on me. I don't think I've thought about it once since I finished the novel. And for a literary novel like this, that's a real problem. A novel like this should have gotten under my skin and into my head. I should be thinking about it, considering how I feel about it, and pondering what it's trying to say.But honestly, I've got nothing.Even fans of the novel will probably agree that despite the adventurous storyline (a late 18th century steam ship voyage down the Congo River into the deepest, darkest depths of Africa to rescue an ill Station Captain) - this is a remarkably dull novel. The problem, at least in part, is that Conrad loves his descriptive prose and fills pages and pages with descriptions of local fauna and so on. The story is told by an unnamed narrator who coveys a story told to him by another man and this manages to limit any real sense of immediacy to the story.I was patient with this novel though because I anticipated that when Marlow and Kurtz finally met face to face, I would be rewarded. Not with action, but with stimulating, thought-provoking conversation.Boy, was I disappointed. Conrad tells his readers, repeatedly, what a remarkable man Kurtz is and how his views of the world \`expand the mind' but provides little evidence of that on the page. I can't help but compare the novel to the film Apocalypse Now and the scenes between Kurtz and Captain Willard. I recall Kurtz asking \\"Are my methods unsound?\\" and Willard replying eerily, \\"I don't see any method at all, sir.\\" (Now that's good stuff). I also remember Kurtz relaying a mesmerizing story about a village where the soldiers had given inoculations to the children only to discover that the villagers later chopped off all the children's arms and stacked them together. (Powerful stuff). It was the kind of story that gets into your head and crawls under your skin and stays with you.Heart of Darkness offers nothing of the sort. It's themes regarding the savage nature of men and how civilization is just a thin faade are too familiar now and while exposing the ugly truth about colonization may have been controversial at the time, it's hardly a startling revelation today. The novel feels dated and the ground it treads has since been addressed much more eloquently (Lord of the Flies comes immediately to mind).It occurs to me that Conrad wants the reader to sympathize with Kurtz in a way that I couldn't understand. He seems to be suggesting that Kurtz represents the opposite of what the Company men represent (weasel-like corporate climbers concerned with the trappings of civilization) while he represents something more noble because it is real and honest and visceral. The problem I found with this point of view is that both extremes are equally deplorable. I had no sympathy for Kurtz and felt no affinity for the Company men. It seemed to me that Conrad was offering only these extremes as if no other alternative existed, when clearly there are many shades of grey in the world.Ultimately I found Kurtz's message to be strangely incoherent and contradictory. For a man who was not afraid to judge, his view of the world was oddly ambiguous. I'm not opposed to ambiguity and like it when an author leaves his work open to interpretation but unfortunately I did not find Kurtz's views especially compelling and as a result I don't care much what his ambiguous dying message \\"The horror, the horror\\" really means. I have an interpretation of course, but I'm not losing sleep searching for new or deeper meaning in the words.I wanted to like this novel more than I did, but sadly it fell short of expectations. Is it one of the best novels of the 20th Century? Not even close. On a positive note, it did inspire one of the best films of the 20th Century. My advice: skip the novel and rent Apocalypse Now (the original, not the redux version)."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I can only thank God this novel was short. Reading it was a grueling process, not because of syntax errors or pretentious wording, but because it was so dull and dry. It seemed to drone on and on in the same monotone voice with no defined direction. I would not read this book for enjoyment, if you are to read it, do it because for some reason it is a classic and there are numerous allusions to the book in popular culture and modern literature. To pick the &quot;best&quot; part of the book, Conrad did do a good job on the themes of the unknown and the dark depths of human nature. The end was interesting, but it did not plunge me into an analysis of the book or any sort of emotional connection to my life."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Some people say that because this was and old book that we must forgive the way it was written.

In fact, I hated it. But I was reading it for class, and so I finished it. It was ponderous.All in all, this, to me at least, is not a book you read for enjoyment. It is something you read because someone tells you that you have to.Despite the lack of fun-ness, however, I can recognize geniuses of style. And Conrad is. The book a wonder of controlled words. There isn't a wasted one in the bunch. The themes are still themes which have some bearing on human life today. It's thick with symbolism. If you're looking for a 'thick' read, this one will do you."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The Secret Sharer isn't worth reading. The story starts off talking about the scenery which the author describes for way too long. The story ending does not really end the story. This story is dull and unexciting.

The whole story is worth the time."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I think Heart of Darkness is a well developed novel. It's Congo River setting adds to the hardships that Marlow and his crew go through. Conrad's details to the characters and the setting give you a frim imagination of where they are, what they look like, and the activities they are going through.However, the book is told in frame tale or a story inside a story which makes this novel a little hard to read.I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes an adventure story.

We see that his operation has the highest ivory yield in the entire trade. We come to admire him and become intriqued by the stories we hear.It is only at the end of the story that we see how Kurtz became an idol to the natives.

Maybe it's cause this book was written 100 years ago."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Even all the Heart of Darkness adulators must admit:(1) It is a difficult work, and hard even for an intelligent reader to follow. Marlow doesn't give a straightforward narrative - he digresses, he ruminates, he opines, he jumps around in time and space, he omits things (e.g., how does the boat suddenly get fixed at Central Station?). Uncommon patience is definitely demanded of the reader. (2) When Marlow finally does meet Kurtz, it's a letdown, at least the first time through. Kurtz's appearance in the story is limited to only a few pages. What we ultimately learn of him is mainly from what other people say about him. I realize that he's largely a symbol, but for a reader to anxiously anticipate a character for 70 pages and then hardly be allowed to get to know him directly is hard to accept."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I am glad to see others didn't care for this either.

I was able to get through it by force of will. This is one of those over-rated classics that were declared a classic a long time ago and now are blindly accepted as such. More than that, I see that many try to affirm it's alleged greatness by saying &quot;me too&quot; in clever ways. The story of a seaman who goes to Africa to command a riverboat deep in the jungle and encounters some horrors along the way is not particularly horrific or insightful. Many have marveled at Conrad's late-learned command of the English language. In fact his writing is unnecesarily dense. It is overloaded with adjectives and non-sequiturs that cloud his meaning and stray from the topic at hand. The best writing is clever, clear and to the point; it is not a string of adjectives and adverbs added to poorly conceived or uninteresting thoughts. The horrors described: an attack by natives and the sight of staked heads arranged in front of Kurtz's hut against a backdrop of squalid living conditions left me unimpressed. Europeans resorted to greater savageries against other races and among themselves both before and after the events in this novel. Unlike the many who were forced to read this in school, I decided to read it after twenty years of hearing that it was the inspiration for the Coppolla movie. That movie is one of the many examples of a good movie made from a flawed book."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I found this book very interesting to read. I also found it very frightening as it leads into trust and emotions. It enters both these areas quite deeply.I found it strange at first as I wasn't use to reading a book that contained so many quotes but I found this an interesting part of the book.The book leads to a lot of thinking as there are constantly images that Conrad describes loosely so your own mind thinks about them more.Having read this book, I watched Apocalypse Now and realised the large similarities that there are between the book and film.I also liked the book as it is a realtively short novel. If only all books were as gripping &amp; thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This is an interesting look at Africa. Conrad, based on his own experiences, describes Africa as an educated European would at the beginning of the century.Unfortunately, it tends to portray Africans as savages, but it also shows the follies of Europeans dealing with them as if they were savages. If this book were written in today's time, it would probably be considered racist. Fortunately, that was not the intent. It actually portrayed the Europeans as racists, elitists, and greedy. It's an evenhanded book in its portrayals, but both sides are not treated kindlyThe main point of this book is not a description of Africans, or Europeans, but of how the actually placement of one's self could affect someone's mind. All throughout the book, Marlowe, the main character, wishes to meet up with the legendary Kurtz. When he finally meets him, he discovers the insanity that a place like this could have on someone of such high stature as Kurtz. It's highly reminiscent of Apocalypse Now.Besides the unfortunate portrayal of Africans, the biggest grudge I have against this book is its language. It takes about 50 pages to get the feel of his writing, but this book is only 96 pages long.Though the language is rough, I would recommend this book. Conrad describes the jungle unlike any author I can think of."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm not sure how I really feel about this book.

Much too wordy for me but I appreciate the book"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I just don't care what the literary cannon with all it's chauvinism and ivy league name dropping has to say. I have read this book and I've been given all of these reasons why it's a classic and why it should be loved and cherished in the ranks of high literature forever. Because of all this propaganda, I have learned to appreciate this book but nothing, and I mean NOTHING has helped me to enjoy it. Let others praise and flatter his efforts. Never in my life have I found myself snoozing off uncontrollably while reading a book. The effect it had on me was the same I would get if I hadn't slept in 48 hours. I tried everything, from coffee to Red Bull and I couldn't manage without falling asleep every 5 or so pages.The fact that Marlowe is telling the story creates this sense of detachment between the reader and his experience that just drags the novel down. You can't just melt into the story. The writing is just so heavy handed. I felt like I was trudging through a swamp while I was reading this book. The sea imagery was the greatest snoozer of them all-who needs sleeping pills anymore? This guy just keeps stressing the point as if we don't get it already-no subtlety at all. I get it: we're going into the interior. I get it: the bleakness of human existence. I get it: who's civilized and who's the savage. I felt like he thought he was writing to a stupid audience or something. The messages he relays are worthwhile and his ambitions \\"noble\\", but the method is just hellish. He totally got the point across to me though. I mean, seriously, Get Me Out of This Nightmare!!!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I was a little disappointed in the Heart of Darkness. I think mostly because I was looking for a horror story, and this story definitely was not it.The story is supposed to be disturbing. I told Otty that I did not find the tale to be unsettling and he reminded me that I need to remember when it was written. I am usually good at putting myself in the context of when the story was written, which this one was written in the late 1800's. I think my problem with the story is that yes, the heart of darkness was a destination, but it was the people that made it so. The greed and desperation of man is what the heart of darkness truly contained. I believe I am unimpressed with this book because man has not changed in the last 100 years. Man is still just as greedy today and he was then, if not more so. Now, the deeds of men (the darkness of men) are normal practice. Maybe I am just terribly jaded.I did not find inspiration from Joseph Conrad's prose either. For the most part, I felt that his writing was somewhat flat and unimaginative. I did however; thoroughly enjoy what is called Conrad's \\"delayed decoding.\\" Ian Watt describes this as \\"the verbal equivalent of the impressionist painter's attempt to render visual sensation directly...present[ing] a sense impression and...withhold[ing] naming it or explaining its meaning until later.\\"Though I was not thrilled with the book, I am still glad that I read it. The Heart of Darkness is one of the classic literature pieces that being able to say you have read is always respectable."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Every story written by Conrad cries out for explication--and scores of academicians and other readers have enthusiastically obliged. Freudian interpretations, social interpretations, political interpretations, discussions of symbolism and of correspondences abound. The weight of paper devoted to these analyses far surpasses that of the original book, and I have long since ceased to be amused by those who purport to explain to us \\"what Conrad meant.\\" Yet, the very fact that so much has been written about Conrad's works is a fair indication that they carry messages for us, that they are worthily didactic as well as fascinating in their other aspects.Conrad himself was a remarkable man. A Ukrainian orphaned young when his parents died in czarist exile, Conrad found himself a sailor on a French merchantman by his 16th birthday. Four years later, we find him as a seaman aboard a British vessel hauling coal to Turkey, upon whose return we find him standing on British soil. He had grown up speaking Russian, Polish and French. Now he was to teach himself the English language. His phenomenal linguistic abilities coupled with his experiences as a salt-water sailor to produce a skillful author of quite unusual stories.He could have written fanciful adventures of sea-going sailors and swashbuckling adventurers, but there was more to Conrad's creative genius than a superficial teller of tales. He was able to see into the souls of men (and of himself), and he wove his stories to reveal the doubt, the sordidness, the fear, the greed, and sometimes the strength that he saw there. In \\"The Secret Sharer,\\" for example, he shows us the evolution of self doubt into courage and strength. In HEART OF DARKNESS, he shows us darker sides of men's souls: the fear, the avarice, the spiritual emptiness that reside there.Yes, HEART OF DARKNESS was inspired by Conrad's real travel into the 19th century Congo, and, yes, the story does contain a goodly measure of suspense and mystery, but the words tale the reader on a journey so much deeper than the superficial action alone. In fact, if one comes to the story expecting nothing more than an adventure, he may well leave disappointed, for the true value of this short novel lies in its innuendoes and suggestions of ideas and thoughts that transcend the action.Inasmuch as every reader filters an author's words through his own perceptions and interpretations, you may well come away from a reading of HEART OF DARKNESS with very different impressions than I, but that need not imply that either of us was \\"mistaken.\\" Rather, it is a measure of Conrad's greatness as a writer that he can speak meaningfully and thoughtfully to each of us, different as our experiences may have made us. For myself, I see not only the oft-noted condemnation of the social evils of imperialism but also a stringent criticism of capitalism itself, or rather of the spiritual emptiness experienced by a society that is focused on the accumulation of wealth.The novel is rich with symbols and implicit meanings, and I do not pretend that a single reading qualifies me even to discuss them. Yet, there is one that particularly haunts me. The woman in the jungle. She is, of course, the corresponding opposite of Kurtz's \\"Intended\\" back in civilized Europe, but who is she? Is she, perhaps, symbolic of an enfolding, absorbing maternalism that would have truly integrated Kurtz into the basic, raw, instinctual existence of the jungle had his fellow civilized Europeans not come to rescue him? But the jungle was killing Kurtz, so she is surely no protectress. Had Kurtz been assimilated, would he then have escaped the spiritual death of capitalistic Europe only to perish in the amoral culture of the jungle? But the \\"rescue\\" also fails to save him. Is there, then, no escape for man at all from spiritual desolation and death? Or does the no-escape message apply only to those who, like Kurtz, subvert lofty aspiration into base greed? I must read HEART OF DARKNESS again. Come along and read it with me; it's definitely worth your while."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"How I came to this book was my interest and fascination in Francis Ford Coppola's feature film Apocalypse Now. Apocalypse Now was based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.Heart of Darkness traces the journey of the central character Charles Marlow who takes employment as the captain of a ferry boat at the behest of his employer, a Belgian Trading Company, with instructions to transport ivory down the Congo river and, more significantly so, to bring Kurtz (a trading post commander and ivory trader) back.Without making comparisons between the feature film and the book, let's just say that upon reading Conrad, I fully understood the Kurtz character in the feature. Marlow, in the book, and at a station on the way up the river, is told by his employer's accountant that Kurtz is a \\"remarkable person\\".And therein develops Marlow's fascination with the man Kurtz and the subtle, yet extremely powerful, development of Kurtz the character in advance of Marlow's final meeting with him. Marlow is provided with snippets of information about Kurtz which reveal Kurtz more and to Marlow adding fuel to Marlow's benign interest in him. Saying Kurtz's reputation precedes him is an insult to the man. Kurtz has become a deity in the jungle.Implicit in the book is the issue of the colonisation by Europe of Africa and the plundering of Africa's resources. As you will no doubt know, King Leopold of Belgium raped and plundered the Congo for his own benefit which unfortunately has set in motion the future of the present day country, which still finds itself mired in corruption, genocide and exploitation of natural resources and it's people(pretty much the same as most African states which were former Eurpoean colonies).Conrad has been unfairly accused of being racist in his alleged depiction of native Africans in the book as savages. If anything, Conrad is sensitive to the plight of the indigenous people and their exploitation by their European masters.Marlow's final encounter with Kurtz at his jungle outpost and his personal meeting with the man is electric and will leave you with a permanent imprint of Kurtz in both the book and the feature film.Many reviews unfortunately give away the plot and in doing so spoil the piece of literature. I will not do that. My advice is this: watch the movie (the Redux version) with the volume up loud and absorb the the sights, sounds, texture and power that is Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Then take a few weeks off, allowing your mind to quietly ruminate over Coppola's masterpiece. Then read the book. Once you've read the book, Kurtz in both the feature and the book will make perfect sense to you."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The narrative of the trip down the Congo River by Charles Marlowe is filled with mystery, suspense, and subtlety. It is the late 1800s, and the narrator--Mr. Marlowe--is commissioned to sail deep down into Africa on a steamship to retrieve a Mr. Kurtz. Kurtz is spoken of as almost a demigod who forages for ivory amongst the tribes deep in the jungle.Mechanical failures and brutal native ambushes help to set the scene for the final horrible port of the ship--Kurtz's outpost. Kurtz has been living amongst the natives, using them for his savage exploits. The narrator himself is both appalled and softened by seeing this shell of a supposedly great man now turned into a monster.Conrad's message with this novella is a strong anti-colonial one. Most pieces of literature of the preceding couple centuries portrayed imperialism as a extended form of patriotism and manifest destiny for European states; it was a way of further expanding the supposed-greatness that already existed. Conrad turns that on its head by showing how well educated, civilized men full of deep-seeded moral rigor can quickly turn into abject monsters, as even the narrator is at times swayed with empathy for Kurtz.Matt Finizio[...]Box off. Life on."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad, as a young man, dreamed of visiting the Congo. He carried out this wish as a steamboat captain, chugging deep into the heart of that still mysterious land. We are told that his experiences became fodder for this, his best known work.\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is told primarily by a secondhand narrator. This seemed to be a favorite technique of writers in the late-1800s, though it creates a barrier between the fiction reader and the story itself. Perhaps that's a good thing, as we follow a captain's journey deeper into the jungle, further upriver. Along the way, we see disturbing glimpses of the racism and imperialism that was so predominant at the time. The English, Dutch, and Belgians were pillaging the Dark Continent for their own gain, looking down on the natives as uneducated savages. The captain is an impassive observer. He is a product of his time and social class. He is willing to work with the natives, to see them as equally human, but only in the most visceral sense.Does Conrad promote racism, then? I think he does the opposite. Even as his captain becomes clouded in thinking, deluded by the near-mythic existence of a man named Kurtz, he discovers his own nearness to that heart of darkness. He empathizes with eating human flesh, and other atrocities--only to find that Kurtz has plunged forever into his own narcissistic evil.In conclusion, Conrad seems to point fingers at any and all who would exalt themselves over other men and other races. If Kurtz is a microcosm of the gross imperialism of his age, then Conrad's criticisms are harsh, while also remaining immensely personal. Probably better understood in its day, and more jarring in contrast to other novels of its time, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is one of the first English novels to tackle the psychological aspects of evil in the heart of man. For that reason alone, it stands as an important literary work, even if it stumbles somewhat in its ability to entertain the modern reader."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The text of the story itself is truly fantastic, deeply psychological and probing. The Norton edition is great because it has some fantastic context, essays and other sources that really frame Conrad's work nicely. This is well worth it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I work in tech and haven't had time to read as much fiction as I would like. I feel that 'Heart of Darkness' is a masterpiece of the English language. I found myself re-reading many individual sentences multiple times just to appreciate the pure beauty of Conrad's construction and choice of words. (I've also earned a living as a non-fiction writer of training and ad copy.) There are writers that are a level above the others, Conrad is one of them. I said writer instead of author because this is indeed a wonderful example of the writer's craft, not simple authorship. Now, off to 'Secret Agent' and 'Lord Jim'."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"In writing this novella, Joseph Conrad did many things well in applying some of his experiences on the Congo in this work of fiction. Using a framed narrative allowed Conrad tell the story in a first person perspective outside of himself. While the framed narrative may lose some readers, this may be the best useage of the literary device I have ever read.It is hard to disagree with the stance that the Africans are portrayed as objects or sub-human in the text. Though flawed, it is a reflection of the thinking of that era. Europeans were exploiting Africa and its people. Though it is unsettling to some, the plot is centered on this historical event.The central figure Marlow has two objects as he follows the unnamed river in Africa. First, he is asked to smuggle ivory. However, his second and more pressing task is to return the man known as Mr. Kurtz to civilization. Kurtz has taken control of the natives in his collection of ivory while ascending to a status near that of a deity. The journey into darkness reveals more about man than about the geography of Africa.Like many readers, I had reckoned this to be among the standard bearers in English literature. My only disappointment was that I was waiting for something more to happen. Despite the plot being an \\"adventure\\", the action is sparse. The significance of this story is in the symbolism. If one can look past the objectification of Africans, he/she may genuinely enjoy this voyage into madness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Although English was not his initial language, I think that had it been, Conrad would have wielded much the same command of the language as Shakespeare in his day. But regardless of the writing quality, this is also a gripping and mesmerizing story. Perhaps some of this is because Conrad used to be in the same line of work as the main character, Marlow, who recurs in many of his works, but this story delves far beyond mere personal reflections, dealing with far more difficult and weighty issues than, say, Anna Karenina, and even many of the plays of Shakespeare; But, for me, the story is nevertheless as thrilling as any modern day mass-market novel, if not more because of its superior writing and philosophical quality. My favorite sections are Part 2, and the final scene, so don't give up early. I would give this six stars if I could."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I had trouble understanding the purpose and fanfare of Conrad's dual works until I realized he was making a political and social statement. With this in mind, Conrad writes a masterful work on the corruption of the human soul by the greed of colonization. This work is beneficial to English teachers as well as history teachers as it presents the darkness of greed in a relevant setting.The Secret Sharer on the other hand is less influential. I found it intriguing and well written, but not the triumph Heart of Darkness is. While this is based on a true story, it is less interesting than giants of today. The historical context makes this book valuable. When Conrad first wrote and published this work, it was on the cutting edge of literature, but today is would be considered boring."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I will not attempt to review it at length, so many here have done such a better job than I could.

As Marlow--a sea captain disgusted with the copious ignorance around him--recalls his experience of finding Kurtz--a brilliant prodigy turned mad by the wilderness--deep in the heart of Africa, Conrad presents dual plots in his story. The first plot, Marlow's search for Kurtz, wonderfully illustrates the surrender to madness in those around Marlow as they both travel further into the &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot; Likewise, the second plot--Kurtz's life--delves the reader into the ingenious and penetrating mind of a man changed forever by the wild. As a result, the life of Marlow, Kurtz, and every other character changes greatly. After reading this book, one might question the civility of both man and his maker..."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Known as Conrad's most enigmatic and haunting work, this 1902 psychological thriller continues to pluck strings deeply planted in the human heart. Story of a young Englishman Marlow's adventure up the Congo River, Conrad paints a surreal yet harshly concrete tale evolving around the disturbances of the spirit. Marlow narrates his encounter (mental and physical) with the unfathomable Kurtz, a half-English, half-French ivory trader in the heart of Dark Africa yet to be explored. Long before Kurtz even takes shape and dictates his own path, his life is sewn into the lush landscape and told by despairing pioneers who worship the very characteristics that drive Kurtz to madness-the ambition to crown Western colonialism with the last uncharted puzzle of humanity. His impenetrable nature, more so than Congo it seems, dazzles and puzzles the natives as well as the whites who attempt to gain a better sense of identity through supremacism. Kurtz's ability to exert control over men and rule spiritually without physical manipulation is revealed as Marlow's own troubled spirit fuses into Kurtz's whirlpool of obsession to conquer and glorify brutality of another sort. Thus as Marlow ventures upstream towards Kurtz's quarter, appalled and fascinated by Kurtz's ominous sense of balance in a world of cannibals. Again, men who come hoping to conquer and penetrate, find not virgin soul ready to be sown with Western seeds, but the ultimate unconquerable and impenetrable in their own frail heart too shielded from the naked truth of life. Here, in Congo, Kurtz loses sanity as he is forced to stoop when he is conquered and penetrated by the harshness of Africa and its beaming beastliness that also roars underneath his pale skin. Marlow, as the sole heir to Kurtz's memory as a \\"hero\\", returns with a tale of desperation and of hate. Desperation and hate not of one person, but of one race/one world whose conscience is forever scarred by what they cannot fathom-darkness within themselves.&quot;For me it crawled towards Kurtz-exclusively... deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This novel is a true masterpiece, because it is extremely concise and manipulates the reader like no other novel. Conrad writes in the most eloquent prose imaginable, making ever syllable count as if it were poetry. As a result, it is very short and easy to read. His descriptions are vivid to the point where it beings to make you sick, which is the point. The journey into darkness and the tone of the novel have a way of manipulating the reader. There is no other book that can own a heart the way this one can. It is bone-wrenching, and the sight of skulls on fenceposts aren't the only illusions that will have you holding your breath. Even if you hate it, you will appreciate it because the novel owns you while you are reading."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's book shows the corruption that can grow into and flow out of man's heart when placed within an environment devoid of external restaint and/or accountability, even if such a man initially goes to such an environment with high moral ideas of bringing good. As a missionary with ideas of going to Africa, this was a lesson I needed to see illustrated before me so as not to fall into the errors that man can make when placed in such an environment. Conrad brillinatly displays for his readers the need for not only internal restraint, but external restraint as well."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I just finished to read this book. It's amazing how Conrad shows the way to 'total comprehension' through such a symbolic text. Not everyone will be able to understand the content, buty the one who will, will always remember this book for the important lessons that taught in order to live a perfect and straight life, based on high ideals. Thank you, Conrad."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Firstly, I think those who have rated this book low are not quite understanding a couple of things. This is not a pop-culture book. It was not written for mere entertainment like books are now a days. (Don't get me wrong, I 'm not some high and mighty English person, I love pop books, In fact Steve King is one of my fave's) You have to keep in mind that this book was written in 1902, and to understand the book and what it's trying to convey, you have to understand waht was going on in Joseph Conrad's world at the time. Heart of Darkness is not rich in plot. It was written mostly for the purpose of analysis. A lot of things that the reader is supposed to take away are infered. You have to look beyond the surface and read into things that aren't there. There's a lot of thinking and analysis involved. This is why I would not recommend this book to anyone in high school or younger. At that young of an age people have too short of an attention span (I did too) to really take the time to understand what this novella is all about. This is defenitly a &quot;literary&quot; novel in all senses of the term!!!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Conrad's novella describes the scenery in more detail than it does the people. In Europe, the people are nothing more than stereotypes, but the closer you get to Kurtz, the more defined, human, flawed and individual they become. Ultimately, Marlow finds Kurtz a broken, dying man. He also finds that that heart of darkness is not in the center of Africa, but in the center of his own soul."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"This book is not only the Heart of Darkness by title but by influence it is also the \\"heart of noir.\\" The mood of the book and the language itself is dense and suffocating, creating an bleak atmosphere that would inspire many film noir movies of the 40s and 50s. (This is not even to mention Apocalypse Now many years later which is not-so-loosely based on this novel, but set in a different milieu.) Consider this book the grandaddy of noir if you will. The ending is as bleak as they come, and I don't think rivaled by any of its imitators.Also I only think it fair to mention *twice* just how dense the writing is in this book. Be prepared!It's a wonderful experience in a brooding sort of way if you can get through it though and learn to navigate the language like the narrator navigates the jungle.If you have to read it for class, then my condolences. Under the gun this wouldn't be that fun of a read I don't think."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Upon re-reading this book here, now, some fifty years into the future, I found it stunningly written and overwhelmingly informed of human darkness and mystic wonder. I've read your negative reviews of this masterwork, and, quite frankly, I'm rather peeved. I have no respect for \\"modern\\" schools and education, or so-called \\"sensitivity\\" or \\"sensibilities,\\" so, to save time here---because that's the name of the game at my age---I'll just say that it's not your fault if you didn't \\"get\\" this book (duh, dude, yo.) To read and visualize the poetry of something the way it's meant to be, such as Heart Of Drakness---a bridge of Drama between the conscious and unconscious, because all perceived living is drama, and because all thought is mythic---seems to be a skill not concomitant with local and current inclinations. Watching \\"teevee,\\" and/or other \\"moving pictures\\"--especially the thoughtless, mind-imprisoning garbage they serve up in this era, and I have seen many eras--just can not give mind and imagination needed space for visualization, which is how the attendee experiences the experience itself, and not just some other person's opinion or night mare. Do you \\"get\\" me, dude, smell what I'm cooking--not! (yech! who thinks this sewage Up?) If you don't \\"get\\" Heart Of Darkness now, you will later, but it might be too much later. Unplug anything electric, and read a book or something. You know who you are."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"When reviewing a book as well known as Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, there is little point in wasting time describing plot and characters. So much has already been written about this masterpiece that only a broad outline is needed. Heart Of Darkness is a tale told by a seaman to his fellow crew members while their ship is anchored in the Thames Estuary. Marlow, a veteran of the sea, relates the story of a job he once had when he was required to navigate a great river in Africa in a steamboat to find a man called Kurtz. He - and Kurtz were dealing with a company that traded in and out of Africa, darkest Africa, as it was then often called.As ever with great literature, it is not what happens that matters. How things develop and how they are related is always the key, and Marlow, whose voice delivers almost all of the book's narrative, is not afraid of expressing opinion or offering interpretation alongside events. So subtle is Joseph Conrad's character, however, that the reader never feels that ideas are being hurled from the text. Throughout we are invited to share Marlow's world and world view in the same way that those imagined listening seamen share his story. We are never cajoled or commanded. The writer never uses the character merely to pontificate.The darkness at the heart of the book is multi-faceted. Yes, obviously, it is the dark continent that Africa represents in the received values of the time that lies at the centre of the story. Yes, the darkness also represents the dark-skinned people who inhabited the place. One thing the modern reader must be prepared for is Conrad's use of language, especially terms that would not today be tolerated. But Conrad's language is already more than a century old, and sometimes things change.On the other hand, another heart of darkness for Conrad was clearly the exploitative relationships that fostered and perpetuated colonialism. At the time, such a position would have run contrary to received assumptions. It is interesting to note that this aspect of darkness at the heart is mentioned at the outset, before the story has migrated to Africa, while we are still within sight of the heart of the Empire. There is another darkness, also, at the heart of human relationships. Sometimes people need protecting from the truth, it seems. Sometimes a little lie preserves a myth whose destruction would not help anyone who accepts its truth.What makes Heart Of Darkness a masterpiece is that its messages manage to be both universal and timeless, despite its clear foundation at the nineteenth century. They go to the heart of how human beings interact, both as individuals and as groups. They examine motive, allegiance and self-interest. They epitomise our inter-dependence, the necessity to co-operate, but they also identify and describe an equally essential need to compete, to assert individualism, to survive, sometimes at another's expense.At the heart of the novel, also, is the very experience of story telling. It is not just what Marlow relates to his companions that maintains our and apparently their interest: it is also how he tells the tale and how he offers interpretation of his feelings. Like Marlow himself, we are wiser for having relived the experience. And just like the unnamed listener who ostensibly wrote down Marlow's story, we remain spellbound by every word of this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Heart of Darkness is a classic novel that was an almost direct assault on (English) trading company methods and the greater concept of Imperialism, itself. Conrad constructs his novel with many sets of 3, channeling the three parts of Dante's Inferno / The Divine Comedy, and tells it in a \\"chinese box\\" fashion, featuring a set of stories within stories. The novel begins on board the Nellie on the Thames River, with Marlow beginning to tell his own story to his mariner companions. With great attention to the sea, personification of the jungle, and the greater idea of human restraint corresponding to its environment, Marlow recounts his memories of traveling down the Congo River under a Belgian Trading Company and the examples of humanity he encounters there. His prime example is a figure named Kurtz, who, although intelligent, musically gifted, and persuasive, loses all of his restraint along with himself in the heart of the Africa, leaving a lasting image of him being, \\"hollow to the core.\\" Kurtz only realizes the evils and extreme wrongs that took place in Africa at the moment before his death, exclaiming, \\"The horror, the horror!\\" Was he (and/or Conrad) referring to Kurtz's own deeds, the Company's futility and exploitation, or the very subject of Imperialism itself? You can be the judge after reading this intriguing novel.The Kindle book is easy to use and saves your place, as well as allowing you to highlight, bookmark, and makes notes."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I'm not going to pretend I know this book cover to cover, inside and out, but I did have to read it for my high school English class and it was more interesting than most of the other books I've read.

However, this novel had several words that even I didn't know. One very nice thing about reading this novella (or any text) on Kindle is that it is so easy to see the definitions of words. All you have to do is put the cursor next to the word, and the definition pops up. If you want to see more about the origins of the word, just click and there it is.Heart of Darkness is a very complex work, and to really understand it well requires research.

The punctuation is quite terrible, and the sentence structure while mostly acurate, is poorly formatted. If you are someone with good reading comprehension you may be able to understand the wording and phrasing despite these flaws. Overall this is a pretty good text, and to able to get it free is a nice bonus."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The book is set in the late 19th century, as the Europeans were stepping up their pillage of Africa. Between 1890 and 1910 the operations of Belguim in the Congo may have caused the deaths of ten million Congolese. Conrad was far from being an anti-racist and anti-colonial militant but the whole situation revolted him as it did all decent people.Conrad's greatest gift is his ability to make the scenes he describes come alive for the reader. The description of the African physical scenery is really exceptional. The details of the story are told in concise fashion. Conrad imparts very well to the reader Marlowe's feelings of awe while present in what is to him a mysterious and fearsome land, Africa, as well as the less than stellar personal qualities of the white men trying to do business in Africa. I think the best writing in the book takes place during the last part of Marlowe's journey by steamer to visit Kurtz's outpost, including the episode of the attack on the steamer by some of the natives."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I have reread this book a number of times and once you learn more about yourself it becomes all the more relevant. I believe this is a must for all adults vs. school kids because we truly do not know ourselves until we are older and have more life experience.

Buy a boxful and give them out to strangers at this price."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"\\"Hip is the sophistication of the wise primitive in a giant jungle.\\" ~Norman MailerI set my mind to start reading regularly again about seven years ago. In that time, there have only been two books that I have started and not finished. I am a little obsessive about it. I keep reading books that I am just hating all the time. One of the books I stopped reading was Lord Jim by Conrad. I simply wasn't in the mood for his writing style at that time. I figured it was time to give it another shot.Conrad is a wordsmith and a poet. He is very descriptive, and you really have to pay attention to what you are reading(at least I do). It is very easy to read a paragraph and let your mind wander so that you don't know what you just read. I found myself reading aloud (which I never do) just to keep my mind on what I was reading. Poetry is always best read aloud anyway. I found myself really admiring his writing and wordplay. What's especially incredible is when you consider Conrad was born in Poland and English wasn't even his second language.The book is biographical and is based on Conrad's own voyage up the Congo river in the 1800s. Conrad's alter ego, Marlowe finds himself in the middle of the dark jungle in search of a man named Kurtz. There he discovers what happens when men are away from civilization and how dark their heart can truly be. The book is full of symbolism and I wish I could say I was adept at connecting all the dots but I wasn't. I was just enjoying what I was reading (at times admittedly a bit confused). Once I finished the book, I read the introduction by Joyce Carol Oates and appreciated the book even more.My favorite line of the book was: \\"One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse.\\" So true. I vow I will finish Lord Jim one day."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Briefly Heart of Darkness is a must read classic. Most everyone knows the plot which was the basis for the movie \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" What is the Heart of Darkness of the title? Is it mysterious Africa itself in the 1890's at the height of the Colonial period; the dehumanization of the African natives at the hands of Europeans in the pretext of \\"improving\\" them: or the depravity lying just below the surface of civilized men such as Kurtz, the cultured, most capable object of narrator Marlowe's voyage up the Congo River to its last post. This is a voyage that must be taken more than once by the reader to fully experience Conrad's sense of just what it feels like to experience this exotic, threatening, luxurious, mysterious and mostly surprising world.This is merely a workable edition. I chose it just because it was hardback and inexpensive. It contains no extras. No introduction, appendix, essays, etc. Just the text. Other editions contain additional stories by Conrad such as the Secret Sharer and or introductions which many readers may find helpful. This edition is fine if you just want the story and nothing else. By the way the cover art is atrocious."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"On page 3, the narrator (not Marlow) tells us that \\"Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine.\\"This story is not typical. Its meaning isn't inside the text; rather, the text requires its meaning to be explicated outside in the world of symbols and signs. I recently used this text in a expository writing class focused mainly on teaching what, and not how to write (what to write when confronted with your own lack of desire to write). Conrad's text needs to be fitted into 19th century philosophy and especially epistemology. For a great essay see: Decentering \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Perry Meisel. If you're not reading this text for a class (with a teacher versed in 19th century philosophy) or with the intent to look into the historical \\"narrative\\" that brings out the meaning of the text like a \\"glow brings out a haze\\", then don't bother.I read this book quicky in about six hours, then spent the next 7 days going through 10 pages a day. That method seemed to work but those 10 pages took nearly 2 hours to read carefully. The result is a story so filled with symbolism that even reading it as a denounciation of colonialism or mperialism seems shallow! Highly recommended for disciplined reading!"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Most of the lower rated reviews reflect the views of students, compelled to read the novel to pass a class who are proportionately resentful of it.

Get the edition with The Secret Sharer and minus all the tartuffe commentaries, ect. Great story, but no one ought to be compelled to read it."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"Joseph Conrad's book, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is the ideal choice for any high school student choosing a novel from their class reading list. Being under 200 pages in length this book works with a student's busy loaded schedule, attention span and most of all grabs their attention. Overlooking the blatant racism implemented by most colonial nations during the rush for imperialism this book is accurate to the effects and general events which transpired during this period. The outlook and comments towards the African people by their colonial oppressors is mild compared with other novels written in the early 1900's. With all the description of the surroundings and events in this book, it drags you into its pages and putting it down becomes a struggle.The amount of symbolism in this book is amazing and refers to all aspects of human life, greed, moral standings, duty and much more. Constant description and detail is the perfect tool to awaken the imagination and the creativity of the reader. Symbolism is dripping from every paragraph along with imagery concerning anything from the unknown, the overwhelming and clamping effect of the river, the dark abyss which represents the jungle, and the natives and their fierce and alien but intriguing actions. This novel, now over 100 years old, can safely be called a classic and an extremely interesting read for any age old enough to understand the effects of early imperialism."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"The fiction, and the non-fiction. The prose are not for the unexperienced reader. Part of this great story explains of the ills of colonialism at the turn of the century. It posits probably, an accurate account of what one may have seen on the ground and \\"up country\\" at that time. Conrad certainly opens the pages of man's baseness, his sordidness. I eagerly anticipate reading his other works."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"An excellent work on the role of the imperial European forces in the shaping of the political and economic spheres in Asia and Africa around the turning of the previous century. Since these forces have been instrumental in the determination of the present day attitudes toward western powers, they must be studied carefully help in overcoming the negative aspects of what has resulted."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"I wrote a review of this book after reading it once and gave it two stars. I now have read the book four times (for my literature class) and every time I read it it gets better and better. Conrad's prose is so rich that each rereading brings hitherto undiscovered points to the fore. So skillful is it that in the space of 100 pages it delivers a thorough examination of moral corruption, the nature of existence and the horrors of 'civilising' enterprises that existed in Africa circa 1900. I think I can honestly say that the first time you read this book you will not like it, since reading it for the first time is a mentally gymnastic and physically exhausting process.

Each time I re-read it, I got different takes on it. &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is a book that tells a story on many levels - it's a story of the folly of imperialism, it's an adventure yarn, it's an exploration of the pros and cons of Victorian society, and at its heart (so to speak!) it's really an examination of the archetypal Film Noir issue - how is a good man to resist temptation and keep to a moral code (and what code, and why?) in a world which does not adhere to that code, a world full of darkness."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"What would you be if there were no limits, in a place where you are condidered God.

He spins a tale of the adventure into the untamed african jungle to recover an ivory trader that has gone insane and become a god to the natives.This story is a direct view of how easily man can be turned from good to evil in the steamy, dark jungle. Kurtz (the trader) was once a respected man, and he has dipped into his primitive Id. Completely insane, he begins to convince his pursuer, Marlow, to become as he is, but he is gripped by disease before Marlow fades into the same delerium.If you have not read Heart of Darkness, or you were assigned to read it and go the booknotes or such, I reccomend you pick a copy up and truly experiance insanity and the grip of the devil upon those who travel in untamed lands."},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"It's true that this book is not for everyone, but at such a great price you might as well try it.

The story comes from the author's own experiences, and reveals a unique and compelling look at the African river and deep African interior. The main charcter 'Marlow' is employed by an ivory company to take command of a cargo boat stranded in the interior, and from there the adventure springs from around every treacherous bend of the river. He bears witness to man's inhumanity to man, as well as the harshness of the country itself.

I read it, I liked it. I found it to be the opposite of what many of you said; Gripping and containing a definite climax. It was disturbing, and I know that I will reread it one day. I don't understand how some of you can profess &quot;not to understand 1 single page&quot;. even if you don't grasp the whole meaning of the narrative, can't you at least understand what the people are doing? because Conrad isn't vague or ambiguous about that. anyway, I say read it. if you don't, you probably won't be sorry. but if you do, then you probably will think that it's a good thing that you did read it"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer","review":"While many of the reviewers have pointed out the dark personal and historical aspects of this wonderful novella, few have noticed that Conrad was amazingly prophetic as well. Written at the turn of the century, Conrad accurately predicted many of the barbarities of the 20th Century--an epoch that tore the mask of civility and progress off Western civilization.In addition to criticizing the brutality and hypocricy of imperialism, Conrad suggests the dangerous allure of it as well. Take a look at the character of the Russian (Kurtz's disciple) and you have a picture of the average German in Nazi Germany--a person so spellbound by the nobility of his &quot;master's&quot; words and ideas as to be blind to the horrendous reality that master creates.And Conrad addresses all these issues (including those mentioned by other reviewers) with incredible subtlety. Unlike a modern novel which would be replete with sex and violence, in Heart of Darkness the violence is off stage and further removed through the use of a narrator. He lets the reader's imagination fill in the blanks--a brilliant way to show the reader just how dark his or her soul is.One of the truly great books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Inside Time: Innovations in the Basic Concepts of Physics and Mathematics","review":"Ray's work is one of the most thoughtful and intelligent works on the topic of mathematics that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Big Love- First Season, Vol. 1","review":"This series is wonderful.

After this happens, Bond vows to take them down no matter what the cost. I can't say to much about the plot, but I will say this...someone from Bond's past comes back...and this was a shocker. By the end of the book, Bond comes up aganist the mastermind of the Union...a blind man who has unusual sight.Benson has a strong style of writing.

Wish they would make movies of some of Benson's Bond books."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson is becoming surer and surer of his writing abilities, and &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; is his best Bond novel yet. Sure, there are some lapses into cliche and deadwood here and there, but mostly this is a solid, powerhouse read for Fleming fans. While John Gardner, acclaimed author though he was, merely cashed his annual check from Fleming's estate, churning out uninspired, routine stories, Benson obviously cares about having inherited the mantle from our dear boy Ian. There are some nice twists -- Bond using a dead rat as a weapon, laser surgery being used as a weapon -- and a couple of surprise guests from Bond's past. One can quite clearly hear the old voice of Bond in this, and it is due to Benson's increasingly tough and entertaining writing."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Having just completed reading Never Dream Of Dying, I can honestly say that in my view it is Benson's best effort since he entered the realm of 007. I say this for a variety of reasons. First off, some parts of the story are reminiscent of my all time personal favorite, &quot;Thunderball&quot; and secondly, he resurrects some old familiar characters that needed revisiting. One old acquaintance in particular is reconciled. Thirdly, you will see a different side of 007 that aptly shows how carelessly vulnerable even the great James Bond can become when mortalized with an affair of the heart. This story successfully closes out the &quot;Union&quot; trilogy and teases the reader with a hook that will take us to the next adventure. In conclusion. I would very much like to see some type of screen adaptation to this storyline. To the Brocolli's...GO GET THIS ONE."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"James Bond returns in a novel that very much recalls the world of Ian Fleming. To begin with, the book completes the &quot;Union Trilogy&quot; whereas Bond discovers the identity of Le Gerant and works to deal the criminal organization a death blow. However, this story is much more personal and long time Fleming fans will note that it effectively recalls the flavor of the Ian Fleming novels LIVE AND LET DIE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. As one reviewer noted, while Benson does not write like Fleming, he is able to capture his world and the essence of the James Bond character. One of the major ties to Fleming is the return of French agent Rene Mathis and Bond's father-in-law Marc-Ange Draco. Both of these characters are handled well and greatly add to the story and the James Bond saga.Benson has also turned up the notch with the amount of pain and suffering inflicted on Bond and his allies by the villains, much as Fleming did in LIVE AND LET DIE.Benson has definitely done his homework regarding Fleming and keeps true to the series. However, casual Bond fans will find they are not left out as Benson's Bond has similarity with the cinematic 007. The careful reader and viewer of the films will be able to pick up subtle clues and ties to the Eon Productions film series and how Benson has neatly and seamlessly entwined both of these worlds together.Finally, Benson has crafted a Fleming style, Bondian love story, yet manages to give it an original twist.Overall an excellent effort from an author who seeks to keep the true Bond alive while injecting new elements to the saga."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"I enjoy Raymond Benson's Bond novels. I have gone on to say that &quot;Doubleshot&quot; wasn't that good, because it wasn't, but this one is truely well written. The one thing I like about Benson is that he has read if not studied the Fleming novels. Bringing back both Marc-Ange Draco and Rene Mathis was brilliant. And the twist at the end, I read this book in two days. Please write more books Benson!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"In Nice, James Bond and his friend Rene Mathis fail to persuade Commandant Malherbe to call off the police raid. James and Rene feel the movie studio has too many civilians in the area while Malherbe feels they might not have a better opportunity to stop the Union from peddling their terrorist activities to the highest bidder. Nothing goes right as the raid turns into a trap leaving many dead, including several civilians. Movie producer/director Les Essinger uses the media to extract an apology from the French government.Over the next few weeks, Bond fails to find any clues on the Union. Meanwhile Mathis vanishes, but is actually in Corsica tracking a blind man who he believes is Le Gerant, the head of the Union. Finally, Bond obtains a lead from a murdered prisoner known as a Union man. The deceased has a tattoo on his eye. That takes Bond to Paris where he meets Essinger's estranged wife actress Tylyn Mignonne. 007 expects that when he meets up with Mathis all hell will break loose, but he is unaware that his trysts with Tylyn spells dangerous from the Union because that is personal.The latest Fleming-lite is an enjoyable James Bond tale that fans of the super spy will find entertaining. The story line is fast-paced although the Mathis sub-plot has almost as much ink as the 007 trail. Le Gerant is the usual Bond foe and Tylyn provides the typical female distraction. M, Moneypenny, and Boothroy add the SIS feel that accompanies Bond. All in all, Raymond Benson's latest 007 thriller provides the works, as Bond remains Bond.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"After experimenting in his last two books, HIGH TIME TO KILL (with plot) and DOUBLESHOT (with character), Benson returns to the basics and writes what may be his BEST Bond novel to date. This novel is CLASSIC Bond, right down to the return of the Aston Martin DB5, a glamorous heroine, Mediterranean locals, and a sadistic mega-villain with an intriguing physical handicap (he's blind). It's certainly the most cinematic of all Benson's books. Benson's writing is straightforward and strong, his locations are EXPERTLY researched, and his characterization of Bond is spot-on. Some 007 purists balk at Benson's books (as they did John Gardner's...and any movie that doesn't star Sean Connery), but for me Benson is getting better each time out. ... I also like how Benson sprinkles hints of what's to come in the next book (007 goes to Japan?). Can't wait!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"I think Benson did a courageous job with this book. Some people criticized him for what he did with the characters of Marc-Ange Draco and Mathis. I say that the Bond Universe was his to make use of, JUST AS IN ANY FRANCHISE. What he did with Draco was dramatic and surprising. This is one of Benson's BEST Bond novels."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Benson is no Ian Fleming, but he is trying. His use of questions in tense situations is disconcerting, to wit: 007 is about to have his hiding place revealed and the author has Bond say: &quot;Can I escape?&quot; I'm paraphrasing here, but such techniques do not add to 007's professional image. Overall an OK rendition of the continuing Bond series...and I will definitely read the next one, as well."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Having just completed reading Never Dream Of Dying, I can honestly say that in my view it is Benson's best effort since he entered the realm of 007. I say this for a variety of reasons. First off, some parts of the story are reminiscent of my all time personal favorite, &quot;Thunderball&quot; and secondly, he resurrects some old familiar characters that needed revisiting. One old aquantance in particular is reconciled. Thirdly, you will see a different side of 007 that aptly shows how carelessly vulnerable even the great James Bond can become when mortalized with an affair of the heart. This story successfully closes out the &quot;Union&quot; trilogy and teases the reader with a hook that will take us to the next adventure. In conclusion. I would very much like to see some type of screen adaptation to this storyline. To the Brocolli's...GO GET THIS ONE."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson is ruining the James Bond series. Each novel has gotten consistently worse. In this novel, Benson ruins the relationship between Bond and Draco, in a twist that should only be in movies. Which brings me to the point that Benson writes his novels like a movie. Although highly imaginative, not traditional Bond fare. He also constantly refers back to old Bond novels, as if he can't think of his own words for particular pieces of a novel. If anyone is planning to buy this, I urge you not to and instead buy a novel by Fleming from a used bookstore."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"I read &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; in two short days. I couldn't put it down. More than the other &quot;continuation&quot; authors, Raymond Benson captures the spirit of Ian Fleming's James Bond. He doesn't write like Fleming, but somehow he nails Fleming's character. The plot here is a thrilling conclusion to the &quot;Union trilogy&quot; (which began in &quot;High Time to Kill and continued in &quot;Doubleshot&quot;) but you don't need to have read those two to enjoy this one. Le Gerant is a great villain, and &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; boasts some terrific locations in Cannes and Corsica. It would make a great film, if only EON Productions would wake up and pay attention."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"A Bond book, like the films, is a journey where you know the destination but you want to enjoy the ride. Having read other reviews I am a little surprised to find my views are in conflict with many of them. I love Bond films and have enjoyed most of the books to date, however, this one felt...wrong.Bond only makes intermittent appearences for the first third of the book and when he does, it does not feel like Bond. I mean, he falls in love at first sight for goodness sake! The way Draco appears from the past and how their relationship evolves was clumsy and not how we want to see a character from the past dealt with.Okay there is action and a few gadgets but the real test is that if it was not a 007 branded book and was just a thriller it would be rather run of the mill. We fans deserve a little better."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"&quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; is the best post Fleming Bond novel to come along in a long, long time. Concentrating on the South of France and Corsica, Benson takes Bond on a deadly hunt for Le Gerant, Head of the Union, who Bond has been pursuing for the last two books. Here, he is joined by old friend and ally Rene Mathis, last seen in Flemings' &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, and Marc-Ange Draco, Bond's Father-in-Law. Benson adds to the characters of both without taking anything away from the past characterizations. Benson draws you into the story bit by bit, while also setting up his next novel, to be set in Japan. There are moments of horror not found in other novels, and a rather graphic sex scene, but these do not subtract from the story. Sex, Sadism, and Snobbery - the ingredients of a good James Bond story are all here. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"\\"Never Dream of Dying\\" is probably one of the better Bond books out there. While nothing can quite match Flemings \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", Never Dream of Dying comes extremely close. Benson does not bombard you with useless knowledge of casino games and gagets that some authors do (ie: Tom Clancy). Instead, what Benson does with this book is keep you turning the pages with his seamless transitions between scenes. The villains are believable and their motive is as well. Benson also brings in a couple of names from the past. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of 007."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson loves James Bond. That has been true in every one of the books he has done to date. NEVER DREAM OF DYING is no exception and the characters, both old and new, are pure Ian Fleming. Let's hope Mr.Benson's license to thrill is renewed again and again."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Never Dream Of Dying concludes the three part Union series with a bang! It is quite possibly the best book by Raymond Benson, (except maybe High Time To Kill being better.) It's full of great action, Bond girls, over the top villias and a magnificent plot.The book begins with 007 engaging in a police raid of a suspected Union headquarters that ends up going terribly wrong and killing innocent people. M then gives Bond the assignment to find Le Gerant, the head of the Union. Bond questions a Union member called Yassassin, but he is killed before he can divulge and information he knows. Bond discovers that all the Union members have tattoos on the retinas of their eyes. Bond travels to Paris and meets the suspicious film maker, Leon Essinger and his distant wife and actress, Tylyn Mignonne. Bond finds out that Essinger also has one of the Union tattoos. Bond searches Essingers boat, when a large scale battle breaks out, with Bond appearing to be dead. Bond is alive and kidnapped where he meets a person he thought dead years ago. Marc-Ange Draco, head of the Union-Corse and father of Bond's dead wife, Tracy. Bond discovers that Le Gerant is actually Draco's son. Bond meets up with his old friend, Rene Mathis, who is now working on the case with him. He is captured with Mathis and brutally tortured, by having their retinas burned. Bond escapes in a fury and finds out that Essinger and the Union are planning to explode a bomb t the Cannes film festival, where his new movie is opening, this will kill many members of the British royal family who are at the festival. Bond arrives just in time and stops the bomb, he also discovers that Draco was behind the bombing as well, and Essinger is taken away. Bond rescues Mathis and finds out that Draco, who was once Bond's friend, wants him dead because he thinks Bond was responsible for the deaths of his wife and child, that were in the building of the police raid in the beginning of the story. Bond kills Draco and destroys the helicoptor that Le Gerant was escaping in. This concludes the Union organization and the Union series. One member remains however, Goro Yoshida, who was planning with the Union. Bond deals with him in the next book by Raymond Benson.Never Dream Of Dying is a magnificent Bond book!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"OK, maybe that was a bit strong. But I'm a novelist too, and I personally would hate my characters being mucked about with after I was dead. Mathis and Marc-Ange Draco weren't his characters to begin with, and now he's made it so that if anyone else ever writes Bond novels, they cannot be used (unless Mathis became a pity figure, which would be horrible and not at all useful to the writer or fun to the reader). Benson's crime group and its leader are poor retreads of Blofeld and SPECTRE, too. All I see in this book is a writer cobbling together Fleming's old ideas to make money."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"This latest Bond offering didn't capture my imagination like the other. This book completes the Union trilogy, but the Union mystique kind of just fizzles out. The Union and le Gerant seemed much less evil in this offering. Bond spends the book chasing after the Union, but in the previous books, we had more of a sense of his impending doom. The bad guys are all from previous books. The only original bad guy is more of a pawn of the union. Aside from the story, Benson is not a very good writer. Maybe it was more prevalent in this novel that in others, But Benson uses the passive voice in writing sentences. Instead of describing scenes, he tells us with the verb &quot;was&quot;. I know a lot of authors do this, but Benson does it so much that it sticks out and becomes destracting. A better writer would find a better way to describe things. Benson will never be a great writer, but as his worst effort, this book wasn't that bad."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson has defined himself as the legitimate heir to Flemming. The James Bond of NDD has the old steel and ethics of Her Majesty's agent and a ruthless killer. Benson is true to the hero of the seventies and gives him a new slant. The action is relentless and unpredictable. There's no way this book can be read slowly.The characters and action made for a great time. I was not particularly excited about the metaphysics in the storyline but the heroine was great. Also, the &quot;family&quot; death seemed somewhat out of place.An excellent addition to the Bond tradition, let's hope Benson's next entry will be soon!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson was responsible for the novelizations of two James Bond flicks, so it is not surprising that \\"Never Dream of Dying\\" too reads like a book version of a movie. Perhaps, that is why the book is quite readable and the action in it fairly fast-paced. Most fiction written these days is so boring that I have not read a full-length novel in 20 years. Therefore, I was quite pleased to be easily able to finish this book without throwing it away in disgust.However, it cannot be said that \\"Never Dream of Dying\\" is well-written. Raymond Benson is a somewhat sloppy writer and his mistakes - both factual and literary - have slipped past his editor at Hodder and Stoughton, who, I suppose, is even more careless than Benson.I raised my eyebrows when I read (on pages 238-239) that James Bond fires at the tail of a Porsche that is chasing him and puts several holes in its boot (trunk). The fact is that no Porsche car model has ever had a trunk in its tail! The trunk is in the front in all the rear-engined models and the few front-engined Porsche models ever made (924, 928, 944, 968) are fastbacks with no real trunk. Any way, Porsche stopped making front-engined cars in 1995. This book was published in 2001 and the undated action in it takes place well after 1995, according to the internal evidence in the book. It seems strange that Bond's pursuers belonging to a well-funded criminal organization would be driving a rather outdated automobile (if one grants that the 1995 Porsche 968 had a \\"trunk\\" in its tail) .When the Ian Fleming Foundation invited Benson to take over the authorship of the Bond novels, there were complaints about an American being asked to write these books. Apparently in response to that criticism, Benson tries to write like an Englishman. Most of the time, he uses British terms like \\"lift\\", \\"lorry\\" and \\"petrol\\", yet he gives away his American origins when he refers (see pages 208-209) to an Alsatian as a German Shepherd! At other places in the book, he further lapses into Americanisms like \\"truck\\" and \\"gas\\". Ian Fleming would have never done that.Vague writing crops up here and there in Benson's book. For example, on page 231, he writes \\"She ran through the channels with the remote and eventually turned it off\\". The reader is supposed to infer that \\"it\\" apparently refers to the television, not the remote. Benson's grammar is occasionally bad. He uses wrong prepositions as in \\"gangplanks from the [ship]\\" (page 166).If somewhat poor writing does not catch your attention, then this book is certainly for you."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"This is the first of these pastiches of the old James Bond series that I have read. I will confess that I read Fleming many years ago (I think I was in high school) and enjoyed some of the earlier John Gardner books, frankly, more than I enjoyed Fleming. Later I became annoyed with Gardner somewhat, though he did attempt to paper over some of the sillier scenes in the later movies filmed while he was doing the writing. Raymond Benson is the latest contestant in the continuing saga of someone trying to write a book continuing a character that someone else created.Benson's writing is only mediocre, but of course the plot is what's important. All of the typical elements of a James Bond novel are here: a criminal mastermind who's trying to do horrible things, a weaker sidekick who's been maneuvered into cooperating, a beautiful woman caught up in things who's unsuspecting, and of course exotic locales and sophisticated entertainments like fancy restaurants and gambling in Monte Carlo.Benson handles all of this reasonably well, though as I said the writing's only so-so. I enjoyed the book reasonably well, and would recommend it to someone looking for mindless beach entertainment or something to read on a plane while travelling somewhere."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"I think this was the Mother of the Benson Series, We see more of Bonds feelings and thoughts about family in love with the cold harded killer personalty that goes with James Bond i have read Gardner's License Renewed and Cold Fall, They were ok but lacked detail and vissualization. Benson is quite the oppsite he gives good detail and information while keeping it in a Screenplay like format that is easy to see. This is personal the best James bond novel i have ever read and i think it will be first on my book shelf, but if your a die hard fleming fan you might not like this one. It's hard for a another write to follow in the foot steps of another and keep it the same. raymond Benson is the closest to Fleming yet! his best work!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"This novel contains the classic sensuous Bond of old, portrayed in a very realistic and believable style. There are no deep philosophical issues here, just action and suspense in an easy fun read. As in the Bond movies there are the usual exotic settings, Benson is good at this and uses them to great effect. The villains are well done and the story is superb. The ending was excellent, particularly the last two paragraphs."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"007 finally comes face to face with Le G&eacute;rant, the blind criminal genius who heads The Union crime syndicate. The meeting does not disappoint. Raymond Benson's writing is stylish and assured. It seems that he has deliberately attempted to push back the boundaries of the conventional Bond novel - the sex scenes are more explicit than any of their predecessors, the torture scenes more graphic. In-jokes sit comfortably alongside brutal violence. Benson's Bond is ruthless and resourceful, which is just the way we like him. Nothing is sacrosanct, and there are plenty of thrills and a few surprises before the end. Highly recommended, but let me give you a word of warning - if you like rats then there is one scene that will probably upset you!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson's best yet and the best James Bond novel since \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\" If you read any of the other non-Fleming Bond novels and did not care for them, read this one-Benson has captured the Fleming spirit. Enjoyed it from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Never Dream of dying was wonderful(I know I sound like an old lady). I coulden't put it down. Even the boring parts kept me at the edge of my seat! Raymond Benson could write an awesome book if he was sleeping! I've read all of his james Bond books they are great too! So sign on and get them off amazon. If you like action, explosions and the old bond charm you'll love this. It's the best book!(aside from Batman the ultimate evil) Buy this book"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson has a great respect for, knowledge of, and facility with the original Ian Fleming books about James Bond. As a result, he is able to recreate the well-known formula in ways similar to Mr. Fleming while reflecting and refracting powerful connections to the earlier stories. A thoughtful tip of the hat comes to every one of Mr. Fleming's books at one point or another in the story. As such, the book at some level of a Fleming tribute as much as an action novel. Unfortunately, Mr. Benson lacks the hard edge fascination with the bizarre, the deviant, and evil-doers that gave readers an eye-opening experience in Mr. Fleming's books. All James Bond fans will love the story, but it's a kinder, gentler version.Bond is on the trail of a recent nemesis (of the last few books), Le Gerant (manager or managing director in French) who is head of the evil organization, the Union. They are for hire to the highest bidder and specialize in providing arms for terrorist purposes. The story opens before a raid on a rotting film production facility in southern France. The French authorities have intelligence that arms are being hidden inside. They plan to attack while shooting is going on in one of the adjacent sound stages. Commander Bond disagrees, but it's a French operation, and the attack takes place under Commandant Malherbe (creative name for someone whose leading a doomed operation -- Mr. Benson is good with names that way). It's a Union trap for the French, and soon the French attackers are being cut down. In the desperate struggle that follows, Bond's counterattack causes a fire that burns down the occupied sound stage, killing 19 and injuring many more. The fall-out from the attack leads to Bond's friend, Rene Mathis (From Russia with Love) being put on leave for two months. Disgusted, M. Mathis resigns to track Le Gerant on his own. Bond wants to continue the chase as well, and wins reprieves from M as he makes progress.The book's overriding theme is about seeing and blindness. The theme is explored in terms of visual acuity, identity, foretelling the future, and communication. In this element, Mr. Benson exceeds the master. Although Mr. Fleming also explored complex themes in many dimensions, Mr. Benson is better at it here than Mr. Fleming was at the height of his talents.One of the book's most interesting parts is the way that characters you haven't read about in decades are woven back into this tale. This connection gives the book a powerful way to continue your impressions from those wonderful stories. You will have one major surprise along the way when someone supposedly dead reappears.As in all Bond stories, this novel has much more action than character development. Yet, you will find a few new dimensions to 007 that will probably interest you. There is a graphic description of &quot;safe sex&quot; in one encounter here that feels very much like Fleming at his best.The action all occurs right on schedule, from the obligatory opening scene to the post-battle wind-up with the leading lady. Many of the scenes make good use of the local scenary, and I thought that the Corsican descriptions were especially fine.After you read the book, I suggest that you also think about how risk and reward should be evaluated in your life. When is it a good idea to plunge ahead, and when is temporary caution more appropriate.Dream of better days . . . and take action to secure them!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Personally, it was a very good book, one of Benson's best. There was a lot of action, and even when nothing appears to be happening, the book still keeps your attention. However, my only beef with the book is when James Bond has to kill someone that he considered &quot;family&quot; at the end. What was up with that? It was almost painful to read about the death of one of the most lovable characters in Bond history. Oh well, other that that it was a great read."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"After enjoying James Bond novels for the guilty pleasures they are, I finally have to put them to rest with Benson's latest \`novel'. I may pick up a Bond book one day, but it will not be a Benson.Ian Fleming's novels are finally back in print in the USA, and I would encourage everyone reviewing here to pick them up and read them all. Fleming was very good at what he did. Bond was a perfect character to go to the movies, and he has endured as a character well past the Cold War.Bond was resurrected for the page in the early 80s by spy novelist John Gardner, who churned out no less than 13 Bond novels in about 15 years. Some were good, some were awful. It became clear that Gardner was not very interested in the legacy or the character of Bond. His books seemed to be about a guy named Bond who was a secret agent.Raymond Benson, super James Bond fan and indeed president of a fan club, was given the mantle to write these books. Not a novelist, Benson did good research and came up with good stories to work Bond and UK interests in.Unfortunately, he is a bad writer. A non-writer. His books alternate between long descriptions of everything Benson learned on his fact-finding missions to the locales featured in the novel, and then he cuts over to action, bad dialogue, more description, and even went so far as to include some nauseating and embarrassing sex scenes. He cannot write a novel where all of these elements blend into a solid story with sharp plotting and clear characters.Benson is obsessed with Fleming's Bond. However, he is not obsessed with attempting to write prose that even approaches John Gardner, let alone Fleming. The results are incredibly disappointing and downright silly at times. I don't know how well these have been selling, but it seems like the literary franchise of Bond has been destroyed. While each new Bond films takes in more than the last, Bond books just keep getting more upsetting.I couldn't even finish this book. After resurrecting characters Fleming created and killed, Benson's plotting is very shoddy, skipping out on Bond for whole sections. The lack of anything approaching engaging prose made me put this, and Benson, down for good.I gave him a chance. I endured most of \`the Union' trilogy, which is a sad attempt to resurrect SPECTRE. It doesn't have to be this bad. Glidrose needs a pro writer who can up the stock of Bond books.Not recommended. Go and hunt down Fleming, who must be spinning several times in his grave.Goodbye, Mr. Benson."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"As with Raymond Benson's previous Bond books, I really tried to read this book but had to quit in disgust! Benson's refers to a MPL submachine gun in his book. Any body with any type of tactical background knows that he should have referred to an H&amp;K MPK! Very poor editing also. When Benson describes Bond wearing a sportcoat, that's all the detail we get. Fleming would tell us the tailor and the material. These things were important to Fleming and Bond and they are part of the allure of the orginal books. Ian Fleming cared about the things he wore, drove, ate, drank and made love to. Raymond Benson does not have the slightest clue about the finer things in life nor does he want to. He probably wears Florshiem shoes, a Casio watch and shops for clothing at Penny's and could care less about the rest. A terrible book along with his other Bond books. What a total waste of a charachter!"},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"IT STARTED WITH STOLLEN ARMS IN NICE WHERE A RAID TASK FORCE(GOOD GUYS) WITH BOND AND HIS FRENCH SPY BUDDY RENE MATHIS GOES ALL WRONG KILLING MANY INOSINT PEOPLE.

He's not John Gardner, either (thank goodness!). That said, I believe Benson has come the closest to Ian Fleming of all the post-Fleming writers in that he has truly captured the essence of Bond's character and the universe in which 007 operates. It is a fantasy spy world, not based in reality, just as Fleming's was, but like Bond's creator, Benson keeps the main character very human. Benson's Bond makes mistakes, shows fear, feels pain, and is melancholy much of the time. At the same time, Benson has brought in many elements of the Bond film series (I have read an interview with him that states that he and the Ian Fleming Estate agreed that this would be the approach to take). Therefore, Benson's Bond is a mixture of the cinematic and literary Bonds, and for me, this works splendidly. I have seen some fans object to this or that but it seems to me that these fans are not getting past personal expectations. Bond is many things to many people. Benson, a long time Bond scholar and author of the excellent &quot;James Bond Bedside Companion&quot; knows his stuff. He has nailed the Bond character. Some have complained about his writing style. Benson is no Fleming, as stated earlier, but his style is succinct and easy to read. His books flow quickly and are highly entertaining. &quot;ZERO MINUS TEN&quot;: Benson's first book has one of his best plots, but it suffers slightly from being a &quot;first novel.&quot; His writing is at its weakest here, but that said, ZMT is a wonderful Bond story. It is very Fleming-esque with its Hong Kong location, characters like Guy Thackeray and T. Y. Woo and Li Xu Nan, and its descriptions of food, mahjong, and Triads. When reading ZMT, one is immediately aware that this is a harder-edged and darker Bond than perhaps what we are used to. For a first effort, it is very, very good. &quot;THE FACTS OF DEATH&quot;: Benson's second book is more film-like, it feels like an EON Productions movie story. The plot is more &quot;fantastic&quot; in that it deals with a secret criminal organization called the Decada that is run by a crazy mastermind. The writing is improved,though, and in many ways this is a more entertaining book than ZMT. What is especially interesting is Benson's development of the &quot;M&quot; character and her relationship with Bond. &quot;HIGH TIME TO KILL&quot;: My personal favorite of the bunch. This is a classic Bond novel in every sense of the word. The first half is fairly predictable cinematic-Bond stuff, except for a very Fleming-esque opening and 2nd chapter golf match. The second half, however, shows Benson hitting his stride and finding his own voice with a truly original departure from what is expected. As Bond and companions climb one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas, the action becomes more like an &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;-type story. It's authentic spy-stuff amidst an environment that is cruel and harsh. This is a thrilling, un-put-downable book. &quot;DOUBLESHOT&quot;: Another departure from the norm, as Benson appears to be experimenting with the structure of a Bond novel with this one. The first chapter is the ending of the book told from the different perspectives of several characters. The rest of the story begins in the past and catches up to the ending, and by then we are hooked. In this story, Bond is not well, he is injured, he is not working at full capacity, and this is what is interesting. &quot;Doubleshot&quot; is the middle book of a loose trilogy (beginning with &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;) and it is darker and more introspective than the others. Some fans apparently didn't get it, but in many ways, this is Benson's most courageous book. &quot;NEVER DREAM OF DYING&quot;: Another great one, right up there with &quot;High Time to Kill,&quot; in terms of glueing a reader to the page. It's an excellent plot, tying up the trilogy that Benson began in HTTK. In this book, one can see the blending of the cinematic and literary Bonds more than in any other entry-- a lot of the action is very movie-like, while the storyline and characterizations are more like the Fleming novels. The moods and settings are the best that Benson has done, and the love interest is perhaps his strongest. The real stroke of brilliance in the book is what the author has done with the character of Bond's father in law. A very engaging book. My five-star review is based on Benson's series as a whole. Each book may not be a 5-star book on its own, but I don't think any of them are less than 4. Benson has put his mark on the Bond literary series. Fans who don't like him tend to focus on one or two aspects of what he does-- his writing style, his dependence on the cinematic elements, whatever... I feel that they're not seeing the forest for the trees. In my humble opinion, Raymond Benson has brought new life to the series and I hope he continues the books a long, long time."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Say what you will about Benson's novels, he always strives to bridge the literary links between Fleming's originals and his own Bond adventures. 007's latest outing brings Bond face to face with Le Gerant, the mysterious mastermind behind the Union -- the deadly crime cartel Bond has battled in the previous two novels.Bond meets up with an old ally, Frenchman Rene Mathis who first appeared in Casino Royale, the Bond book that spawned the series. But perhaps more notably, Bond is reacquainted with his father-in-law, Marc-Ange Draco (On Her Majesty's Secret Service.) One of Fleming's most colorful and memorable characters, Draco's life since the death of Tracy -- Bond's murdered wife -- remained a mystery to readers, and I'm sure many of us wondered what became of his relationship with Bond in the subsequent years. Benson takes an enormous chance re-introducing a character of this stature, but somehow pulls it off.Never Dream of Dying has Bond back as the dogged assassin, and thanks to Benson's decision to limit the plot to a few well exploited locales, we're given more than glimpse of the historical Corsica, and the lavish Cannes. Unlike the film makers, Fleming was always smart enough to realize that the setting was as much a part of his novels as any character. By the end of a Fleming novel, and now a Benson novel, we feel as though we've lived a bit of the locale instead of just gotten off the bus for a couple of snapshots.My strongest recommendation for Never Dream of Dying comes not for it's tight plot, but for Benson's characterization of Bond, himself. He seems wiser, more hardened and, as a whole, more complete as a character. Cheers to you, Raymond, for continuing to take the job seriously, and for working so hard to get it right."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Well, Benson is known for his Bondian scholarship, and it shows in this book as in all his others. When he first came to the franchise I was impressed by his little 'Fleming' touches - detailed gambling scenes, precisely named gadgets and so on - but after a few books I'm getting a bit bored with it all.I didn't think this was a bad book, just that it wasn't a great book either. Having hit on the Bond formula, Benson seems content to tread water, writing the same style (though thankfully not the same story) over and over again.Is it time for another author to take over the franchise? I think I'd like to see each new Bond book written by a different author, each bringing something of his or her own style to the series. But would that destroy that magical 'Bondness' that we all love? I just don't know."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson has done something that no other Bond author has done. He has taken the literary James Bond into the film business. This was a bold move for Benson, seeing as some of the hardcore Bond fans might not like the idea. However, this bold move deserves the highest praise. It not only provides for a new realm that Bond has never been to. It also makes NEVER DREAM OF DYING a great read.After a botched raid on a French film studio, James Bond is under pressure and having to deal with lots of red tape. However, an unusual breakthrough in the Union case puts Bond back to work. The mission will send him to France and Monaco where he will meet up with an assorted cast of characters. Some these characters are the lovely Tylnn Mingnonne, his long-time colleague Rene Mathis, and even his father-in-law Marc-Ange Draco. To add Draco in the storyline to close up gaps that Fleming left was another brave move on Benson's part. Yet, it worked out and was a pleasant and unpleasant part of the story. There are many elements to NEVER DREAM OF DYING which make it great. Buy the book to find out.Raymond Benson took a chance with this fine book. It was well worth it though in my opinion. Benson has remained true to the original Bond of days of old. Most people seem to dislike this. This is merely because they are so used to the action-filled films, that they cannot appreciate Bond for the way he was created. To see Benson keep true with the Bond of Fleming's day earns him praise not only for this great book, but for being a great, bold and innovative author. NEVER DREAM OF DYING is a great book for many reasons. Bond's first outting into the film world makes NEVER DREAM OF DYING a book that you should buy."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"In this new Bond adventure, Bond partners up with French Agent (I'm not sure) Mathis to take down the Union once and for all, an organization who stops at nothing just to make trouble, by taking down their blind, but dangerous boss, Le Gerant. This book, as I would say, is the sequel to Benson's books High Time To Kill and Doubleshot, and he's successfully ended this trilogy. From beginning to end, I couldn't stop reading this book. Benson may not write like Fleming or Gardner, but he writes an even better Bond. His books have more action and suspense. Although, this may be a little disappointing for Bond fans since the story is not as classic like Goldfinger and Dr. No, but anyone who likes something with action, love, and is in need for a book this summer should be looking into this book before they skip this. Overall, it's Benson at his best."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"007 again faces The Union with its enigmatic boss Le Gerant, only now we're close enough to know that he's a blind man who doesn't need a cane to move around--he can sense where he is and what's around him. We've learned in earlier books that The Union is a descendent of the old Union Corse from the \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" days. Plus, the Union Corse's old boss--Marc Ange Draco--is still alive. Another thing Marc Ange was--for a few hours he was Bond's father in law by virtue of Bond's all too brief marriage to his daughter Teresa \\"Tracy\\" DiVienzo. The post-Fleming Bonds have all suffered from a time warp paradox--Fleming's Bond was a British naval veteran of World War II, which would make him about 75 by \\"real time\\". Previous books by both New Bond authors have almost ignored events of the Fleming epoch as a way of dodging that paradox. But one point of amusement in this book is the way Bond has bought the auctioned-off \\"Goldfinger\\" car--only to wish it still had all the cool gadgets it did when it was still in Q's charge."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"Raymond Benson's latest Bond novel literally, has it all! &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; is a classic Bond novel in the tradition of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. The adversaries Bond faces, the evil UNION, are the best group of Bond villians since SPECTRE. And the head of the UNION, Le Gerant, is the most evil, ingenious, and ruthless Bond villian since Blofeld.While on the trail of Le Gerant, Bond meets beautiful movie star Tylyn Mignonne. James Bond has not had such a genuine romance since Tracy in OHMSS, and it is great to see Bond head-over-heels in love.You need not be a Bond fan to enjoy this novel. Any John Grisham or Tom Clancy fan will be thrilled by this book as well.And Bond film producers, if you are out there, this novel MUST be made into a film! It has all the classic elements of the early Bond films."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"As a long time 007 fan, I have just re-read all of Raymond Benson's Bond novels in the proper order and have some reflections on his entire series through &quot;Never Dream of Dying.&quot; First of all, Benson is not Ian Fleming and readers should get past that expectation before beginning. He's not John Gardner, either (thank goodness!). That said, I believe Benson has come the closest to Ian Fleming of all the post-Fleming writers in that he has truly captured the essence of Bond's character and the universe in which 007 operates. It is a fantasy spy world, not based in reality, just as Fleming's was, but like Bond's creator, Benson keeps the main character very human. Benson's Bond makes mistakes, shows fear, feels pain, and is melancholy much of the time. At the same time, Benson has brought in many elements of the Bond film series (I have read an interview with him that states that he and the Ian Fleming Estate agreed that this would be the approach to take). Therefore, Benson's Bond is a mixture of the cinematic and literary Bonds, and for me, this works splendidly. I have seen some fans object to this or that but it seems to me that these fans are not getting past personal expectations. Bond is many things to many people. Benson, a long time Bond scholar and author of the excellent &quot;James Bond Bedside Companion&quot; knows his stuff. He has nailed the Bond character. Some have complained about his writing style. Benson is no Fleming, as stated earlier, but his style is succinct and easy to read. His books flow quickly and are highly entertaining. &quot;ZERO MINUS TEN&quot;: Benson's first book has one of his best plots, but it suffers slightly from being a &quot;first novel.&quot; His writing is at its weakest here, but that said, ZMT is a wonderful Bond story. It is very Fleming-esque with its Hong Kong location, characters like Guy Thackeray and T. Y. Woo and Li Xu Nan, and its descriptions of food, mahjong, and Triads. When reading ZMT, one is immediately aware that this is a harder-edged and darker Bond than perhaps what we are used to. For a first effort, it is very, very good. &quot;THE FACTS OF DEATH&quot;: Benson's second book is more film-like, it feels like an EON Productions movie story. The plot is more &quot;fantastic&quot; in that it deals with a secret criminal organization called the Decada that is run by a crazy mastermind. The writing is improved, though, and in many ways this is a more entertaining book than ZMT. What is especially interesting is Benson's development of the &quot;M&quot; character and her relationship with Bond. &quot;HIGH TIME TO KILL&quot;: My personal favorite of the bunch. This is a classic Bond novel in every sense of the word. The first half is fairly predictable cinematic-Bond stuff, except for a very Fleming-esque opening and 2nd chapter golf match. The second half, however, shows Benson hitting his stride and finding his own voice with a truly original departure from what is expected. As Bond and companions climb one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas, the action becomes more like an &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;-type story. It's authentic spy-stuff amidst an environment that is cruel and harsh. This is a thrilling, un-put-downable book. &quot;DOUBLESHOT&quot;: Another departure from the norm, as Benson appears to be experimenting with the structure of a Bond novel with this one. The first chapter is the ending of the book told from the different perspectives of several characters. The rest of the story begins in the past and catches up to the ending, and by then we are hooked. In this story, Bond is not well, he is injured, he is not working at full capacity, and this is what is interesting. &quot;Doubleshot&quot; is the middle book of a loose trilogy (beginning with &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;) and it is darker and more introspective than the others. Some fans apparently didn't get it, but in many ways, this is Benson's most courageous book. &quot;NEVER DREAM OF DYING&quot;: Another great one, right up there with &quot;High Time to Kill,&quot; in terms of glueing a reader to the page. It's an excellent plot, tying up the trilogy that Benson began in HTTK. In this book, one can see the blending of the cinematic and literary Bonds more than in any other entry-- a lot of the action is very movie-like, while the storyline and characterizations are more like the Fleming novels. The moods and settings are the best that Benson has done, and the love interest is perhaps his strongest. The real stroke of brilliance in the book is what the author has done with the character of Bond's father in law. A very engaging book. My five-star review is based on Benson's series as a whole. Each book may not be a 5-star book on its own, but I don't think any of them are less than 4. Benson has put his mark on the Bond literary series. Fans who don't like him tend to focus on one or two aspects of what he does-- his writing style, his dependence on the cinematic elements, whatever... I feel that they're not seeing the forest for the trees. In my humble opinion, Raymond Benson has brought new life to the series and I hope he continues the books a long, long time."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"The final part of Benson's Union trilogy fails to build on the previous work, &quot;Doubleshot&quot; (2000), and is another weak effort from him. I think the real problem lies in the fact that Benson just hasn't taken into account that the character of James Bond has moved on considerably from Fleming's original creation, and in order to keep pace with the cinematic version the novels need to have more action and excitement than ever before. John Gardner recognised this but tried to remain true to the literary Bond, not always successfully I'll admitt !!!, but Benson just doesn't seem to appreciate this. As a result he tends to write these limp thrillers that lack the pace of the movies, indeed the average pre-credit sequence of one of the films contains more excitement and spectacle than almost this entire novel. Also Benson has a terrible tendacy to treat Bond like a moron, taking far too long for 007 to put the pieces together in a plot that the average reader will have figured out after the first couple of chapters. The emphasis here is that Bond is an &quot;intelligence&quot; agent, not some &quot;stupid policeman&quot; (* as quoted by Dr No in the film !!!) and should NEVER be portrayed as such. Finally this novel has some surprising similarities to John Gardner's somewhat weak effort &quot;Never Send Flowers&quot; (1993), in that both involve the film industry in some respect and both end with a plot to blow up royalty !!! Sorry to say but at the price of hardback novels now this kind of effort just isn't worth it, so my advice to anyone considering buying this novel, wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Never Dream of Dying","review":"As a suspense writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I have endless admiration for the James Bond series. It is the most successful suspense/thriller series of all time--if one doesn't count Homer's heroic epics which are still in print a few millennia after they were written--and the series is still going strong in Raymond Benson's capable hands. He was a Bond scholar before he began writing these new Bond novels, and he gets Ian Fleming's characters and attitudes correct. NEVER DREAM OF DYING has everything one has grown to expect from a James Bond book or film. There are super-villians, exotic locales, glamorous women, and a spectacular conclusion. Read it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"In Mexico to be a patriot is the first thing that you learn at school,so to read this book was a nice surprice because is really objetive with mexican history.

If you want to know the origins of the problems and promise that is modern Mexico, then this is the book to read. It is, at its heart, a scholarly work with a lot of information and good references. The author is sympathetic toward the people of Mexico, but also lets the reader know about their weaknesses and foibles. A country with great a great future if only it allows itself to have it, Mexico is important for we Notre Americos to know about."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"As a Californian, after reading this book I have a heartfelt appreciation of and gratitude to that most obnoxious of American presidents, James Polk. He was the guy who provoked the Mexican War that brought California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (sorta) into the United States of America.Without that war, history could have trapped the southwestern part of the country within the Mexican polity and we would have shared the truly woeful history of Mexico.One can gripe about American shortcomings but the cultural, moral, and political workings of Mexico clearly show the superiority of American values. This book tells the tale through historical events and processes. Call me \\"ethnocentric\\" but the results speak for themselves.I will confess that I had a hard time following some of the political machinations during the revolts, rebellions, and general disorders of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Doesn't matter - I get the picture of one screwed up country. Still, a good read and very engrossing most of the time.I came to this book after reading the author's book on the history of Texas \\"Lone Star\\". I preferred \\"Lone Star\\" and not just because of the happier ending."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"In the very first paragraph he comments that \\"...we do not know when or where the human race originated\\".....ummm, we have a pretty good idea, and with genetic research of populations, human migrations are being documented even more accurately.

How ridiculous that some dusty old historian is treating this book as his means of venting about so-called liberal ideas such as climate change...I was convinced that this book had to be extremely dated, but the last edition was printed in 1995! There is no excuse!"},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"This book is a good introduction to the history of Mexico and is generally pretty readable. It gives a good picture of the complex and difficult history of the country, particularly from the time of the conquest until the mid-twentieth century. I would recommend reading this book because you will learn a lot. However, his view of the treatment of indiginous peoples seems dated and quite unsympathetic. It seems that the author has a particular dislike for some unnamed leftist intellectuals who might sympathize or romaticize the country's indiginous past. He spends far too much time tediously attacking some anonymous group that might insist on the importance of Mexico's Pre-Columbian past as a bunch of foolish romantics. In fact, a major theme of this book is to dispell any myth of Mexico as a country with a real Pre-Columbian heritage. Whether this is true seems debatable. Likewise, he spends an awful lot of time apologizing and excusing actions taken by the various Mexican governments. Having said all that, I still think it's a good introduction to Mexican history. I just recommend that you read it with a critical eye."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"Heavy book but an easy read. I have been trying to understand Mexico and reading all I can. The better books have been Conquest by Thomas, Mexico by Krauze and LaCapita by Kandell. Fehrenbach surpasses them all by a factor of two. For a &quot;non-fiction&quot; reader it is a smooth read and chunked full of significant observations and facts that a &quot;Gringo&quot; needs to understand when dealing with Mexico. It is a must read for the business executive working in Mexico as well as the historian trying to understand Mexico's feelings towards the United States."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"Having traveled and lived in Mexico most of my life, I was constantly exposed to certain aspects of every day life that just didn't seem to fit with my Anglo raising. Even though I spent forty five years immersed in the Mexican Culture there were certain things I just didn't understand. T.R. Fehrenbach's Fire and Blood answered most of my life long questions.The book is a meticulously researched, chronological history of the country known as Mexico. The book gives a detailed account of why citizens of Mexico today think and act the way they do; their philosophy of life, their relationship with the Catholic Church and their attitude toward a centralized government. If you could choose one or two sentences from the book that explain one of the basic differences between the Hispanic Culture and that of the remainder of North America it is Fehrenbach's assertion that while the rest of North America was colonized by settlers and explorers, the men arriving in Mexico from Spain were \\"Conquistadors\\", conquerors. That difference is what makes Mexico the wonderful country it is today.This book should be mandatory reading for anyone considering a business venture, or currently involved in business or trade with in Mexico. The insight you will receive can not be learned in a life time of living and working in the country. The same can be said for anyone interested in living or traveling in the country. It will help relieve some of the Anglo's misunderstanding and frustrations as to why the citizens of Mexico don't \\"do it\\" like we do."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"I am taking a Mexican History class (in Spanish and in Mexico) and have been using Fehrenbach's book to check on details of events and names of major political actors--many he does not even mention. That may be justified given that FIRE AND BLOOD is an overview rather than an in-depth analysis. Still, I noticed some glaring errors in addition to what seem like unfounded ethnocentric opinions. For example, the author claims that the Maya were living in the jungle as \\"savages\\" in the seventeenth century. He notes that \\"their written history carved on stone, is not readable\\" but does not mention the burning of the codices by Diego de Landa until 200 pages farther on in the book. Moreover, the author contends that the \\"Maya civilization destroyed itself without outside help,\\" referring to squabbling between the cities that were left after the civilization had \\"degenerated.\\" Mexico in the years following Independence is depicted as a society in which virtually no one had any idea of what it meant to be Mexican or how to build a nation or what the purpose of an election was. Finally, the comparisons between the United States (egalitarian, with democratic values even during colonial times) and Mexico (essentially the opposite) is a misleading oversimplification. And George Washington was not selected by Congress but by the Electoral College in the first presidential election. A book without a single footnote and only the briefest list of references, many of which are from the early twentieth century, cannot, in my view, be characterized as scholarly."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"A tiresome read; however, the scope was irresistable. On the political spectrum, non-dogmatically right-wing. Biggest annoyance: constantly makes oblique references to uncited sources (&quot;it has often been said that... however...&quot;). Occasional factual inaccuracies, and bizarrely unfounded opinions. For anyone interested in the current situation in Chiapas or the place of the Mayan peoples in Mexico's history, it's almost useless - the author has no interest in these issues and thus almost ignores them (he dismisses the entire Mayan culture as essentially no more than derivative of the Aztec). It's a useful book as a supplement to other, more specialized books (e.g. Hugh Thomas's excellent Conquest of Mexico). I felt I got an extensive overview, from the earliest nomadic peoples to Cortes to Zedillo, but not one upon which I could really depend factually."},{"Title":"Fire and Blood","review":"This book is a wonderful read especially for anyone who lives or has grown up close to the Mexican border.

T.R. Fehrenbach's book on the history of Mexico is must read for any body who wants to know the mind of those who are now coming across the border who seek a better life north. The book's 658 pages begins with conjecture of where the peoples who dominated the Valley of Mexico came from which leads to the Mexica people's domination of the regions around the shallow body of water known as Lake Texcoco. Their infatuation with the superstitious and the hostility that they engendered with surrounding tribes of Amerindians led to their destruction and the virtual wiping out of their culture within a generation. Unlike the fledgling United States, Mexico never got the chance to spread its wings of freedom and entrepreneurial spirit as it suffered under a mountain of bureaucracy and merchantilism imposed upon it by the central government in Madrid for three full centuries. Spain's grip on the New World started to ebb with its defeat of its Spanish Armada and suffered its coup de grace with Napoleon's occupation of the mother country. Mexico's problems needless to say did not end with its independence. Corruption and conflict continued up until very recently. In the end, it is understandable why many have migrated illegally into the American southwest and beyond.The book is well written with the full scope of the country's history covered. Endnotes are lacking which is a weakness, but it has an adequate bibliography and index. His treatment of the Mexicans is impartial given them the benefit of the doubt as they are of a different mindset formed by centuries of culture and civilization totally unrelated to the Anglo-Saxon. The one question that is left unanswered is how two cultures that are totally different can co-exist in one country. We will know the answer very soon."},{"Title":"The Epic of America","review":"Traditionally, we think of the American Dream as owning a home and having a happy family, with some undefined financial success often referred to as &quot;comfortable and high-standard living&quot;. The dream aspect of the American Dream, however, connotes a traditional and national vision, despite some of the mundane aspects of the dream as it is often defined. Immigrants in particular have seen America as a promised land, with the dream as an integral part of this vision. On the other hand, some see the American Dream as an unfulfillable vision, especially those whose race, ethnicity or gender the mainstream uses as an excuse for excluding them from dreaming. Others see it as relentlessly competitive and material and ruthless.For the first time in American history, John Truslow Adams, in this monumental work, The Epic of America (1933) coined the term, the American Dream and defined it as... that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement.... It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of a social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.Adams believed thatthe American dream that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, though that has doubtless counted heavily. It has been much more than that. It has been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in older civilizations, unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes than for the simple human being of any and every class. And that dream has been realized more fully in actual life here than anywhere else, though very imperfectly even among ourselves.Despite the fact that &quot;the American dream&quot; has been often deconstructed and sometimes attacked as the dream of a white and male-centred European culture, this books offers insights as to how the concept of the American dream was born during American history. This book is a must for students of American history and American literature."},{"Title":"The Epic of America","review":"I'm a book junkie. My favorite pastime is laying in my hammock with a book.

The answer is this book.Judging by the size I was expecting a long dry tome, something I'd have to fight throught. Instead The Epic of America is what a history book ought to be.

Next April 13th we Colorado citizens will again have a chance to choose our representatives through a system of neighborhood meetings. If we do not exercise this tool for the common person it will be lost forever.Thomas Jefferson said that we would need to have a revolution every 20 years; the Colorado caucus-assembly system provides a mechanism for doing just that without bloodshed.

I was thus delighted to find that this government branch has produced a quite beautiful volume, _History of the United States Capitol: A Chronicle of Design, Construction, and Politics_ by William C. Allen. It even has a publication note: \\"106th Congress, 2d Session / Senate Document 106-29 / Printed pursuant to H. Con. Res. 221,\\" but don't be put off by this. It may be an official US Government publication, but it is a large format book of almost five hundred glossy pages, it is well illustrated, and it is written with no touch of bureaucratese. Cynics alert: the government can do some things very well.Of course, that is what the book itself is about. The Capitol is a real triumph, a gorgeous building that does everything architecture can do to inspire hand-over-the-heart patriotic feelings. Underneath that magnificent dome are wings that are beautifully proportioned and decorated, and it comes as a surprise to learn just how much the building consists of additions that were never anticipated when its first stone was laid in 1793. Indeed, the splendid dome we see now was before just a smaller spherical cap without decoration, and the building consists more of additions than it does of the original structure. We may now think of the building as essentially finished; indeed, historic preservation activists have in recent decades prevented any major additions or changes, but for most of its history, the Capitol has been tinkered with and pieced together. In 1827, Representative Charles Wickliffe of Kentucky addressed the house to complain that the building was not yet finished, and that old men from his district who had worked on it were now amazed to find out that the work was incomplete. Almost ever since, elected representatives within the building have criticized the Capitol, bothered its funding, politicized the selection of architects, and in general acted like politicians. The building remains symbolic in this way: a magnificent outcome has arisen despite the arguing and shenanigans.The book describes the placement upon Jenkins Hill of the \\"Congress House\\" within the famous plan of the city drawn up by Pierre L'Enfant. It was Jefferson who insisted that that it be called a \\"capitol,\\" with roots deep in the Roman republic, emphasizing ancient principles of citizenship and self-government. There was a competition for the design of the original building, but there is not really one original architect, as it was built by compromise between various plans. George Washington insisted on a dome \\"for beauty and grandeur,\\" but thought it might be a good place to put a clock or a bell. It was the classicist Jefferson who advised Washington on the final design, and who worked intimately with B. Henry Latrobe to produce the initial structure. Prominent within it was the rotunda, with proportions taken almost directly from the Pantheon in Rome. The Jefferson - Latrobe partnership was enormously productive, but not without some conflict. Latrobe, for instance, was in favor of a \\"lantern\\" to be raised upon the dome as a means of covering it and allowing for light to enter, but Jefferson was clearly bound to classical precedent; he knew of no such lantern on classical buildings, terming them \\"degeneracies of modern architecture.\\" By the time the dome was really to be erected, the British had in 1814 burned much of the original building, and Charles Bullfinch designed a relatively low, spherical dome close to the desires of Washington and Jefferson.Latrobe was the first of the architects to deal with the Americanization of classical influence. For instance, the sculptors of the enormous eagle above the Speaker's rostrum produced a weird bird that was distinctly un-American. The Italian sculptor modeled the bird from memory, and it was only after shipments of anatomical parts of a bald eagle to the sculptor that we got an eagle whose inauthenticity would not \\"be detected by our Western Members.\\" Latrobe also designed novel columns for the inside of the building, capped by magnolias or graceful tobacco leaves rather than the classical acanthus. His most popular feature, however, were the corn columns, the body of which resembled stalks of corn tied together (rather than plain fluting), with a cap of ears of corn. Everyone liked them, and they enabled him to get extra appropriations.The architect who has most to do with the appearance of the Capitol as we know it was Thomas U. Walker, who entered the competition for the expansion of the building, once the old Senate and House chambers were acknowledged as too small. His design of wings for new chambers on either side of the old ones, and connected to them by narrow corridors, was approved by Millard Fillmore in 1851. Walker worked on the creation of the new chambers even though for most of his term the building project would be transferred to the War Department. It is not clear who had the idea for a vertical extension of the low dome into the splendid one we now see, but by the time a certain Representative addressed his colleagues about the fire hazard of the mostly wooden Bulfinch dome, Walker was already designing its replacement. Many of Walker's beautiful drawings and plans for the dome are reproduced here. The dome is of fireproof cast iron, painted to look uniform with the stone of the rest of the building. Miraculously, the colossal and ornate dome exceeded in weight the original, much smaller, masonry and wood dome by only twenty percent. It was not without controversy; there were many in architectural circles who insisted that buildings and materials must be honest and iron should not imitate stone, but this was never a controversy entered by the politicians. The dome had been started by the beginning of the Civil War, but the firm with the contract for the cast iron had over a million pounds of it on site, and kept working even though the government admitted that the war would postpone all payments. During the war, the Capitol was used as a bakery, a barracks, and a hospital. With the confusion of war, the grounds became trampled by hogs and goats, and they rubbed against and discolored the ironwork waiting installation. But the great dome was completed by the time the war was over.There have been extensions to all four sides of the Capitol, and many changes to the interior. While many of the historic decorations have been deliberately retained, a few (and it seems significantly few) changes have done serious damage to what went before. The author notes that the 1950s update of the Senate and House chambers took out all of the high Victorian decoration and replaced it with \\"pastiches of vaguely classical designs.\\" He sniffs, \\"Few connoisseurs today look upon the designs with satisfaction, nor has any student of Federal period architecture discovered either authenticity or wit among the details.\\" However, such dismissals are few in this gorgeous book. Allen is himself the architectural historian in the office of the Architect of the Capitol, and so his enthusiasm for the structure is not only obvious but it is exceedingly well informed. He has included the controversies, personality clashes, funding debates, and political bombast here, but nothing can obscure the success and the beauty of this remarkable building, a superbly American temple."},{"Title":"History of the United States Capitol: A chronicle of design, construction, and politics","review":"I fully agree with the above review in all its positive points. This book is superbly researched and superbly written, and it is well worth the very inexpensive price. It is by far the most detailed examination of the architectural history of the U.S. Capitol building that I have come across. However, the actual physical quality of the book leaves a great deal to be desired, which is why I have given this four stars instead of five. The printing job is lousy. Many words are struck out or compressed into the space of one letter. The illustrations look as if they were copied on an old and dirty photocopy machine. This is a particular problem with the photographs, some of which are almost undifferentiated black rectangles. Also, the captions indicate that some of the illustrations were obviously in color, although they are copied in black and white.I would recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the architecture of the U.S. Capitol, but I also would recommend that it be read with other books on the Capitol that have better quality illustrative material."},{"Title":"History of the United States Capitol: A chronicle of design, construction, and politics","review":"This is an amazingly complete history of the Capitol, which will give you an overall view of how it, like the country and government it represents, is a patchwork of personalities and compromises.

The Analects have always been a difficult and opaque work for me. I have read it several times over many years and have always found at least half the sayings completely incomprehensible. The Waley and Legge translations are dry and dated. Lau and Dawson are easier to read but still leave me puzzled about the meaning of most of the sayings. Some of their notes are useless and distracting, while others merely fail to inform. I was always left thinking of the Analects as a few clever and witty proverbs scattered throughout a strange and impentrable work.The Huang translation, on the other hand, is clear and easy to read. It is easy to follow the structure of the book. It has just the right amount of notes and they are located just underneath the analect itself--not at the bottom of the page or end of the book where you have to interupt your reading and look for them. The sayings that are easy to understand have no notes. The other sayings have notes that clarify the context and meaning. They are brief and to the point so that they don't get in the way of the text. Things that were impossible to understand are now clear. I find that I am no longer burdened by trying to decipher the meaning. As a result I am now getting to know the character and personality of each of the students, and enjoying their interaction with the Master. This is something I was never able to do before with other translations. Reading the Analects is no longer a chore but an enjoyable journey to a distant, but accessible, culture."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Granted, I haven't read other translations of the Analects, so my rating is for the book itself more than as a comparison to other translations.The fact that Confucius lived thousands of years ago is amazing to me ... the things he says apply to people throughout the ages, and they're full of wisdom. Having read the book, I find myself trying to be a bit more of a Confucian gentleman than I did before reading it. Confucius' teachings about humanity and being a gentleman span across the ages.I'm very glad I read this book. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I can't compare it to other translations, and it seems a little improper to rate a translated book without comparing it to other translations. But I personally found Leys' lines to be easily understandable and interesting, even if I have no way of ascertaining their accuracy with the original text.**7/31/09 UPDATE** I was looking to buy a copy of the Analects for a friend when I came across my own review when trying to decide between versions ... which is a somewhat strange feeling! I'm still not an \\"expert\\", but having read several more Chinese classics in the meantime, including a few versions of the Analects, I thought I would update this review. I think the Leys translation is a very good introduction to the Analects for someone who is looking for a starting point in Confucian thought. The translation is a little bit loose but flows well in English, the introduction gives a good amount of context without going overboard, and the notes are nicely situated at the end to prevent clutter. This makes it a good version for the Confucius novice, a comment I mean in earnest and not a backhanded compliment. That said, I have yet to find a translation that surpasses Waley's in its rigor and thoroughness; the copious notes and detailed introduction are excellent as well. However, Waley is likely to be a little more difficult for the newcomer to Confucius and Confucianism ... so he might not be the best starting point. As always, different translations work best for different people. Read the first couple of pages of a few versions and you'll quickly have an idea of what suits you. No matter which version you end up with, the Analects is a wonderful work, worthy of the praise it receives!"},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"The review above is uninformed. Even if he knows that the main Chinese phonetic system is called pinyin. If one reads the copious notes that back up the research in this translation, one would realize that every character is philologically proven. Whether by the lexicon Shuo Wen, the sea of words or other. This translation is the epitome of scholarly work. There is an unpresedented wealth of information in this book. There has been no one near the ability of Chichung Huang in understanding the ancient cannotations of Chinese characters. He has achieved a far more scholarly level in classical Chinese than any other Chinese scholar and translator that I have ever read. The amount of clear concise research proves it. His work is fluid, concise and true to the original exactly because the translator has the ability to be literal. His contemporaries are lacking in this regard. Ren does translate to mean humanity, as in the founding principles of humanity and rightiousness. Read the introduction please."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"As I bought this book as a gift for my daughter who cannot read Chinese, I compared this translation with the Chinese versions that I have. To understand the original analects fully, most Chinese books provides explanations and definitions. The author has done an excellent job in providing translations and explanations of the analects at the same time."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"This book is delightful, irritating, and utterly sui generis; the personality of its author is on every page. As a translation it is sometimes inspired--Leys has a knack for avoiding the very un-Chinese verbiage with which Lau and, sometimes, the generally superior Dawson clutter their lines. But it cannot be relied upon as a translation. In the first book the words \\"Rich but loving ritual\\" become \\"Rich but considerate.\\" Ritual (li) is one of the great themes of the Analects and it is either dishonest or shockingly clumsy to conceal its key presence in this important passage. At other times we descend from translation to mere paraphrase: \\"a state of a thousand chariots\\" becomes \\"a medium-sized state\\". I often found myself wishing that Leys had taken to heart Dawson's words: \\"I do feel that one should get as close to the original as possible....I do not think that it is entirely virtuous to produce a version which reads as if it were written at the end of the twentieth century.\\"The notes, to the degree that they comment on the text itself or on the translation choices, are illuminating only for someone who has read other translations and has something to compare them to. But what quickly becomes apparent is that, under the guise of a translation with notes, what we have here is something like an anthology. Borges, Pascal, Stendhal, C. S. Lewis, Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, even Pancho Villa and many others are given long and full quotes. Sometimes they shed light on the original. Sometimes there is only a tangential relationship; one gets the impression that Leys was simply reminded of something and decided to share it, as in a conversation. They are always very interesting: this is the delight of the book. It is as if a select dinner-party full of eccentrics and geniuses were having the Analects read aloud to them and invited to comment freely. Clearly we cannot recommend this version for someone new to Confucius! If you've never read Confucius before, you want to get into the China of the fifth century B.C. and stay there for a while, not constantly get pulled back into modern Europe. There is some danger that these quotes will shed too much of their own kind of \\"light\\" back onto the Analects--which is a very elliptical, minimal, suggestive text--and that the new reader's mind will come permanently to associate some of the ideas of, say, Pascal with those of Confucius. But if you are already familiar with Confucius (preferably through at least two or three other translations) and if you have a healthy interest in and knowledge of Western civilization, this book, taken for what it is, will be a delight.A couple of reviewers have commented on the anti-gay prejudice which comes up, I believe, twice in the notes. These passages really do vitiate the work. It is not only the prejudice itself; after all a good dish needs some spice and Leys is entitled to his opinion. But the whole issue is so obviously foreign to the Analects, the passages in which it comes up strike so discordant a note, that one wonders what they were doing here. And they are not, even in themselves, good or interesting: the ideas are banal and the tone verges on the mean-spirited. Leys constantly writes as if he were taking a friend into his confidence, and assumes that the intelligent friend will feel the same way he does. He gets away with this because his views are generally intelligent and because usually there is some fig-leaf of connection to the Analects to support it. But in these and a few other passages we are suddenly pulled up short by the realization that it is not wisdom but mere cantankerousness that we have on display. It is bad style, bad taste.I am giving this three stars because it is being sold as a translation of the Analects and that is what, as a translation, it deserves. As an anthology of quotes suggested by the Analects it might get five stars, with perhaps one taken out for the fault mentioned above.If you have never read Confucius and are looking for a good introductory translation, I recommend Raymond Dawson's."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"The importance of the historical use and misuse of the teaching of Confucius throughout the centuries in China can hardly be understated. While Confucian thought was on the outs with Communist intellectuals, others such as Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore point to Confucius' principles as the secret to the Asian economic tigers' success. Leys, the translator of this volume, notes that Chinese familiarity and historical misuse of Confucius prejudices many, but taken without these prejudices, Confucius is thoroughly modern in his application today.Confucius is known for being a great teacher, but it was politics and government that was his passion. Today, Confucius is a good source for leadership philosophy. Far from promoting authoritarian despotism, the teachings of Confucius point to a higher calling of leadership through service, character development, and self-abandonment - all sorely lacking in Chinese leadership today.To learn was Confucius' calling. He said he did not have much innate knowledge and studied literature and history to learn (6.27). The responsibility of learning was on the learner not the teacher: \\"I enlighten only the enthusiastic; I guide only the fervent. After I have lifted up one corner of a question, if the student cannot discover the other three, I do not repeat\\" (7.8). While that may sound harsh, Confucius practiced what he preached. \\"Put me in the company of any two people at random-they will invariably have something to teach me. I can take their qualities as a model and their defects as a warning\\" (7.22).Learning was to be put into practice; this showed integrity. The first verse of the Analects says, \\"To learn something new and then to put it into practice at the right time: is this not a joy?\\" (1.1). Again, \\"Learning is like a chase in which, as you fail to catch up, you fear to lose what you have already gained\\" (8.17). Here we see the high value of action resulting from learning and not only study. He valued doing what you say. \\"There was a time when I used to listen to what people said and trusted that they would act accordingly, but now I listen to what they say and watch what they do\\" (5.10). Doing what you say is the heart of personal integrity. \\"A gentleman would be ashamed should his deeds not match his words\\" (14.27).Learning was his way of improving himself in order to govern well. Three major themes surface in Confucius' teaching regarding those who govern: be a gentleman, keep the rites and maintain your humanity. A gentleman was a moral superior, someone worthy of leading. A person becomes a gentleman not through birthright but through learning and right actions. These actions are called ritual, which is similar to courteous behavior, and maintaining humanity which is treating people with respect, dignity, fairness, justice and generosity to name a few of the qualities that Confucius praises. Ritual and humanity develop character in a person, and a person with character is the one whom Confucius calls a gentleman.Confucius and his contemporary political and intellectual leaders wanted to make a name for themselves. In a way, they could live on through that reputation. \\"The Master said: \`A gentleman worries lest he might disappear from this world without having made a name for himself'\\" (15.20). However, in making a name a leader must not do evil or act without virtue.Official position was an obvious choice for ruling and making a name. Today, position is the most highly regarded form of authority all over Asia. Hear Confucius: \\"Do not worry if you are without a position; worry lest you do not deserve a position\\" (4.14). Again, \\"It is not your obscurity that should distress you, but your incompetence\\" (14.30). This is a powerful lesson for Chinese leaders to hear. Today too much emphasis is placed on leadership position, and not enough placed on competence and character. The results are personal empires, corruption, and incompetence that oppress those without power (position). \\"Before he gets his position, his only fear is that he might not get it, and once he gets it, his only fear is that he might lose it. And when he fears to lose it, he becomes capable of anything\\" (17.15).The wisdom available to contemporary readers goes on and on. I found this book extremely helpful for finding ancient Chinese cultural leadership principles that back up the principles of transformational leadership theory and servant leadership theory. I would like to read and reflect deeper to find Confucian principles that are not yet apart of contemporary models of leadership, but are consistent with it. This is a deeper task.Recently I have begun quoting Confucius during my leadership seminars. Although, a feel a bit dubious doing so - proof texting largely Western leadership principles with Confucius - the reaction from the participants has been enthusiastic. While many leaders are attracted to Western leadership theories, many also feel these theories are foreign. Many theories based on egalitarian social structure are foreign and are not appropriate for most cultures in Asia. However, some theories, working inside hierarchical social structures, are helpful but still smack of American \\"one, two, three\\" optimism. We are sometimes too brash and not mysterious enough, too left brained, in our presentations. Confucius has helped my audiences to embrace the principles I try to get across.I was surprised how readable, useful and contemporary the writing of Confucius is to me as a leadership consultant. He had a good grasp of humankind, and set the bar very high regarding how leaders should govern from character and justice. He encouraged people to higher traits of humanity, that if followed would make the world a much better place. We would do well to study and apply the teachings of Confucius."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"Confucius was born in approximately 551 B.C. Considered by many as a master; he was a teacher and political advisor in pre-imperial China. He lived in a time of transition. He saw his world sinking into violent behavior and barbarity. Confucius believed that he was chosen by Heaven to become the spiritual heir to the Duke of Zhou who had established a universal feudal order five hundred years before him, unifying the civilized world. In addition to his interest in politics, Confucius was also skilled at outdoor activities, such as handling horses and archery and was fond of hunting and fishing. While he is best known as a teacher, Confucius' true occupation was politics. He advised government officials on foreign affairs, diplomacy, finances, administration, and defense.In his introduction to the book, Simon Leys writes, \\"The Analects is the only place where we can actually encounter the real, living Confucius. In this sense, the Analects is to Confucius what the Gospels are to Jesus.\\" Confucius promoted humanist ethics and the universal brotherhood of man, inspiring many nations. Chinese emperors have promoted the official cult of Confucius for more than two thousand years. It became a sort of state religion. The Analects became the spiritual foundation of the Chinese world. This classic book gives the reader an understanding and appreciation of a philosophy that has survived throughout the ages and is just as pertinent today as it was when it was written.The word analects is defined as a collection of excerpts from a literary work. The Analects of Confucius are a collage of short dialogues, anecdotes and brief statements, mostly attributed to Confucius. Some of the statements are attributed to his disciples or rulers of the time. They were compiled around 400 B.C., about seventy years after Confucius' death, by two consecutive generations of his disciples and became what is considered the teachings of Confucius. The general intent of the text is to aid the reader in self-improvement so that the one might become a moral example for others. One might find the proper way to live and behave by practicing various virtues, thereby becoming a humane person or a gentleman. Confucius says that humanity is an accomplishment; one is not born humane, but one must learn to become so. Another definition of humanity is to love others. The practice of ritual action is the best way to express one's human kindness. Ritual action is not limited to state and religious functions, but covers the spectrum of human behavior. The book is organized into two parts. The first part contains the quotes of Confucius and others. The second part contains notes written by Simon Leys that explain words and concepts presented.Perhaps the true strengths of The Analects of Confucius are evident in the examination of the Confucian themes. The ideas of ethical behavior, moral conviction, self-improvement through education have stood the test of time and are evident in many other religions. As one reads the dialogues and anecdotes of this master, one gets the impression that he is speaking about the very problems of our day. The Analects are intended for an audience seeking, what Confucius called, \\"the supreme virtue of humanity.\\" In that sense, the book is intended for all of us.Walter S.

But, despite Simon Leys' beautifully written short introduction and his section of explanatory notes which is longer than the actual work, it escapes me why the Master should have gathered around himself such a band of devoted followers or why this book should have had such an enormous influence. Simon Leys and others claim how modern it is, i.e. how timeless. Much of what he says - that one should be righteous, just and courteous, should not show off, should practice what one preaches, should show self-control, should be aware of one's limitations - is indeed timeless - but that is because it is obvious.Those of his sayings which are not timeless - for example the huge importance he attributes to ritual (even given the glosses which Leys gives to the word), or the obedience due to the old - do not inspire much respect these days.Anyone who practices all these things is a gentleman, irrespective of birth. Anyone who does not is vulgar. Being a gentleman also involves a love of learning for its own sake, but Confucius shares the view of the philosophers of Ancient Greece that a gentleman should leave technical knowledge to others.He had a lot of fairly general things to say about politics (Aristotle is much more specific and analytical). Leys says that politics was \`his first and foremost concern' and that he hoped in vain to be called upon to be called upon by a ruler to reform a state, particularly the morality of politics. He had the naive view that if the ruler is virtuous, his people will be virtuous also.I apologize to the devotees of Confucius for my undoubted presumption in giving this classic only two stars."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius;","review":"well i bought this book back in college I was getting around to see what i have not review and i can tell you this book was horrible (i got an A in my class) but the book is very crude and I stop reading it past page 15.

It contains the hard-won wisdom of a lifetime. Much of it had been published elsewhere over the years--long before Joseph Campbell's sudden popularity-- but May felt strongly about making a cohesive statement regarding the vital importance of myth and how much we need it today. Myths are how we make meaning of life--no myth, no meaning. May's therapeutic approach to myths links him closely with figures such as Sigmund Freud, Otto Rank, and Carl Jung, and comprises an essential and enriching feature of May's own existential psychotherapy. In this fine collection, May analyzes the archetypal myths we are living out--or maybe better, that are being lived out through us--and offers some new myths and interpretations that may help us make it more meaningfully into the new millennium."},{"Title":"The Cry for Myth","review":"I read this book several years ago and I found it to be a fascinating read, from back to front. May's astute analysis of the place of myth within human life, sense of self and community is very sensible and relevant. Many may find his understanding of myth to be surprising, as it deviates greatly from the conventional existential perspective.From time immemorial, cultures have woven intricate, fantastic stories, parables, myths and guiding narratives about the world, helping them to understand the universe, carve out a unique place within it and establish values. As societies grew, cultures passed these myths and stories down to their descendants. Communal traditions developed from these myths and guiding narratives, building among participants a sense of cultural kinship, identity and solace. People derived strength and direction from their guiding narratives, and these myths unified individuals in a commonality, supplying them with a vision.Carl Jung's influence here is distinct, as May attributes the sense of meaninglessness, isolation and disoriented alienation of modern culture largely to the human \\"cry\\" for new myths (similar to Jung's Weltanschauung) that incorporate all facets of our humanity (both spirit and matter) and address our current reality.May defines the myth as follows: \\"A myth is a way of making sense in a senseless world. Myths are narrative patterns that give significance to our existence [...] myths are our way of finding meaning and significance. Myths are like the beams in a house; not exposed to outside view, they are the structure which holds the house together so people can live in it.\\" May is also careful to address our modern misunderstanding of what myth entails: \\"There can be no stronger proof of the impoverishment of our contemporary culture than the popular - though profoundly mistaken - definition of myth as falsehood.\\" Read the book for more on this and for a clearer understanding of how the traditional \\"myth\\" is distinct from things like fundamentalism, or dogma. Nowhere is myth more evident than literature and the rich, vivid literature of past cultures demonstrates this. In fact, May goes to great lengths in his analysis to amply illustrate the crucial need for literature and the arts.As scientific rationalism has swept in and usurped the position of omnipotent \\"God,\\" our sense of meaningful myth has been eroded, particularly in America, where a strong sense of rich, cultural myth has not been as rooted in our understanding of community as it has in other cultures. (May discusses an entire spate of prevalent American myths, as expressed through literature.) The technological advances of the industrial age have all but completely divorced humans from the natural world, further contributing to our schizoid sense of spirit and matter. All in all, this has resulted in a severe fragmentation of community and knowledge of self, as we believe the appreciation of myth to be beneath our superior rationality and reason.Despite this surface disdain for myth, we are still clinging to the old, impoverished myths which play a great role in our lives (\\"beams\\" in our \\"structure\\") and how we view the world, whether we realize it or not. We have not yet created new myths and guiding narratives to help us find meaning, and so we remain fragmented, repressed and separated from ourselves, the natural world and one another.Like Jung, May asserts that self-knowledge and communal anchor arise from the search for the spiritual and awakening of the spiritual consciousness. May further asserts that our rejection of myth has left us drifting along, leaving us prone to depression, mental illness, dysfunction and fundamentalism of all kinds.One of the elements I most appreciate about Rollo May is his ability to elegantly write readable books, without muddying the waters or losing the reader in a fog of dense language. I think that anyone who loves classic literature will also love this book, thanks to May's thorough discussion of Faust among a number of other literary and mythical characters."},{"Title":"The Cry for Myth","review":"Rollo May was a psychologist, but don't let that bit of information scare you away from reading this book. May examines the importance of mythology thru the ages, as well as its nexus with psychology and psychological theories. In doing so, May points out the didactic properties that myths have had throughout human history.Along the way, May takes a critical look at fairy tales and discloses hidden &quot;messages&quot; that we normally pick up on only subliminally. His inquiry helps to elucidate many of the themes that we teach to our children, and hints at why fairy tales have such an abundant popularity in diverse cultures.May also describes to us how myths evolve and develop over time, changing with the sociological paradigms of each successive epoch. In doing so, he uses the Faust legend as an example. The text offers some nice highlights on the transcendence of the motif as it was first penned by Christopher Marlowe and subsequently revised by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Thomas Mann.This is an excellent read for anyone who is interested in mythology, and is a serious warning of the consequences that go along with marginalizing the importance of liberal arts."},{"Title":"The Cry for Myth","review":"I had thought that this book would be nothing more than some guy doing a lot of self-serving agrandizement of what I believe to be a non-existent profession, i.e. psychology. But I was wrong.In chapter 1, when May quotes W.B Yeates--\\"Science is the critique of myth,\\" I became hooked. For this quote and its timing in the text shows the recognition of genius. 99.99% of psychology may be utter garbage and 99.99% of all psychologists may very well be parasitic biomass, but here is the 0.01%. Rollo May seems to have transcended his profession.In chapter 2, what did May's patient mean by \\"Satan was a Rebel for God\\"? Here May has a foot-note that Lucifer, the devil was apparently envious of Christ and that's what made him evil according to St. Thomas Aquinas.From Chapter Eight, page 128: \\"THE GREAT GATSBY is Fitzgerald's spiritual autobiography. He uses the word 'forever' often in this book. Maxwell Perkins [his editor] wrote him, 'You are able with an occasional glance at the sky to impart a sense of eternity.'\\""},{"Title":"The Cry for Myth","review":"Rollo May's &quot;The Cry for Myth&quot; is a testimony on American mythology. A fantastic novel, it encompasses a variety of issues by relating them to classic pieces of literature, such as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot;. The book was a pleasure to read (and I don't even like to read). It opened my mind to think in different ways."},{"Title":"The Cry for Myth","review":"May is a seminal thinker in existential philosophy, along with Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Tillich, Franz Kafka and Albert Camus. For May, myths help us make sense out of an often senseless world. His concern was that the myths of our post-modern world were becoming shallow images of what they once were and that their use was sacrificed. He states \\"Many of the problems of our society, including cults and drug addition, can be traced to the lack of myths which give us inner security in order to live adequately in our day (p.9).\\" The fact that Mays was a practicing therapist gives added credence to his argument that the lack of such myths contribute to the mental problems of many people.Lonliness is epidemic in modern society. We spend our lives burying ourselves in mental boxes that reassure us and prop us up. Unfortunately, this avoidance and fragmentation leads to existential anxiety. May argues that we are all driven by existential anxiety and the only way to defeat it is to form our own myths in order to make sense of our world. Facing life's conflicts involves short-term costs (pain, loneliness,) but leads long-term benefits (fulfillment, happiness). May compares a man trying to live outside of myths to a man without a country, a man banished from his community, tying it to the sense of fragmentation that seems to mark modern society. This \\"lonely search for internal identity\\" is why we need myths. Myths permit us to confront our mental rigidity and confront deeper meaning in our lives. We need to embrace these conflicts and delve deeper into them. We need to deeper purpose to help us seek our way on our journey of life.A few of the myths explored by May include:1. The myth of the \\"new\\" frontier,2. The Horatio Alger rags-to-riches drama (The American Dream),3. Peer Gynt conflict between demanding a woman's admiration and desiring her care4. Gatsby's obsessive and futile dream of self-creation5. \\"Briar Rose\\" version of the Sleeping Beauty tale,6. Faust's deal with the devilIt's not surprising that so many people are disillusioned and looking in all the wrong places for happiness. Every individual needs to make the journey in his and her own unique way. For Rollo May, myths are the tap to the unconscious and the means for gaining understanding of our lives. We identify with myths because they help us to articulate, or to see more clearly, what we've already sensed. Myths can be used as exploratory analysis of to help us face life's challenges. As described by Joseph Conrad, a myth is a \\"secret opening through which the inexhaustible energies of the cosmos pour into human cultural manifestation.\\" In other words, myths do not originate from the external empirical world, but emanate from within you. Ultimate reality and self-identity comes through a journey that is defined by myths and how these myths resonate within us."},{"Title":"The Cry for Myth","review":"I need to know who to contact about this.

Each chapter focusses on a different body part and contains a number of (variations of) known &amp; quite original exercises. Each exercise is accompanied by a precise description and a large photo. Although the descriptions are quite clear, I would have liked a stepwise description and/or more than one photo per exercise (although some exercises are accompanied by more photos).The book ends with special exercise programs for people who have e.g. back problems or who sit behind a desk all day.My general impression is that this is a good book full of usefull exercises. The author seems to have lots of experience (which lead to comments &amp; tips each exercises). She stresses the importance of correct breathing and this really makes a difference. If you're looking for a book to improve a specific part of your body: this should be a good buy. If you're looking for a daily program, you'd have to design it yourself, taking exercises from different chapters."},{"Title":"Emergency Ultrasound","review":"I purchased this book in order to establish an emergency ultrasound program for our Remote Site Medical Services company. The book does not assume any prior knowledge of ultrasound, and thus is a useful reference for our paramedics. It is heavily illustrated with actual ultrasound images for each condition. The focus is on US in trauma (our primary concern) or FAST- Focused Abdominal Survey for Trauma, but also includes various gynelogical and medical conditions which typically present to the ED. There are a couple of drawbacks: this is written as a typically dry medical textbook, and not as a handbook or study guide for a short US program, despite the blurb above. Thus, most of the illustrations are B&W;, with most of the drawings that show the outline of the anatomical structures displayed in the US being just simple line drawing. I think more enlightening would have been actual cadaver anatomy photos (See NcMinn's Color Atlas of Human Anatomy) referenced, as well as MRI and CT scan images, to give the student a better grasp of how to correlate US images to actual anatomy.James Dawdy, CEPPromed Global Solutions, LLC"},{"Title":"Billy Joel: An Illustrated Biography","review":"The authors managed to make this fun and very readable biography a worthy contribution to the field of rock bios.

Teresa Wentzler's designs are stunningly complex, intricate, and challenging, but the results are oh so beautiful.For anyone who may be wondering, the Wentzler designs included in this book are:Rapunzel; Day and Night (depicted as two ladies in flowing garb); Magical Night (pegasi draw a sleigh through the sky); Carousel; The Castle Sampler; Stroke of Midnight (Cinderella flees from the ball); The Castle (pictured on the cover); Pegasus; UnicornPicking a favorite out of these is next to impossible. I bought it on account of the gorgeous dragon in The Castle, but fell equally in love with the Unicorn, a wistful nighttime scene to be stitched on black fabric, and the Pegasus, who poses next to a forest pool with wings held high. Wentzler's designs are like oil paintings in their use of light, achieving an especially fine, sunlit effect in Pegasus and Rapunzel. There isn't a weak one in the entire bunch. The photos of the finished pieces are very nice, and this book would be worth getting just as an art book.If there is any drawback to these designs, it's that they are on the difficult side to stitch. There is no color used on the charts, so you just have to keep track of all those different little markings, and Wentzler designs require a lot of blended threads and quarter stitches. Bear in mind the results are worth it! Beginning stitchers should not so much avoid this book as tuck it away in their collections as something to look forward to stitching once they have had more practice."},{"Title":"Best of Teresa Wentzler: Fantasy Collection","review":"Even if you already own all or most of the individual leaflets that are in this collection, this book is well worth buying. The greatest improvement over the original leaflets is that the different colors of backstiching are all marked differently--no more guessing!If you've never done any of Teresa Wentzler's designs, be forewarned that they are quite a challenge, but the results make the effort worthwhile. They contain a level of intricate detail that I have rarely encountered in cross-stitch patterns."},{"Title":"Best of Teresa Wentzler: Fantasy Collection","review":"What a wonderful book! Clear, concise patterns that give so many options.

This is just an example of the versatility of TW's designs. All however, are exquisite in their intended state.Easy to follow(even at 3 in the morning and bleary eyed, I had no problem understanding the explanations), and not 'quaint' ; she approaches the topic of mythology in needlework in a very sober, mature manner.

All the charts are in black and white and most of the pieces require at least thirty or more colors of thread, so if and/or when you decide to purchase or work from this book be sure that you're willing to devote a lot of time and effort to the projects to do them justice fully.

The designs are beautiful and intricate, but the charts are complicated with many different symbols and lots of color combining of threads. It would be so much easier if the charts were in color. I was not at all disappointed in the designs, but color charts sure would make it less of a hassle to stitch these beautiful designs. I'm not going to let that stop me though! It's hard enough to find good projects worthy of all the hours of stitching we spend to let good designs go un-done.

After all, I think it does not take much wisdom to realize that this barrier serves two useful purposes. First, it saves lives, by reducing the number of suicide bombing attacks directed against Israelis. And second, when someone does manage to get past that barrier, it is unlikely that they can claim to have crossed it unintentionally!My own feeling is that those who strongly oppose the security barrier probably are unhappy about the fact that it is saving lives. Sidman is more than justified in saying that \\"Carter displays no understanding or sympathy for Israelis whose lives have been snuffed out\\" by the terrorists.Sidman concludes that Carter's book is an egregious attack on Israel and the Jewish people. I agree.

The authors assert that class and status are at the heart of a series of struggles for control of Bedford Village's landscape. By insisting upon the retention of a particular aesthetic for the town, enforced through laws, zoning, advisory boards, and social pressure, the people of Bedford Village are for the most part able to successfully cloak class, race, and power struggles in aesthetic terms that are less volatile and seemingly apolitical. By this they manage to create and sustain a place-based identity that isn't always savory, although--and this is an important point--this would surprise the residents of Bedford as much as it would surprise many others who took such a hard look at where and how they live.The Duncans rightly place class at the center of Bedford's issues and, with almost equal force, money. This seems right as it pertains to Bedford, where houses cost up to millions of dollars and yet where there are long-time residents who, while living much more modestly, engage just as strenuously in the pressure to sustain the particular pastoral character of the town's landscape. But maintaining the \\"look\\" of the land masks other issues. In Chapter Two the Duncans assert that \\"[i]n capitalist societies...where identity is linked to possessions, the aesthetic often plays an important role in depoliticizing class relations\\" (p. 25). The residents of Bedford cling tightly to a vision of their town as a rural, historic, Colonial town and landscape, drawing from it all the symbolic force of the New England Village (cf Meinig) from which they claim to descend and using it as the primary locus and signifier of their identity. They resist at nearly every turn the pressures of development and modernization while taking full advantage of the amenities of the modern world just beyond the borders. To a great extent Bedford Village still looks rural, still has its pastoral charm and its romantic vistas. It even has dirt roads (maintained at great expense). This is (of course/ironically) what makes Bedford the perfect place to live. Its perfection _for a certain category of people_ is confirmed in the language of the real estate ads that amount to coded appeals to Anglo sensibilities, 19th-century English nostalgia, and an invented historicism. In sum, the web of issues that surround the production and sustenance of Bedford's landscape constitutes an aestheticized view of the world and is so powerful and pervasive it seems simply natural, without malice, \\"uncontestable\\" (p. ? --sorry).When class relations are centered on aesthetics, other consequences that reach into arenas beyond landscape and beyond the town are hidden even if they are unintended. Residents of Bedford frame the most important issues in terms of protecting the environment, protecting the rural character of the town, or protecting its historic structures, trees, and greenspaces; arguments typically accepted (here, in the U.S.) as benign, even noble. While the Duncans don't go so far as to say that they never are, it is fascinating to follow them as they probe how this framework obscures an inherent hegemony of class and, worse, can lead to a latent racism against \\"Guatemalans\\" in Chapter Eight. Bedford was largely built on exploited labor and is increasingly maintained by it, even if both facts are equally inadmissible to the dominant sensibility. Although \\"popping Bedford's bubble\\" wasn't the direct aim of the authors, by the end of the book I was convinced that nearly everything about Bedford was artificial in some way, the result of a complex interweaving of class and social forces that go mostly unnoticed. I especially like the authors' use of the term \\"performance\\" to describe the interplay of these forces and their materialization on and production through the landscape. It seems to strike squarely at how Bedford is more than just a place; it is the resulting effect of many individual \\"actors\\" including people, the land, the market, the immigrants, the history, the buildings, class relations, etc. In combination these constitute the thing that is \\"Bedford.\\" In this way, every place is artificial (i.e., \\"denaturalized\\") if you want to think of it that way.The Duncans write clearly and forcefully and for the most part, jargon-free. They strive (as professional geographers at Cambridge) to retain an objective viewpoint. This book is not meant to tattle or to reduce people to sets of selfish causes. I imagine other places could have served as well, but in this book Bedford Village is taken as a case study upon which to build the theoretical argument that aesthetic claims serve as convenient and effective codes for political and cultural issues."},{"Title":"Management of Spinal Cord Injury (Jones & Bartlett Series in Nursing)","review":"The best so far. &quot;Must read&quot; for nurses working in Spinal COrd Injury areas - acute or rehab. &quot;Must have&quot; book for orthopaedic/spinal units.

The result is a very readable and damning history of various Euro-American attempts to periodically convert, educate, or eliminate the Indian and Indian culture from the land.Wilson provides a region by region and tribe by tribe narrative of the attempts by the Europeans to move the Indian out of the way of advancing Euro-American civilization. The viciousness, intended and otherwise, of these policies and practices is told from the point of view of the Indian peoples who had to undergo this &quot;my way or the highway&quot; approach as they were moved relentless into the concentration areas we like to call reservations.The destruction brought upon the Indians from the attempts of Lord Amherst, in pre-revolutionary time, to kill them off with presents of blankets infected with smallpox, to the slaughter of Iriquois women and children in upstate New York during Washington's administration, to the indifference of Jefferson to landgrabs from the Indians in violation of treaties which the government never intended to abide by, to the seizures of Indian land encouraged by the Indian-hating Andrew Jackson, is all there down to the political manipulation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in our own time.For one not familiar with the real history of how the American Indian was violently removed from the land, this book will be an eye-opener.

Every people has been victim and oppressor at one time or another, yet Wilson makes no attempt to deal with this essential fact of life. Wilson is no scholar, but merely an informed writer with a special interest in the confrontation between the Indian and the white man. His book does not even begin to approach the requirements for good historical writing and the reader is left with the impression that the Indians rarely fought with or dispaced one another. The dynamics of life on the Indian frontier are completely absent from this book as is any semblence of fairness toward white people.This book cannot rightfully be subtitled &quot;A History of Native America&quot; as it is more a story of the most conspicuous examples of white people doing harm to the Indians. Surely a history of Native American should include facts about Indian life and customs other than &quot;creation mythology.&quot; Surely, Wilson could have treated the Shawnee, Ottawas, Ojibwas, Apache, Blackfoot, Utes, and the Comanche to a page or two! But, his agenda does not include most of these peoples who evidently don't fit the profile. The dynamics of tribal life among the various peoples, one would think, are important to a &quot;history of Native America,&quot; yet, these are almost completely absent from the work, while ample space is given to the deeds of Indian haters like John Chivington. The lives of great Indian men and women are evidently of little importance to Wilson, but the deaths of Indians at the hands of whites seem central to his narrative. Noteworthy Native Americans like Tecumseh, The Prophet, Little Turtle, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Joseph Brant Pontiac, and Sequoyah are hardly mentioned in Wilson's book, while Chato, Nana, Victorio and his exceptional sister Lozen, Manuelito, Geronimo, Cochise, Osceola, and Sacajawea are nowhere mentioned. Wilson says virtually nothing about the Hopewell, Adenas, Anazazi people, or the great Mississippi culture and its metropolis of Cahokia. Because they were not slaughtered by white men, I guess, Wilson didn't consider it necessary to include them.A central feature of Wilson's book is the extensive use of quotation from white men who despised the Indians and thought &quot;the only good Indian is a dead one.&quot; Wilson is not balanced or scholarly enough to realize that most Indians who hated whites and spat venom, unlike their white counterparts, did not leave a paper trail. In Wilson's world, all racism seems to flow one way. Nowhere are men like Tom Jeffords mentioned or the fact that Abraham Lincoln personally intervened to save the lives of hundreds of Indians at the conclusion of &quot;Little Crow's War.&quot;If you are looking for a summary of the most terrible treatment the Indian was dealt by the white man, then Wilson's book can provide you with a good start. But, if you want a genuine history of Native America, you had better look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America","review":"i have not read this book yet. i am looking forward to reading it because it was a gift from a gifted man"},{"Title":"The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America","review":"Native Americans did suffer tremendous injustices at the hands of EuroAmericans - no student of history could deny that. Mr. Wilson, however, makes his case by continually trivializing any hint of violence or savagery on the part of Indian raiders in order to paint his simplified portrait of white/Native relations. There are two sides to any story, and while the Native side was woefully slighted in the nineteenth and early 20th century histories, the solution is not to whitewash the story in the other direction. Mr. Wilson frequently makes sweeping assertions (claiming that Pequot warriors never tortured prisoners or even killed when it was unnecessary) without the slightest citation to back up his refutation of documented facts."},{"Title":"The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America","review":"Unfortunately, any book that seeks to redress &quot;historical imbalance&quot; by putting the remaining myths of aboriginal peoples on par with scientific data fails at its assigned task.

James Wilson has taken a place in that queue with this sweeping study of how native peoples were displaced, deceived, diseased and nearly destroyed. It isn't pleasant reading, but conquest never is when told from the view of the conquered. Wilson attempts to provide a whisper of that voice with as many native peoples' accounts as he could obtain. The result vividly demonstrates the disparity of outlook between the Europeans and those they overran over the course of five centuries.Although no attempt is made to preface the arrival of Columbus with some account of the previous life of North American native peoples, the text recounts their legends and mythology as they are encountered. Only a smattering of paleoanthropology is offered, and the &quot;consensus&quot; version of Native American origins is dismissed out of hand. Wilson's regional approach is a refreshing departure from the usual chronological format. However, since the focus is on the 48 contiguous States, region and chronology aren't all that distinct.The issues are land and culture, with a seasoning of racism. The native American &quot;used&quot; the land while the Europeans &quot;owned&quot; it. Native American culture was disparate, often locked into local conditions. Europeans imported a hierarchical society and imposed it wherever they went. Since they went all across the continent, continual clashes were inevitable - and the Europeans won nearly all of them. By the end of the 19th Century, the &quot;Indian&quot;, if not extinct, had lost the continent and nearly all culture. According to Wilson, that was precisely what the invaders intended. Where slaughter failed, assimilation could still force disappearance of the &quot;native&quot; from society.Attempts to rectify, or at least ameliorate what had occurred over the years, were doomed to failure. The variety of cultures among the Indian nations made consistent policy by the federal government impossible. State government attempts, feeble at best, were worse. The closest to a rational policy for dealing with the remaining Indians in the 20th Century were due to one man - John Collier. Starting in the 1920s, Collier struggled to restore some form of the original culture of Native Americans. His programme, now referred to as the &quot;Native New Deal,&quot; was based on his own search for a solution to world problems of the era. Years of effort were rewarded by his appointment as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The onset of the Great Depression gave Collier ample opportunity to propagandize his cause as an alternative to the failure of the dominant culture. His efforts to achieve a form of &quot;home rule&quot; for the Indian population is reflected in many programmes still under consideration today. He has left a long, and generally unrecognized, legacy.Those bemoaning the &quot;lack of balance&quot; in this book overlook the fact that Europeans were the invaders and despoilers. The spectrum of philosophies regarding the &quot;Noble Savage&quot; uniformly fail to address precisely what Wilson does here. An alien culture displaced another, native one, using whatever means necessary. It's a sad, but true, chronicle. Wilson's depiction of it makes dreary reading, but that's due to events, not his style. A fine introduction to the past relationship of conquerors and conquered, this book concludes with a realistic account of the present situation. With increasing demand for resources by the planet's most avaricious society, sustaining or restoring Indian culture is a remote ambition. The clash of cultures remains an issue, which this book clearly outlines.

Although there are many things one could find to fault in this book, there is no better overview. I especially like the way the author (a white man from Britain) weaves together orthodox academic opinion with Native voices. Wilson's book deftly combines a chronological approach with organization by regions. In each region he highlights general patterns, but then focuses much of the narrative on a few representative tribal histories. Had he tried to write about all of the more than 500 tribes, nations, villages, and bands of Native North America, he would have produced an unreadable book. Instead, he selects those groups that allow him to give enough detail to keep the narrative flowing, while also emphasizing the interrelations of peoples and places that are central to the best history. Throughout the narrative, he offers long quotes from published versions of Native orature.This book is an exceptional introduction to the history usually suppressed or misrepresented in schools and colleges. It is accessible to high school and college level readers, but can even add to the store of knowledge of experts in American Indian history. It has become the core text in many of my classes."},{"Title":"The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America","review":"If you are searching for a book about Native American history, this is the book for you. James Wilson's research is presented in three digestable sections: Origins, Invasion, and Internal Frontiers, with the largest body of work appearing in the central section. I recently took an 8,000 miles drive around the United States and read this book the entire month as I entered corresponding areas (such as Southwest, Far West, Great Plains, etc).Taking Wilson's book on my trip was a smart choice because not only did I experience the sites and people he describes, but his book enabled me to also see into the past, as it were, of these Native People. Wilson's research combines oral history (which will break your heart), political history and analysis, archeology, and ethnography. Several qualities make Wilson's book different from others. First, his research is current and fairly presented. For example, he provides an overview of various theories used to explain the disappearance of the great Puebloan societies so readers can appreciate the variety of ideas and political interests of the theorists. In addition, his synthesis of Native American histories in the forms of stories (and explanation of rituals) with that of modern analyses makes this book even more valuable.It is clear that Mr. Wilson's heart and conscience is with the Native Americans, and that, above all else, is what makes this book powerful. If it lacks anything, in my opinion, it is the addition of visual aids. A few maps and photographs would have made this text even more powerful. But if you want to read about the tragedy of evil White politics, the demise of many beautiful societies and their relationships before contact,this book holds nothing back. It is a passionate, digestable, and truthful history of the horrors inflicted (past and present)on original people. END"},{"Title":"The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America","review":"This book offers a true look at American history and offers more insight than the traditional books on American history whose idea of being comprehensive is starting with the history of England and the Magna Carta and only mentions the original Americans in passing. The author has a rare gift for consolidating history and for comparing and quoting other writers in order to create a well-written and coherent work.This is first and foremost a chronological history. However, it also seeks to dispel myths and stereotypes about \\"Native Americans\\" as being the noble savage, primitive Zen masters in tune with nature, and the \\"Vanishing American.\\" He shows how the Anglo society has had vacillating opinions about American Indians over the centuries. On the other hand, in his Prologue, he states, \\"I want to make it clear, though, that I am not setting out to reveal 'finally -- the truth behind the myth!': there is no single 'truth' to reveal, and no single 'myth' concealing it.\\"Other books about American Indians try to serve as an encyclopedia of documenting the various cultures as though there is a static photo in time of a group of individual cultures that was wiped away. Instead, this book is history, dynamic and alive. It tells American history from both sides and contrasts the seemingly irreconcilable viewpoints of Europeans and Native Americans.About the only downside to this book that I have found is somewhat having the notion of \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" instead of seeing himself as part of the continuous fabric of American culture. For example he writes, \\"Unlike 'native' peoples in Africa and Asia, indigenous Americans have not decolonized, and we have not been forced [. . .] to see them in a fundamentally different role.\\" It is important not to be thrown off by the incendiary title of the book. This is not a work of propaganda or a work merely cataloguing atrocities in order to evoke sympathy. Instead, it tries to be impartial and tell the way that history really happened, like it or not.Although same may say that \\"the Earth Shall Weep for Good Scholarship\\", accusations that the book is one-sided are simply not true. It certainly does show the European and Anglo cruelty and violence, but it also does not make all the Indians seem like martyrs and saints. It mentions numerous times that Indians attacked European settlers, often as the aggressors. It also mentions the ruthless opportunism and violence caused by Pequots and their leader Wonkus.It is true that the book does often quote vilifying passages written by European settlers showing disregard for Native Americans and lack of remorse over the attempted genocide. It's true that many of the original Americans may not have left a \\"paper trail\\" as much as the European invaders. The Shawnee Tenskwatawa is quoted as saying that the Anglo-Americans \\"grew from the scum of the great water, when it was troubled by an evil spirit and the froth was driven into the woods by a strong east wind. They are numerous, but I hate them.\\" And also: \\"War now. War forever. War upon the living. War upon the dead; dig up their corpses from the grave; our country must give no rest to a white man's bones.\\"However, there is a good reason why the book makes it seem like there was more violence perpetuated by the Europeans: because it was ultimately true. To say that \\"Wilson is not balanced or scholarly enough\\" is simply false.What make this book a great history is that it does not stop at Wounded Knee, the traditionally recognized end of the \\"Indian Wars\\". And the author points out that from the Native American perspective, \\"it also marks the beginning of a new struggle.\\" Unfortunately, after Wounded Knee, the book does not describe what was going on with various tribes across various regions of the country in as much detail as previously. Instead, it focuses more on all the Federal government programs designed to assimilate the Indians, and it provides much detail about these.It also explains the continuing conflicts between Euro-American and American Indian cultures, the struggles of those who try to consider themselves \\"Indians\\", and the clash of ideas between the \\"traditionals\\" and \\"progressives\\". It ends on a rather optimistic note, showing that the original American cultures have not been wiped out, despite all the vast number of attempts. Furthermore, culture can constantly change, and a culture changing is not the same as ceasing to exist.Also check out Fire and Blood, A History of Mexico, by Joseph Fehrenbach."},{"Title":"The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America","review":"I've read a fair amount about Indian history and this is one of the best books out there.

I learned many things from the book -- so many that when I turned to the notes to find out how I might learn more about some of the fascinating things Wilson informed me about, I was frustrated because I couldn't figure out his sources.

Finally, Cantor did not \\"name\\" 2^aleph0 \\"aleph1\\", he conjectured that this *equation* was true, this is precisely CH.\\"To this day we still don't know exactly how many irrationals there are, although it has been established that the total number cannot be more than aleph1.\\"We don't know the aleph number of the irrationals, but that's because we don't know the aleph number of the reals. And it's completely wrong to say it \\"cannot be more than aleph1\\". It can be any aleph(x) where x > 0 has uncountable cofinality. This is about as far from \\"cannot be more than aleph1\\" as you can get!!\\"Cantor himself guessed that the total number of irrationals is exactly aleph1, mainly since aleph1 is the next largest infinity after aleph0 defined by set theory. His guess came to be known as the Continuum Hypothesis. But there is still the uneliminated possibility that the number of irrationals actually lies between aleph0 and aleph1.\\"Laughable. There are NO cardinals between aleph0 and aleph1, by definition. Duh."},{"Title":"Bridges to Infinity the Human Side of Mathematics","review":"This book tells me that Georg Cantor's work in mathematics is ready to be taught in high schools. Earlier books on Cantor are too mathematical, hide truths about life, and hide God from the general public. The author brings life into Cantor. The problem is that mathematicians have removed life out of Cantor's work by rejecting God and God's determinate infinity.The author's discussion of mathematics on p.19 should be given lots of attention. There, he has words of Imre Lakatos and Morris Kline on the danger of logic. My recent book on 'The First Scientific Proof of God' shows that some opposing concepts can coexist, but only if God exists. By taking Cantor's work into the high schools, mathematicians might learn that their work can be unified with life and that God really exists."},{"Title":"Chronic Candidiasis: Your Natural Guide to Healing with Diet, Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, Exercise, and Other Natural Methods","review":"An excellent, quick read.

After my symptoms reached a critical stage, I got this book, and also consulted an OMD. After following the advice in the book as well as the advice of my OMD, after about 3 to 4 weeks, all of the conditions were gone, the candida was back into its proper balance, and I haven't felt this good in years!

The armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan were arrayed on the borders and other Arab nations such as Iraq sent forces to participate in the battle. In one of the most stunning military victories of all time, the Israeli defense forces swept the Arab armies aside and in six days conquered substantial territory. Some of that territory is still held by Israel forty years later and the debate as to what to do next began in Israel almost from the day after the six-day war ended.This book is part of that debate; in it several of the Israeli citizen-soldiers discuss their feelings about their Arab opponents and the war. They describe what it was like to kill the opposing soldiers, how they dealt with the Arab civilians when they moved into their territory and what direction they believe Israel and the neighboring nations should take. It is a very candid discussion and the opinions are varied, although most do not express a general hatred of the Arabs. What hatred is expressed is reserved for the Arab leadership, particularly the Egyptian leader Nasser. The Israeli soldiers express genuine sympathy for their Arab counterparts, they understand that both sides shooting at each other was an unfortunate natural order of things.Amidst the decades of hot and cold blowing wars between Israel and the Arabs, there is some hope that a reasonable compromise acceptable to both sides can be found. Some of that hope is expressed here, as the overwhelming opinion is that Israel just wants to be left alone and that there be an end to the killing."},{"Title":"the seventh day: soldiers talk about the six-day war","review":"This book illustrates the miraculous similarity between Gods creation of the world in six days and the Six Day war which replaced Jerusalem back in the hands of the Jewish people in six days and then rested on the seventh. Israel was partitioned in 1948 but the state did not have its eternal capital. However in six days it was recreated and the emotional spiritual story of non religious secular kibbutz soldiers is the special magic of this book. It truly touches on the most sensitive issues of israeli values. Worth the read."},{"Title":"Dog Island","review":"This book is good, but not as good as the first.

Two months after his sibling's death, someone kills the artist-husband of Susan Fitzsimmons. Tom sees a connection between the two murders. He directs his inquiries that way, stirring up a hornet's nest (see SINS OF THE BROTHER) that leaves Susan hospitalized. Mike still feels guilty for causing harm to Susan.Susan calls to inform Tom that a teenage girl is in deep trouble after witnessing a hit. Although he realizes the danger, Tom feels euphoric that Susan even talked to him. Tom visits Susan and Carli Monroe to hear the latter's story. He believes Carli. They get the local sheriff to accompany them to the house where the hit occurred. However, no evidence remains as even the walls have been repainted. Tom and an associate stay at the home, which leads to three thugs trying to kill them. They escape and place the two females in a safe house until Tom can keep the duo from becoming the next two victims.The action starts on the first page and keeps on going until the book is finished. However, Deep South atmosphere and strong characters keep the tale from being just a runaway action adventure. A sweet subplot involving Tom and Susan's growing attraction lessons some of the tension that seems ready to overwhelm the plot. Mike Stewart balances the powerful action with strong personalities and an engaging look at the Mobile area turning DOG ISLAND into an enjoyable tale."},{"Title":"Dog Island","review":"After reading two pages of Dog Island, I knew this was a book I had to finish.

The story moves at a good pace and provides plenty of thrills and some graphic violence. The lead character, Tom McInnes, seems to smart off quite a bit when he's surrounded by the enemy, which seems somewhat stupid, but other than that he's quite likable. An overall smoothly written novel laced with humor and bodies. I'm looking forward to the follow up to this novel, which is obviously to be expected, because of the unexpected....Recommended for thrills and mystery."},{"Title":"Dog Island","review":"There is a prototypical hero who has become all but generic. He is clever, often a lawyer, has more moxie than muscle; he is an honorable man, determined to keep his word at all costs. He always has a &quot;partner&quot; who's a behemoth type, big and brawny and techno-savvy. And these two buddies toss banter back and forth while in the midst of life-and-death situations. Then there's the love interest; she's lovely and wise and wounded. The hero and his cohorts vary only in locale. Dog Island's setting is Florida, with side trips back to our hero, Tom McInnes's, home base in Mobile. One of the primary features of books featuring these types of characters is an endless itinerary; we get the names of every highway between Mobile and Appalachicola, as well as routes to anywhere else McInnes has to go. I've often wondered why so many mystery writers feel compelled to give endless details (like AAA trip maps) of where they're going and how they get there.There are a couple of crusty old ex-military coots who come in very handy, a mysterious hispanic fellow of great charm (with good suits), a sexually abused teenager who teeters on the edge of believability, and everything is set in motion by this teenager's witnessing a murder.Mike Stewart writes well; the narrative jogs along at a steady clip. But there's really nothing new here. A few scenes work really well, offering an insight into the kind of work Mr. Stewart could produce if he spent less time describing highways and more time on creating characters with depth.It's a quick and easy book to read, but memorable it isn't. There's too much formula, too many almost-stock characters, and too little resolution. Perhaps the next book will show the results of a bit more hard work and some deeper thought."},{"Title":"Dog Island","review":"Mike Stewart, who wrote the incredible &quot;Sins of the Brother&quot;, suffers through his sophomore slump with this newest novel, &quot;Dog Island&quot;. Returning former-attorney Tom McInnes is back dodging bullets and bad guys, even though he insists he's &quot;only an attorney&quot;. It seems that trouble just seems to find him no matter what...which would be to the benefit of everyone's entertainment if only &quot;Dog Island&quot; were as good as the first. The characters felt somehow less vibrant this time around, and didn't bring about the empathy or interest the author was aiming for. With too many predictable twists and turns, Stewart's writing feels as bogged down as the swamplands in which this second effort takes place.Basing this story on the witness of a grisly murder by a teenage runaway, Stewart continues the characterizations he introduced in &quot;Sins of the Brother&quot;, though by mid-story, one hopes that they all meet untimely deaths, or at least decide to move to another state. While confusing multiple identities with plotline, &quot;Dog Island&quot; becomes only repetitive and dreary by the exceptional &quot;seen-it-coming&quot; ending. One would hope that this slump is only temporary, for the promise that &quot;Sins...&quot; showed us says that Stewart is very talented.

For one thing, her parents would never approve of a boy with \\"Skinhead\\" family members.To make matters worse, there's an accident during the party where the kitchen sink totally collapses and he and the Skinheads become prime suspects. In order to fix the sink they decide to organize a concert to raise the money, and Meredith is put in charge.Will she be able to handle the responsibility of putting together a good concert? Will she trust herself enough to be able to sing? And what about \\"Prince\\" Simeon-will she be able to built a stable romantic relationship with him? But how can they when perfect and attentive Matt is always around Meredith like a puppy starved for love, and Simeon himself declares that they shouldn't see each other again, that they're simply two worlds apart and Meredith is better off without him?A story sure to delight young teenagers, Kitchen Sink Concert raises issues with which they'll be able to identify-boyfriend problems, fitting in, self-doubt.

In #8, there are a couple of minor substitution chords in the melody. In #9, there is a secondary dominant followed by a relative minor chord.I still say that Concone, Gurlitt, and Burgmuller are better choices."},{"Title":"Paths of Glory","review":"After seeing the excellent movies from Stanley Kubrick, I decided to read the novel, which it was based upon. Being out of print, it was difficult to locate. But I finally found a copy at a local library. It was worth searching.Paths of Glory was written by Humphrey Cobb and first published in 1935. Cobb, who had served in the Canadian Army during the First World War, wrote this novel as an anti-war statement. In my opinion, it's one of the best. Cobb shows an unpositive view of war. There are no heroes. Not even Regiment Commander Colonel Dax is the courageous man he was in Kubrick's film. He doesn't even have that big of a part.French General Assolant is given orders by his Army Commander (Whose name is not revealed) to take an important German position called the Pimple. To take the \\"Pimple\\", Assolant calls the 181st regiment, which was supposed to be placed on leave.We see the attack beforehand from the eyes of those on the battlefield. A patrol is sent out, where one of the men gets killed by the drunken commander due to a careless accident. The incident is covered up, but would play a part later.The next morning, the eargely anticipated attack on the Pimple is launched. It proves however to be impossible. The 181st is made up of a combination of battle weary vets and fresh new recruits to compensate for losses. Thus, casualties are high. The bombardment from artillery and machine guns also is so difficult to go through that many soldiers never even leave the trenches. Believing the men are mutinying, Assolant orders the battery commander to fire on the men. Fortunately, in what may be the only sensible act in the novel, the man refuses without a written order. Assolant then orders a court martial to preserved his dignity at the expense of others.Four men are selected: One from each of the attacking sections. One section refuses to send a man but the other three select. The men are sent in front of a court-martial with a well-trained lawyer at their side. But it is really more of a Kangaroo Court. This is because the Indictment against the convicted is not read (\\"It basically states the accused are convicted of cowardice\\"), no Stenographic notes are kept of the trial, thus denying the convicted the possibility of a pardon, and the defense is not allowed to build its case. For example, when an attempt is made to call witnesses, it can only be \\"To prove that they made it to the enemy wire\\", which no one of the regiment did. And when the defense attempts to state the decorations one of the men has received (So it can be shown he isn't a coward) the president of the council says \\"The men are on trial for their current cowardice, not their former bravery\\" and that \\"Medals are no defense\\".What is most ludicrous is the line of questioning on the defendants. It is absurd in the way it forces the men to answer irrelevant questions. An example by the President of the council on the convicted Private Ferol:President: Did you advance?Ferol: Yes, Sir.President: How far did you advance?Ferol: To about the middle of no man's land.President: Then what did you do?Ferol: Well, the Boche machine guns were like a hailstorm and I saw that-President: No. Answer my question. What did you do?Ferol: Well, sir, I saw that me and Meyer-President: I didn't ask you what you saw. I asked you what you did.Ferol: Yes, sir.President: Did you advance?Ferol: Not after I saw that me and Meyer-President: Did you turn round and go back?Ferol: Well, when I saw that-President: Attention! Answer my question. Did you turn round and go back? Yes or no?Ferol: Yes, sir.This edition (Paperback, University of Georgia Press, 1987) includes a fascinating afterward by Stephen E. Tabachnick. He mentions about the book's placement of the chain of command and about themes from the book.Sadly, Paths of Glory has become largely underrated over the years. My English teacher hadn't even heard of it. This book should be put back in publishing as soon as possible so more people can experience how great it is and should be recommended reading at schools so people can see how ridiculous war can be."},{"Title":"Paths of Glory","review":"Soldiers have forever obeyed the commands of officers, knowing sometimes that to obey the command was to die and to refuse to obey it was to die. Compound the situation when the officer is acting solely in self-interest, for pride's sake, for the sake of a promotion, for his own ego regardless of the lives of the men he leads. The paths they must follow, the paths of glory, leads but to the grave.This army is French, but it could be any nation's, any year's, any war. Cobb's evocation of pride and prejudice affectinfg the lives of innocent men is scary in that we know it is not over."},{"Title":"Paths of Glory","review":"The other reviews posted here tell the details, but as for a description of the horrors of WWI, this is the book to read. I have no idea why this book has been out of print for decades. It should be heralded more than All Quiet on the Western Front, as it is so much more intense. The descriptions of the shellings, and the description of the battle for the Pimple will leave you stunned. This is one of the best books I have ever read (or re-read several times). This is the one book I have recommended to friends, but never lent for fear of it not being returned. Do not hesitate to purchase this book, since we don't know if it will disappear again soon."},{"Title":"Moment in Peking;: A novel of contemporary Chinese life","review":"This is a very special book.

So, reader, listen to thislittle talk awhile when you have nothing better to do.This novel is neither an apology for contemporaryChinese life nor an expos&eacute; of it, as so many recent Chinese \\"dark curtain\\" novels purport to be. It is neither aglorification of the old way of life nor a defense of thenew. It is merely a story of how men and women in thecontemporary era grow up and learn to live with oneanother, how they love and hate and quarrel and forgiveand suffer and enjoy, how certain habits of living andways of thinking are formed, and how, above all, theyadjust themselves to the circumstances in this earthlylife where men strive but the gods rule."},{"Title":"Moment in Peking;: A novel of contemporary Chinese life","review":"If you want to understand Chinese culture and family traditions, this is definitely an excellent book.

I'd always overlooked Moment in Peking because it was such a big book, but recently, I resolved to pick it up and read it. I stayed up through the night to finish the book, and I think it was completely worth it. I'm a Chinese-American teenager. I live in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, I attend a high school that has only three Chinese students in the entire school. My identity is hyphenated- I am not really Chinese because I am a American Born Chinese. I am not truly American, I am a Chinese American. I have always embraced my culture without really knowing why it's so valuable to me, or how valuable it truly is. Reading Lin Yutang's Moment in Peking gave me a glimpse of how rich my culture and its history is, and helped me understand what it truly means being Chinese. Now I have a deeper love and appreciation for my culture than I ever had before, thanks to Lin Yutang and Moment in Peking.I found Moment in Peking a fascinating read. At times, though, it did feel a little long. Nevertheless, I heartily recommend Moment in Peking to any avid readers of Chinese literature- or anyone at all, for that matter."},{"Title":"Moment in Peking;: A novel of contemporary Chinese life","review":"I have read and re-read this book over the years, along with the following book &quot;A Leaf in the Storm&quot; that continues the story.

It is so easy to read and gives a clear visual of the story, I really can't recommend it enough! Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Moment in Peking;: A novel of contemporary Chinese life","review":"I am a chinese university student. I visited the website by chance and I was so happy to read all the comments about Yutang's books above and got to know not only me, a Chinese girl who loves his books very much, but there are so many people, even foreigners, enjoy them so much like me.I have read some works of Lin, some in English and some in Chinese. And the one I have read recently is Moment in Peking in English. Please believe me that what he said in his book is totally true. And from it you can get an idea of our country, our cultures and people living here, although things have changed so much in the modern times and nowadays China is quite different from the one in his book. But there are still many people,like me, here who bear the same believes, values and dreams as Mulan and Lifu did and want to make the good cultures and moral standards pass down from generation to generation.When I read the book Moment In Peking, I just had the feeling that I was reading something in Chinese.(I wish it had been written in Chinese, since someting must be lost from one language to another. And some of Lin's articles in Chinese read so melodic just like music because of our chinese's swing, while you just cannot find that when it is translated in English.What a pity! ) And I just wondered if a native English was able to understand what he said. Of course, after reading the reviews above, I am sure it is not that so. But still, I think you may get confused at some points. I think perhaps I can explain it for you and help you understand our cultures better. It must be a great pleasure to me. :) And I hope I can talk about his books with people like me, who love them so much as well. :)Thanks for reading:)"},{"Title":"Moment in Peking;: A novel of contemporary Chinese life","review":"I bought my copy in Changsha, Hunan, China and was pleased with my purchase.

She thought it was good but that I might get a better idea from \\"Moment in Peking\\".

Moment in Peking follow the story of a traditional big family with all of their friends and partners, so there are many people in the story and sometimes it is not easy to follow the names. The book describes some interesting decades of the Chinese history: from the second half of the 19th century until the first years of the 20th century. An interesting period of time with a good author gives a good story as a result. The so many actors of the book gives the possibility to show several destinies in a period full of contradictories. I really enjoyed the period of the very end of the 19th century with all the conflicts of the changing lifestyle and the conflict of the traditions and moderns life."},{"Title":"Moment in Peking;: A novel of contemporary Chinese life","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books on understanding Chinese culture and philosophy.

The POW who became a playwright after the war and responsible for the fictionalal, award winning Broadway show and movie named STALAG SEVENTEEN, adds his own story to this book. There is a smooth transition as the story moves back and forth from 1944 to 1996 where now the German and U.S. flags fly side by side, the national anthems are played and the flyers who once tried to kill each other overhead now stand holding hands while hundreds too young to remember, look on and applaud. I liked the epilogue in which the people of the village describe the affect of the war on them, and the biggest event of all; the shooting down of the Flying Fortress named &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot; onto the hillside next to their farms."},{"Title":"Boys at War, Men at Peace: Former Enemy Air Combatants Meet to Remember and Reconcile","review":"My wife and I were fascinated by the author's ability to bring the stories of all the principal characters together, when they assembled for a special ceremony 52 years after the traumatic experiences they endured together. Finding the German pilot, the POW camp leader, the man shot by guards and many others took the combined efforts of German researchers and many Americans. The weaving together of their stories was masterfully done; and surprisingly has led to their reacquaintance and friendship after all these years. We recently read a Ken Follet book in which he fabricated his story and characters, not nearly as astounding and interesting as the &quot;real thing&quot; published in Boys at War, Men at Peace. It should be in libraries and book shops for many years, to be studied by historians of the great air war over Europe, and many previously unpublished incidents in one of the most infamous Stalag Luft camps in Germany. You can put it down, because of the way it is laid out, but you will be anxious to pick it up again to learn what happens next."},{"Title":"Boys at War, Men at Peace: Former Enemy Air Combatants Meet to Remember and Reconcile","review":"I read this book with great interest. Every time I thought I had read something incredible, there was something even more incredible in the very next chapter. The guys who were there are the only ones who know what it was like to be shot while flying a B17 bomber over Europe in WWII, then taken POW by the Germans, and endure the rigors of life as a prisoner. The events that took place are shocking to those of us who, thankfully, have never had to endure such trials.

Kudos, Phaidon, another home-run."},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"This book should be placed on its own table at every home of a designer enthusiast! This book is one of the most beautiful things I have ever bought! :)"},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"First of all, yes, this book is large and heavy by normal standards.Putting those obvious issues aside, I'll focus on its strengths.The Phaidon Atlas is simply the only book of its kind. It packs a lot of recently built, high quality modern architecture into a single volume that is elegantly designed, and actually a lot of fun to view, because of the division of projects into regions of the globe. Anyone who enjoyed flipping through large world atlases at their school library will enjoy this book too, and if you are also a fan of modern architecture, the book is well worth buying.There are many beautifully drawn maps, and useful, intriguing statistics, as any \\"world\\" atlas would feature. A careful reader will see architectural relations of style, approach, materials, etc. unique to regions such as the Netherlands, Israel, China, or Australia. Only a book of such depth can achieve this. Yes, many of the projects are featured elsewhere, but the majority of projects in the book I hadn't seen before, and I'm both a modern architecture enthusiast and an architecture book designer.Speaking of design, the book is gorgeous. I've heard some refer to the layout as boring. I strongly disagree. It is well conceived, with careful placement of all visual elements and text. I find it quite refreshing to be able to view a whole architectural profile on a single spread or a single page. The layouts are done with precision, and an attractive and useful global color-coding scheme is employed throughout.I applaud Phaidon for taking on such an ambitious book project, and for succeeding. The only other publisher of architecture (that I know of) that attempts such large-scale projects is Taschen (see Case Study Houses, Neutra, etc.).To sum up, the Phaidon Atlas may not be for everyone--some will argue about the selection of projects--but for the price, it delivers a lot, in an entertaining and beautifully designed package."},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"I bought this at a local bookstore after spending several hours \\"getting to know\\" it. There are many things about this tome that bear mentioning.Yes, it is immense. Mine came in its own heavy-duty clear plastic \\"briefcase\\" which is amazingly smart. I've been toting it around the house, on vacation, to and from my office because there is so much to get out of this book. And yes, it does a surprisingly good job of describing projects on a page or a half-page. That may be because a half page of this leviathan is similar to 2 pages in a normal book.But what sets this book apart, in my opinion, from other compilations on contemporary work is its organization. Most architecture books I get I read, shelve and only occasionally reference if I remember a particular project that is relevant to me. This book is organized according to region, and each region has a map with locations. There is also a world map showing all the projects. So, for example, if I want to see projects in subtropical regions, I have a simple way of doing that, FAST.Then, each project is given a category with a 3-letter abbreviation (ie REC for recreational, EDU, etc), and there is an index so that if one is interested in looking up only REL religious buildings, BOOM, there you can find excellent examples, globally, from 1998-2003 or so.Then, each project has a cross-listing with other projects by that architect in the book. Another fast way to learn more about an architect whose work strikes you. There's also an index by architects to help you cut to the chase.In short, this book works because the editors must have really thought hard about what would make someone spend up to $160 on a book. In my opinion they succeeded and I plan to give over some generous surface area to this book in my office so that it can be available as a quick reference guide/point of inspiration. That is, once I'm done reading it cover-to-cover in my spare time."},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"this is a beautiful, comprehensive, wonderful book.

As a student of architecture now in my final year I must say that this book has helped me immensly over the past 1.5 yrs. When we are given a new project I go staight to my atlas and the building types index to find numerous buildings I can research as case studies. Even though there is only a half page on most buildings it gives you enough of an idea of whether a project is worth researching in more detail.An excellent reference which has made me aware of many lesser known architects wonderful works.

Only problem is finding a table big enough to read it on!"},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"I bought this book recently (not at amazon)primarily to bring myself up to date on what's out there in the latest trends. I hadn't seen the book, other than the publisher's web site. I was astounded when it arrived at my place of employment to see how much detail on the various projects has been worked into half page arrangements. It's a giant of a book, so the format works. This is one of the finest collections of contemporary architecture I have seen. (I am a practicing architect.)For the price, i believe it to be unique and unrivalled in scope. What especially impressed me was how much work from non-marquee architects was included.I would heartilly recommend this to anyone, in the profession or not, for an in-depth survey of buildings worldwide. I only hope that this is the start of a series and not a one shot deal."},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"It is hard to review or even to critique good books, especially this one. Simply say \\"great\\" or \\"must have\\" does not help potential readers decide whether they need to invest in this volume. I have been struggling as well due to the fact that this book costs money (considering that I am still a poor student) and time (for reading). I was unable to finalize my choice untill this afternoon; and I would like to share my thoughts with all of you.If you are an architecture professional, then the decision is easy to make. Just buy it! Owning this book to you is similar to getting a good dictionary or thesaurus to a professional writer.The hard part comes if you are only a layperson or causal connoisseur to modern architecture (like me). To me, the cons to the investiment is twofold: 1)Information overload and redundancy. The information contained in this book is just massive. Honestly speaking, if you have already read quite a few books about modern architecture, nearly 70-80% of these projects (especially residentail buildings) are similar conceptually. What I (and probably you) need now is thought-provoking ideas and eye-catching images, which pop up among the mediocre. As a reference book, this Atlas includes both the ingenious ones and the boring ones. I have been wondering the necessity of reading all these projects. At least, I don't plan to get a PhD in architecture. 2)Size of the book. This point is peripheral comparing with the above, but still important (at least to me). The book is so large and so heavy that I cannot lie in my sofa or bed, holding and reading it comfortably. I have to get a desk and sit tight and straight. Architecture is my hobby and I really don't want to infuse a research-like mood when reading the book.Fortunately, I picked up another book \\"Architecture Now 3\\" (AN) published by Taschen this afternoon. To me, AN is a concise version of the Phaidon Atlas, and could serve as a good substitute. The projects in AN and Phaidon Atlas overlap a lot. The good thing is that, in general, AN selected those interesting ones from the Atlas, removing all other redundant buildings. So you will still get the cutting-edge trends in today's architecture world with fewer projects and a little bit more detailed text. Plus, AN is organized by architects, so you got the chance to know those people (really useful information for amateurs). Further, AN is much smaller and I can read it anywhere I like (on the patio, in the bed, in a park...).In summary, whether you need to buy this book depends on your needs. Spend money wisely. Hope this helps."},{"Title":"The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture","review":"Comes in a briefcase-style transparent case, which you will definately need to carry this huge tome home (the book measures around 12\\"x18\\" and weighs almost 18 pounds!).

As an architecture student, this is the ultimate sourcebook for modern buildings all over the world, and some of which I've never seen before. The only downside I would say is that there isn't enough technical drawings and it would have been helpful if there were more. However, the book is already huge and I can't imagine how much bigger and heavier it would be if more technical drawings were in there. Besides, now that I know that what the building is called and the architect who designed it, it's easier for me to source out info...Conclusion? No complaints! It's really good as is...

How could one claim to produce an atlas of contemporary world architecture, and yet erase Africa, a continent with a population that rivals China's, and in which therefore architecture surely is being produced? This book has no space for the hundreds of buildings, some as noteworthy as those it presents (in its condensed one building per page format), that were all erected in the last 15 years or so. There is, for example, no space for 21st century Abuja, Nigeria, nor for astounding miracular works at Lekki. It ignores the inspired works of so many South African, Senegalese, Egyptian, Kenyan, Tanzanian, Nigerien (Niamey) and Malagasy architects (to name a few), ....not to mention the work in Africa by European or American architects who found work here because so much of it was going on the profession on the continent has not always been able to absorb it all? I do not count, in this, contemporary architecture in Africa by those who are not architects, and which is more edgy (and at least as original) than most of the works in the volume whose architects are therefore claimed for such a status by the mere fact of selection.A little more honesty would have been welcome. It's either a WORLD atlas, or its not! And, this one, by such a serious omission is far from able to claim a global coverage.

This in my estimate perpetuates a stereotype of modern architecture by default of representative omissions.However even in the developed world of modern architecture where is mention of Rem Koohaas, the Dutch giant of global architecture? Not one word. Another real issue for me with the expense of this book is this total lack of editorial oversight. Notice the samples of architecture in Baja California.

Both are alone and unable to get out for things they need to complete their holiday celebrations but with spunk and ingenuity, they do the best they can. Little do they know that they are only a short dig away from a new friendship.Annamouse and Willamouse are written with warmth and reality so readers will feel like they are in their little dens with them experiencing Christmas Eve. The description of how they would normally go out and sing carols to the rabbits, who Annamouse tells us \\"can't sing at all\\", and to the squirrels who \\"can never remember the words\\" according to Willamouse, creates a world that children will feel right at home in. With her lovingly descriptive language, Corinne Demas writes a clever, humorous tale of a coincidence that brings two mice together for what one can tell will be a long and happy friendship.I adored this book and look forward to a soon-to-be-here first grandchild that I can share it with. In a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" look at the making of this book on Corinne Demas's current website, the idea and first version if this book is explained lovingly and thus allows us to understand even more why this is a beautiful book for children of all ages. Adults can't help but smile at the reference to the favorite composer of the mice, \\"Mouzart\\" or the attention to detail of things like a tray of sushi on the dining table.Corinne writes, \\"I wrote an early version of Two Christmas Mice in 1991 as a Christmas present for my goddaughter, Hadley. I typed out the text, and my six-year-old daughter and I worked on the illustrations together, using colored markers. We made our illustration for the page showing the two mice in their separate-but-nearby holes, just before they discover each other.\\"\\"We made a book by punching holes along the side of the paper and sewing the pages together with red ribbon. Years later, I re-wrote the story, and my agent sent it to Holiday House. Now, fourteen Christmases later, I can give Hadley a present of the published book.\\"So if that doesn't tell you that this is a book that came straight from Corinne Demas' heart, I am not sure what will. Along with the gorgeous illustrations by Stephanie Roth, this makes THE PERFECT holiday gift for all the little ones on your list!"},{"Title":"The story of Dr. Wassell","review":"\\"The Story of Dr. Wassell\\" is a moving account of the trials of a Navy field doctor, Corydon Wassell, during the outbreak of WWII on Java in the South Pacific. James Hilton brings his understated elegant crispness to the narrative which draws you into the complexities of command and responsibility in wartime theatre. Although not a religious man, Dr. Wassell exhibits all the refinements of a decent caring human being on earth, whose decision to serve the needs of his men at all times leads to his acceptance of the Navy Cross. All the dangers of war lurk at any time, yet, Dr. Wassell attends to his wounded wards with incredible zeal that inspires and invigorates those who come under his knowing, intelligent and self-less devotion. I found this to be a very moving and inspiring story, an example of doing what is right without calculation or hesitation. One could sense a larger Hand on his shoulder when he accepted the medal. He was surely an inspiration for Doctors without Borders."},{"Title":"The story of Dr. Wassell","review":"This was a great book. I have a hometown connection to it too. This story is about my friend's Grandfather. His mom tells us how it was to go and visit the movie set when they were kids and they were making the movie about her dad.

I literally didn't put the book down and read it cover to cover."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"\\"Ring for Jeeves\\" was first published in 1953 in the UK, though was first published in the US under the name \\"The Return of Jeeves\\". However, unusually for a Jeeves book, Bertie Wooster is absent. (The Second World War has been and gone, and the effects haven't been good for the aristocracy. The peasants are revolting, and many of the upper classes have actually had to start working for a living. Bertie's back at school, being taught how to fend for himself - just in case the proletariat become even more troublesome. Luckily, it's just a precaution, as his finances remain quite sound. In the meantime. Jeeves is on temporary assignment as the butler of Rowcester Abbey).However, it's a while before either Jeeves or his new employer - Bill Belfry, the ninth Earl of Rowcester - make an appearance. Instead, the book opens at the Goose and Gherkin, where Rosalinda \\"Rosie\\" Spottsworth is taking a break from her journey to the Abbey. Having out-lasted two exceptionally rich husbands, she's now exceptionally rich herself...and Bill's sister, Monica, has nearly convinced her to buy the stately home. (The pair had met in New York, though Bill hasn't quite been informed yet. However, he isn't remotely upset with the news - given that he is a member of the \\"new\\" aristocracy, he is very strapped for cash).Quite by chance, Rosie is soon joined by an old friend - Captain Biggar, the legendary big-game hunter. (Mr Spottsworth had been on a hunting expedition with the Captain when Rosie went from being Mrs Spottsworth to the Widow Spottsworth). Although more used to chasing down lions and rhinos, the Captain is again on the hunt - having backed an unlikely double at Epsom, he was due to collect about 3000 from his bookie. Unfortunately, the bookie in question - Honest Patch Perkins - and his clerk ran off without paying up. All the same, Biggar he knows he's on the right track - although his car has broken down, he's tailed them this far...and it's only a matter of time before he picks up the scent again. Unfortunately, Honest Patch Perkins is really a thinly-disguised (and totally broke) Bill...while his clerk was none other than Jeeves.Naturally, there are also major problems for the characters' romances. Biggar and the Widow Spottsworth have their sights set on one another, but the Great Hunter is being badly hampered by his code of honour. (He won't feel worthy of the Rosie until he has a fortune of his own...which makes him even more determined to get his hands on his winnings). In a typically Wodehousian twist, things are further complicated by Rosie's previous form with Bill - the pair had, briefly, taken moonlit strolls along the seafront in Cannes. (She was between husbands at the time). Poor Bill has to lay it on thick with Rosie, in an attempt to smooth the sale of the Abbey...which causes his fianc&eacute;e, Jill, no end of anguish and sparks waves of jealousy and contempt from Biggar. Jeeves' difficulties are compounded by Monica's husband, Rory Carmoyle - the sort of character you can rely on to say the worst possible thing, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, to the worst possible person.A little strange, for a Jeeves book - I'm used to Bertie telling the story, getting everything wrong and then being used as the book's fall guy. Jeeves plays a smaller role than normal too, though - luckily - his superior mental powers remain impressive. Still, an enjoyable and funny book overall...you can always rely on Plum."},{"Title":"Cats in May","review":"Doreen Tovey is a woman who knows how to get her own back.

All I can say about this book is WOW! I had never even heard of Gene Edwards before I stumbled across some of his books on Amazon and asked for some of them for Christmas. This guy is the real deal! My soul absolutely delighted in reading Mr. Edwards account of the Church from Christ's resurrection up until just after the founding of the Antioch church (47 AD).Edwards details exactly the historical atmosphere of the early church in Jerusalem, Judea, and into the Gentile world. This book REALLY makes the book of Acts come alive for me. Edwards is so utterly amazing in his extrapolation of truth out of God's word!Even though one reviewer said he did not like Edwards' interjections of comparison between the early church and the church today, I found them stunning and extremely insightful! I am a relatively new believer and my favorite part of this book is how he shows how all of the apostles and early church fathers (EVEN CHRIST HIMSELF) all had a period of &quot;wasted&quot; time in their life when they were becoming rooted in God. Edwards' point is to show that today's church is so worried about soul-winning that most do not even really know the Lord and do not really know the Holy Spirit because they have not spent this time of seeking God. Edwards shows that it took most of the original church founders at least 8 years of tutorage under the Apostles to become rooted in God and Christ. It can be assumed that even Christ himself underwent this period of time prior to his ministry! I thought that was a sweet point!Would I buy this book with my own money? YES! I can almost guarantee that the Holy Spirit will move powerfully within you while you read this book! This book is phenomenal! Peace. ~ajm"},{"Title":"Revolution: The Story of the Early Church","review":"Revolution: the Story of the Early Church was the first book ever written that fully recounts the development of the first churches. This book tells the story of how the first \\"churches\\" ever came to be, the first real persecution that the church as a whole ever had to suffer, and how churches came to be all over the earth. This story recounts the first seventeen years of the early churches from 37-40 a.d.Everything began around Passover, 5 weeks after Christ's crucifixion. The Apostles and about 150 believers had gathered in Jerusalem where they fasted and prayed, waiting for the Lord to come to them and tell them what He desired them to do. Christ came to them. His spirit filled them. So mighty was He that everyone in Jerusalem was shaken and new that something miraculous, something glorious had just happened. The apostles went to the people and began to teach them about the wondrous thing which had just happened to them and the people were so interested that the apostles began to proclaim the message of Christ to all of them. Convicted and overjoyed at the message they were hearing the people sold everything they had, left their homes in other cities and moved to Jerusalem. The first church was then born.There were over 3,000 believers sharing houses or living on the streets of Jerusalem. These people learned to live together just like a family, only with 3,000 members. They ran into small difficulties, but never anything to big to be handled. How can this be? Well, because all of those 3,000 people loved their neighbor better than themselves. They were all ready to give up their own comfort for someone else's.It astounds me that this is how the first church ever was. When reading about the joy that they had and the struggles that they overcame, I wished so badly that the churches today would do this. How many people really care about the rest of the congregation in their church? How many people are actually totally committed to following Christ, so committed in fact, that they would die just so they could be with their Lord? The answer: very few. The answer for the amount of people in America: even fewer.This book is convicting, especially when you read about the persecution and the joy that Christ gave these people. But what I like most is that there is joy in the work of the Lord. If we could at least be joyful for what we have been given, for the history of our people, we would be doing a lot better than we are now.I think that this is a good book for people to read. I don't know if it will convict people or give them better ideas for their church or even their families. No matter what response people get out of this book, I believe that everyone should read it just so they understand their heritage.

Gene has a gift of documenting history in a story fomat. Every sincere regenerated believer should have this understanding of God's design for His church. His intent was never the Babylonian picture we have today. Today's \\"church\\" is patterened after the world.

He presents the challenges that faced the church, and introduces us to men like Stephen, Phillip and Barnabas. Unfortunately, the narrative is frequently interrupted by Mr. Edward's comparisons of the early church to the present-day church. While I feel there is merit to Mr. Edwards criticisms of the church today (though some of his complaints are simply anachronisms) the constant interruptions really damage the flow of the story.Overall, I think this book is worth reading, but I think that some of Mr. Edwards other books (e.g. The Silas Diaries) are better."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Without a doubt, this is one of the most riveting mountaineering books around. Not for the climbing, which is in and of itself gripping, but for the slice of human drama found in the deterioration of relationships amongst various members of the expedition. At times, one is mesmerized by the bad behavior displayed at such high altitudes! One would think that these expeditioners were on Melrose Place, rather than fighting for their place in mountaineering history on K2, one of the most perilous mountains in the world to ascend.Central to all the squabbling, was the love trangle which developed on the expedition, which was perceived by some of the expeditioners to be an extra marital affair in progress. Though this later proved to be true, at the time it was the source of much denial and hard feelings. It further split the team, which was already divided over who would be chosen to summit, and eroded already existing friendships, while preventing new ones which might have otherwise developed.On top of all this, add in poor weather which caused them to spend about sixty seven days on the mountain, mostly at altitudes over eighteen thousand feet, and you have a recipe for disaster. These expeditioners, however, managed to become the first Americans to ascend K2.Their success in achieving their objective, despite the trials and tribulations which they endured, is testament to their fortitude in putting aside petty, mean spirited concerns and inter-personal conflicts. This painstaking account of the first time summit of K2 by Americans is a must read for all climbing enthusiasts and readers of this genre."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Ridgeway describes the epic story of the first successful American climb of K2 in 1978. K2, the second highest mountain in the world, has always presented unique challenges due in part to its remote location and in part to its degree of difficulty.There are two fascinating aspects to this climb that are explored in great detail. The first key sub-plot tells the story of the organizational and personal issues that emerged as the expedition dragged on week after week. The schism that developed between the four aggressive climbers (Ridgeway, Reichardt, Wickwire, and Roskelley) and the other climbers demonstrates the pressures that can grow within any small group of people, friends or not, when they are subjected to incredible physical demands, differences of opinions, and the need to wait out the inevitable storms. With some of the challenges they faced, it is remarkable that the entire team continued to carry loads up the mountain day after day and that they were ultimately successful in putting four climbers at the top.The second sub-story describes the route selection process by the lead climbers at the top of the mountain. They were exploring a new route in difficult conditions. Ultimately, this culminates in the decision, whether forced by equipment failure or by choice, by three of the four climbers to make for the top of K2 without the use of supplemental oxygen - a feat that had never been completed before. At the same time, the almost hallucinatory description of Wickwire's emergency bivouac at 28,000 feet is a compelling story of his determination to survive.This book is a great read for those interested in the history of mountain climbing."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This terrific climbing book combines the larger stories of a struggle to climb the &quot;world's hardest mountain,&quot; K2, with a smaller soap opera about a very diverse group of people trying to acheive a goal without driving each other crazy.From a distance, one might see a cohesive group of climbers, pulling together through the interminable months-long task of hauling supplies and tents up through a series of ever-higher camps, one step up, and then two steps down. But closer up, Ridgeway describes in fascinating detail, how the expedition dissolved into competing cliques, and how selfishness and teamwork collided. There's even an extra-marital love triangle.While this book is not as much of a page-turner as Into Thin Air, it is one of the finest mountaineering books out there; a must read in this genre."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This book really did break the mold concerning how expedition account books were written, although some would put that label on Galen Rowell's account of the previous American K2 expedition: In The Throne Room of the Mountain Gods. Prior to In The Throne Room and The Last Step, the interpersonal aspects of expedition life were typically kept private in the books, in the British tradition. In The Throne Room exposed the rifts between team members on that expedition, but not in the compelling manner which Rick Ridgeway pulled it off in The Last Step. It's amazing that the team managed to summit 4 members given the difficult route chosen, the horrid weather and the altitude, let alone the infighting. Then again, Wickwire, Reichart, Roskelly and Ridgeway were not the types of climbers to back down easily. One has to wonder how much correlation there was between the infighting and the stubborness of the leading climbers."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"I had intended to stretch the reading of this over a couple of weekends. Instead I read it in two sittings. I literally could not put it down! I especially liked the author's account of his experience in the \\"death zone\\" while making his successful assault on one of the more difficult peaks in the Himalaya - without supplemental oxygen! I had always thought I would like to climb in the Himalaya. After reading the part about Wickwire's bivouac near 28,000 feet, I think I will be satisfied just reading about it. I highly recommend this excellent book!"},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"In spite of all the fighting and split factions, this expedition was able to successfully place 4 men on the summit of K2 in 1978. Ridgeway is a compelling writer, who is able to retain reader interest and develop his characters well. He effectively gave me insight into the different personalities of the climbers. It was interesting to read about all the dissentions and miscommunications, plus get the exciting climbing experiences of the two separate summit parties. Ridgeway's description of his summit day experience made me feel like I was actually there feeling the bitter cold, and trying to suck down enough oxygen to breathe. I doubt there would have been a successful summit ascent if the 4 who made the summit hadn't been their persistent, focused selves.I have decided that any moutaineering story that includes climber John Roskelley will undoubtedly have some sort of controversy, as he likes to air his opinions, telling it like it is. He wrote \\"Nanda Devi,\\" which is another interesting mountaineering adventure that includes drama and controversy as well. I recommend it in addition to \\"The Last Step.\\"I have started to read Cherie Bremer-Kamp's (known to the '78 K2 American expedition as Cherie Bech) book, \\"Living on the Edge\\" to try to understand her character and motivations a little better. She was one of the controversial members of the '78 expedition. Even after reading her perspective of the K2 expedition and her relationship with Chris Chandler, I still can't help but wonder at the insensitivity and disrespect she showed to her husband (and the father of her two children) who was climbing on the same expedition! Especially after the vehement denials on her part! There are always two sides to a story, I guess.Read this book, you won't be disappointed. It's got it all, drama and climbing adventure."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"The most amazing thing about this book is the sense of being there it creates for the reader. If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to be on a high-altitude expedition, this is the book. I've read a number of other mountaineering books, but this one stands out in putting the reader in the action. Aside from that, the book is also an inspiring story of heroes who knew what they wanted and were willing to do whatever it took to get it."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"The dangers of mountaineering: not only the mountain, but one's fellow climbers.

High drama, with insights into the terrible physical and psychological dangers of mountaineering and the price that must be paid to climb possibly the most difficult mountain in the world. The excellent writing by Rick Ridgeway weaves the interrelationships of climbers with each other, the mountain, and the eventual sacrfices to be the first American team to reach the summit of K2. If you love adventure; want a better understanding of alpine mountaineering; or to see why K2 is probably the most formidable of the great mountains...read this one!"},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This expedition of the first Americans (and third group) to summit K2 took place in 1978--which for me doesn't seem like ancient history. But while the equipment was relatively modern, communication was archaic by today's standards. No GPS, no satellite phones, no internet uplinks--the wife of one climber learns of his fate by telegram! Also, because this was Pakistan and not Nepal, there were no Sherpas and only a very small number of high altitude porters and none in the final stages.So these guys (and gals--it really wasn't ancient history) did it the old-fashioned way--they trekked in for many days to reach Base Camp, they fixed their own rope and carried all their own equipment and cooked their own food. No team of Sherpas to set up aluminum ladders and make sure everyone gets across them. These folks write letters home and listen to cassette tapes.And yet the story is told with the frankness of modern times--how do you pee at 27,000 feet, how do you deal with adultery on the expedition, and is it really worth it to climb mountains like this, risking death and the possibility of leaving your kids orphaned?Extremely up-close and vivid writing, step by step and ragged breath by ragged breath. I read this on a hot summer day and yet the feeling of frostbite seemed more real than the hot air around me. A captivating story told by a skilled climber who is also a gifted writer."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Ok, as mountaineering literature goes. A good deal of suspense on if they are going to get to the top. Ridgeway is able to take an objective view of the events and interpersonal relationships even though he was in the thick of it all."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"I've spent the past couple of weeks reading a lot of mountaineering books, including the incredible \\"High\\" and \\"Epic\\" collections. This book was more interesting from a sociological perspective than an historical one. It should have been titled, \\"The Me Generation Climbs a Mountain and Lives (Somehow) to Tell About It.\\"There is some detail about the actual climb and route(s) chosen, but most of the book is about interpersonal relationships and navel gazing on the part of the author/narrator as well as those who contributed to the book. If this team had been climbing during the 50's, the rest of the mountaineers would have thrown them off a cliff after a week. If they'd been climbing with Messner, he'd have thrown each of them off a cliff. Without oxygen. After the first day. The whining! The arguments! The touchy-feely \\"we cleared the air and now everything'll be great!\\" attitude.No, really, the previous generation was wiser: keep your feelings to yourself and stifle, stifle, stifle, all the way to the top, because when you have to live with people under very stressful conditions for a long time, even small things get magnified into major issues; and this group started out with HUGE things.Some of the attitudes displayed were also condescending. The author thinks little of the Japanese conquest of K2, and makes a snide remark early on about how he has no doubt they will find lots of Japanese trash on the mountain left over from the huge Japanese expedition. As the book wends on, oddly enough, he finds loads of Polish trash and rope left, even excavating what he terms a \\"garbage dump.\\" But the only Japanese trash he finds on the mountain is a soup wrapper! I don't think, in all his navel-gazing, he realised how disrespectful and denigrating he came across, because I'm sure he'd have beaten his breast over that too.The epilogue was very satisfying: after the temper tantrum thrown by one of the climbers, it was interesting to read about karmic retribution, if you will. But I'd pick up Ed Hillary's book to reread (again) before I'd read this book again. Edmund Hillary actually seems to enjoy climbing mountains, and is able to convey the wonder and excitement he felt climbing even \\"small\\" peaks in the Himalayas.PS: My husband points out that the book has a magnificent collection of photographs. This is very true."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Pakistan's magnificent K2 is known also as \\"The savage mountain.\\" At 28,250 feet it is second only to Everest in height but first in difficulty to climb, endowed with the worst weather in the Himalaya. Five times, American mountaineers had tried to climb this mountain, and failed. Five men had died in these attempts.This is the story of the year that the Americans took care of their unfinished business. In 1978, under the leadership of Everest-veteran Jim Whittaker (himself trying K2 for the second time), fourteen men and women set out with a common goal: to work together to get somebody--anybody--to the top of K2.It is said about K2 that if you do not take the mountain in 45 days, you will not take it at all. The Americans spent 67 days on K2 in 1978, nearly all above 18,000 feet, where the stresses of high-altitude living, of monotonous food, of confinement in tiny tents for day after day of frustrating storms ultimately give the mountain the last word.This is the story of how people, each day left more naked before themselves and before the mountain, overcame their individual fears, desires and disappointments to achieve a victory in which all could share. After four decades of failure, four Americans--Jim Wickwire, Lou Reichardt, Rick Ridgeway and John Roskelley--finally stood atop K2. Wickwire so savored the victory that he lingered too long and was forced to bivouac just below the summit, without food, oxygen or shelter in -40 degree temperatures and winds over 50 mph. His will to survive kept the mountain from claiming yet another life, but when the four came down, their emaciated physical condition told, more graphically than words, the cost of climbing \\"the savage mountain.\\""},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This was the first mountaineering book I had ever read, and it is still one of the best. First of all, it is just a great book if you enjoy mountaineering and adventure. This book has something that most mountaineering books don't... a storyline on top of all the info on climbing and K2. As we read we start feeling the strains and upsets that fellow climbers in the expedition have caused (by taking rest days on perfect weather, not listening to the leader.. ect...) As you read you start to feel like you are there, and what a great feeling that is! The story ends with sucess (hence the title) and an impressive feat by Jim Wickwire, when he comes within inches of death! I recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure, you will surely enjoy it."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. It very vividly recreates the camraderie, the fatigue, the infighting, and the sheer passion that are a part of such an expedition. The best chapter perfectly describes the author and a colleague projecting hundred foot shadows on the terrain thousands of feet below as the afternoon sun sets behind the ridge which they are ascending, conveying so unmistakably to the reader why people climb these mountains. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"I am a personal friend and former business partner of one of the four climbers on this expedition to reach the summit of K2. I was particularly interested in learning about the relationships and conflicts among the members of this expedition. Ridgeway did not \\"hold back\\" on his comments relating to the egos and personal objectives of these climbers. I thought that Wickwire was very fortunate that he did not die near the summit due, in large part, due to his carelessness that resulted from his anxiousness to reach the summit,"},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"\\"The Last Step: The American Ascent of K2\\" is Rick Ridgeway's extremely well written account of the first successful American ascent (and only third overall ascent at the time) of the world's second highest peak. \\"The Last Step\\" is the \\"expedition account\\" and includes fascinating commentary from several climbers, making for a more rounded view than most climbing books. \\"The Last Step\\" is blessed with a stunning collection of photographs which provide a sense of scale both of the beauty of the Karakoram Mountains and of the incredibly difficult terrain the expedition overcame.Ridgeway's account candidly describes the tensions and acrimony that built up in the expedition as it was repeatedly stalled by poor weather in the fall of 1978. The expedition spent 67 days on the mountain, much of it exposed to the debilitating effects of high altitude. The normally driven and competitive natures of good climbers became points of friction as the expedition faced oncoming winter and the likelihood that few if any of the climbers were going to get a shot at the summit.Ridgeway's narrative of the two successful summit attempts is absolutely hair-raising, as men too long in the \\"dead zone\\" above 26,000 feet climbed like near-zombies over dangerously exposed snow slopes. One climber, Jim Wickwire, was forced to bivouac overnight in sub-zero temperatures at 28,000 feet after zoning out and lingering too long at the summit.The account makes clear that only the most fit, capable, and single-minded climbers had any chance of topping out on K2 under the conditions faced in 1978. Those climbers with lesser skills or with distractions such as homesickness or as in one case, an affair with another member of the team, were unable or unwilling to risk all for the summit.This book is most highly recommended to fans of the climbing account genre. Although a long read at over 300 pages, others may find it of interest as an indepth look at what happens on world-class climbing expeditions."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This is a good read, well written, and I agree with the 4-5 star reviews here so I'll keep it short. Too much time is spent on the personal conflicts between the climbers, it seems like that's half the book at times, and even though that got tiring, it's still a very hard to put down book. There are plenty of beautiful photographs which portray the difficulty of the mountain."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Great book so far, only 2 chapters in. Excellent writing takes you right to the heart of the trip. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"This is a riveting mountaineering adventure, couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the images included in this book. Great read!"},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"First the short version: Written by Rick Ridgeway (one of the summiters), this is a detailed, well-written account of the hardships, team conflicts and eventual triumph (though almost at the cost of their lives) of the 1978 American K2 expedition; with the best color photos of the mountain, the climbers and the stages of the route taken I've seen in any of the K2 books I've read so far.The longer version:Not too long ago I became fascinated with K2 with all of its contradictions: beautiful but malevolent, awe inspiring yet soul- and body-destroying to so many mountaineers who seem to be magnetically drawn to it again and again.I've bought several other books on K2 and various expeditions there. This book is probably the best single account of one attempt, the 1978 American K2 Expedition. Attempting a new route, the climbers' battle at times seems unendurable- brutal ice and snow storms with sub-zero temperatures, climbing through near-vertical snow fields that can avalanche at any moment, ice walls, constant rock slides and ever-thinning air making each task increasingly exhausting as their bodies and minds slowly but inevitably deteriorate.Throughout this, the team is increasingly divided by jealousy, conflicting egos and mistrust as the time to determine the chosen few for the summit bid grows closer. The struggle of willpower and human frailty that accompany and burden each person as the climb gets harder and harder come through very clearly. By the time the last four able to endure have gotten within reach of the summit, I felt like I was there too--crawling seemingly on the very edge of space, motivated only by the will not to stop.Accompanying the well-written account are incredible photos of the mountain, showing tents pitched on tiny shelves carved from precipitous, knife-edged ridges; steep, seemingly neverending climbs with the summit always looking so near but still thousands of feet above; and some amazing shots of the final summit climb as the sun sets over the edge of the world.I've given away most of the others but this is one I'll keep. At full-price brand new, this book is well worth it-at less, you can't lose."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Without a doubt, this is one of the most riveting mountaineering books around. Not for the climbing, which is in and of itself gripping, but for the slice of human drama found in the deterioration of relationships amongst various members of the expedition. At times, one is mesmerized by the bad behavior displayed at such high altitudes! One would think that these expeditioners were on Melrose Place, rather than fighting for their place in mountaineering history on K2, one of the most perilous mountains in the world to ascend.Central to all the squabbling, was the love trangle which developed on the expedition, which was perceived by some of the expeditioners to be an extra marital affair in progress. Though this later proved to be true, at the time it was the source of much denial and hard feelings. It further split the team, which was already divided over who would be chosen to summit, and eroded already existing friendships, while preventing new ones which might have otherwise developed.On top of all this, add in poor weather which caused them to spend about sixty seven days on the mountain, mostly at altitudes over eighteen thousand feet, and you have a recipe for disaster. These expeditioners, however, managed to become the first Americans to ascend K2.Their success in achieving their objective, despite the trials and tribulations which they endured, is testament to their fortitude in putting aside petty, mean spirited concerns and inter-personal conflicts. This painstaking account of the first time summit of K2 by Americans is a must read for all climbing enthusiasts and readers of this genre."},{"Title":"Last Step: The American Ascent of K2","review":"Outstanding account of the expedition. May be a bit too detailed for some, but it definitely picks up as it goes. It's unusual to see this much detail on personal interactions.

All in all, this book is VERY WELL written, full of interesting problems and I WARMLY recommend it to anyone interested in mathematical competitions, or just in solving nice problems."},{"Title":"Mathematical Olympiads 2000-2001","review":"This is a great book for problem solving, whether you are a participant, or a trainer (read tutor, but for former participants, we prefer trainer). Anyway, it is a great collection of problems and solutions.OK! I am about twelve years overdue for math contests, but I enjoyed them way too much, and now, my little brothers are getting to the right age, so, I have bought some literature. This book is part of it, and an important part in that regard.I just would love it to be a bit cheaper. I mean, it doesn't hurt, for me, a college professor, to spend a Benjamin in three books for math olympiads, but when I was sixteen and participating on contests, I wouldn't have been able to afford it."},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"At War at Sea is worth five stars simply because Spector pays so much attention to the human element of naval warfare over the past century. His accounts of how the major navies trained both officers and enlisted men, what life was actually like at sea during war, and how the various navies were able to adapt to changes in weapons and technology is quite fascinating. No, this isn't another in-depth account of the major naval battles of the century (he barely mentions Pearl Harbor), but that isn't his intent, as he makes clear from the beginning. But if you're interested in what life at sea was really like, this is a good place to start.Spector clearly has a deep understanding of the technology of naval warfare, but he's no Tom Clancy, bedazzled by the hardware. His principal interest is how the navies adapted (or quite often failed to adapt) to rapid changes in fighting machines, and how the training the men received and the relationships between officers and enlisted ranks affected how they were able to put new technology to use.I found the book to be very evenhanded overall, and I thought the sections on the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Royal Navy were fascinating. The post-WW2 section was a bit too exclusively focused on the US Navy - a deeper look at the Soviet Navy would have been useful, and in keeping with the earlier sections. Two other caveats: not enough maps (a generic flaw in recent history books, it seems), and godawful editing and proofreading in the later chapters. Major publishing houses no longer seem to be able to afford spellchecking programs, let alone proofreaders."},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"The author, Ronald Spector, former Marine and director of naval history for the US Navy, is professor of history and international relations at George Washington University and respected author of naval history. Spector does not cover the spectrum of battles in the 20th century. Rather, he analyzes selective campaigns and battles that he believes illustrate the evolution of naval warfare from ships of sail to modern weapons of mass destruction. He uses well-documented contemporaneous letters and personal journals, as well as records of subsequent interviews of the participants, to provide an insightful description from the perspective of those who fought the battles. John Keegan pioneered this perspective of examining warfare in The Face of Battle (1976). The result is an interesting presentation of how sociological factors, combined with decisions and technological developments shaped naval history.Spector begins with the 1905 Battle of Tsushima, regarded as the Trafalgar of the 20th century (or Russia's Pearl Harbor), which resulted in Japan emerging as an important military power that could and, ultimately, did threaten the West. He analyzes how the navies of the two unlikely protagonists --Japan and Russia -- adapted to advancements in weapons and technology and presents a compelling view of what life was like for a \\"fighting sailor.\\"Spector next analyzes The Battle of Jutland, which was \\"the largest naval engagement of World War I and the greatest clash of battleships in history.\\" Though out-numbered 30:1,6,000 British died, compared to 2,500 Germans, presenting a new horror.\\"In a single afternoon, the British had lost more seamen than were killed in action in the twenty years of war against Napoleon.\\" (pg. 100)***\\"The modern naval battle is different from everything else in the world.... And a single stroke of a single weapon might wipe out a thousand lives. Not for another three decades would land warfare attain this level of destructiveness....\\"(ibid.)Superior German technology is often cited for British defeat. Spector, however, argues that the different technologies canceled each other, and that it was the human factor -- the individual sailor -- that determined the outcome.The book takes the reader through Vietnam and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Evolution in technology and tactics are discussed, but special emphasis is placed on the observations of the average sailor during each battle.A major fault of the book is the failure to cover, adequately, the last 25 years of the 20th century. The detailed examination of battles essentially ends with the Vietnam War. This is unfortunate since a variety of new weapons system and tactics were employed after Vietnam. Curiously, there is no coverage at all of Operation Desert Storm where the importance of widespread employment of tactical cruise missiles emerged.The book is very easy to read and can be appreciated by the general public. The anecdotal passages make the book more enjoyable and present a moving and unsettling account of war in the 20th century. Curiously, the book is not well edited and does not appear to have been proofread, especially towards the end.I recommend the book up through the close of the Vietnam War, but not for its coverage of subsequent battles."},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"At War at Sea covers both the main naval engagements of the 20th century which are generally familiar to most naval history readers as well as the minor ones which the author feels had a significant impact on naval history of the period.For instance, he explains the changeover from battleship dominance to submarine and carrier dominance in naval warfare but brings in the earliest instances where both submarines and carriers were perceived to be effective; not just the better known instances where the shift in effect was recognized by many.The coverage of large battle situations is generally superficial but he writes in some length about the buildup and background to these well known naval events. A number of his miscellaneous anecdotes have not normally been made known in many of the more familiar historys of major naval events and thus are interesting to the reader.A good half of the book concentrates on the background and reasons for significant changes in naval operations, procedures, etc.. This brings in the &quot;depth&quot; or analysis in the writing. Of particular interest is how the author looks at the way naval personnel procedures and attitudes come into play with the changes in strategy.All in all, a good review of the naval century for the more serious naval history reader."},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"The author takes an interesting approach to describing the evolution of naval warfare during the twentieth century. He describes the development of technologies in conjunction with the training and treatment of the men in different navies at different times and shows the ramifications in selected battles. One aspect that make this book particularly interesting is that the author discusses the inner machinations of the Tsarist, WWI German and British, WWII Japanese, and post-WWII Soviet navies; material that has not been comprehensively and collectively covered in other books. Another aspect is the author's selection of the battles to show how naval warfare occurred in practice. Instead of focusing only on the battles that were strategic turning points, the author uses examples that show the problems of changing technology and organization presented to navies and the adjustments that were made. For example, the rapid evolution of aviation in naval warfare during WWII is shown in the battles of Crete, Santa Cruz (Solomon Islands), the Mariannas, and Okinawa. The book does not purport to be an extensive documentary of naval history but rather shows how and why it changed. It is particularly recommended for readers who want a better understanding of the practical effects of the human element in naval warfare."},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"First off, this is neither a comprehensive history of twentieth century naval warfare nor an oral history. The book aims to describe the evolution of world navies from ships of sail to modern high-tech platforms and the technological and social revolutions that fueled this evolution. At that level, this work is fundamentally successful, though sometimes tedious.The book's ultimate failure is in the extremely cursory coverage given the last twenty-five years of the twentieth century. All meaningful coverage of naval warfare ceases at the close of the Vietnam War. Oddly, the most detail given after that relates several naval skirmishes between Israel and her Syrian and Egyption foes in the Yom Kippur War. The only other detailed coverage of US naval operations concerns the USS Vincennes tragic shoot-down of an Iranian passenger jet at the tail-end of the Iran-Iraq war, though Mr. Spector does go to some length to describe the mitigating factors which led to that tragedy.The Falklands War is given relatively light coverage, considering that it constituted an important proving ground for a variety of modern naval tactics and weapons systems. Similarly, no coverage at all is given the several engagements between US and Libyan forces in the 1980s, despite the fact that this constituted the first use of the Harpoon antiship missile in combat. Likewise, Operation Earnest Will, in which US naval vessels escorted reflagged Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran-Iraq War is also given slim coverage. The attack on the USS Stark is never mentioned and the damage control lessons learned in that incident and in the USS Samuel B. Roberts attack is completely ignored, despite the fact that those two incidents brought about radical changes in both shipboard firefighting tactics and equipment. No mention is made of the close interservice cooperation in this operation, nor the use of US Army Special Forces operating from US Navy ships in an naval interdiction role.Operation Desert Storm is totally neglected, despite the first wide-scale employment of tactical cruise missiles and their importance in the war. No mention is made of the use or importance of Navy and Marine Corps aircraft in attack roles in Operation Desert Storm, nor the damage to a US cruiser and amphibious ship by Iraqi mines.If you want a reasonable assessment of the causes and effects of the evolution of the navy through Vietnam, this book is adequate. If you want an assessment of the modern navy, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"Winston Churchill once said he read only for pleasure or profit. Professor Spector's &quot;War at Sea&quot; can be read for both, and more. It can be read straight through, from start to finish, with pleasure and profit, but it can also be picked up and, with some sorting out, read piecemeal, one era or conflict at a time. The work would serve admirably as a text in an upper division college course on the history of sea power and navies, and it would also serve well as a foundation for naval planners looking to the future. What sets &quot;War at Sea&quot; apart from other books that survey naval conflict is the author's attention to the sociological forces at work in shaping navies and their effect on the results produced by those navies. He is able to do so without ever lapsing into the psychobabble preferred by sociologists and psychologists, which contributes greatly to the pleasure to be drawn from the book.Two very minor annoyances need mentioning: &quot;War at Sea&quot; was carelessly proofread, with the result that typographical errors occasionally bring the reader up short. The other is more disconcerting. For reasons known only to himself, Professor Spector has inverted the names of Japanese personalities, and because Japan was not only a major 20th Century naval power but was involved in three major 20th Century wars, much attention is paid to that nation.Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto becomes Admiral Yamamoto Isoruku, in Spector's work, and Admiral Chuichi Nagamo becomes Admiral Nagumo Chuichi, and so on. Morison didn't do this in his 15-volume &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II.&quot; Karig, et al, didn't do it in their &quot;Battle Report,&quot; a four-volume history of that war produced under the direction of wartime Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. Potter didn't do it in his biographies of Chester W. Nimitz, Arleigh Burke and William F. Halsey. The Wall Street Journal doesn't do it in its coverage of Japanese business.Spector is alone in this aberration, and for the reader who is already comfortable with the conventional presentation of Japanese names, it is a bother.But not enough of a bother to dim the pleasure or dilute the profit to be gained by reading &quot;War at Sea.&quot;"},{"Title":"At War at Sea: Sailors and Naval Combat in the Twentieth Century","review":"The author, Ronald Spector, former Marine and director of naval history for the US Navy, is professor of history and international relations at George Washington University and respected author of naval history.

Good condition, prompt delivery."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"Many beginners in GR don't have a rudimentary intuitive understanding of what 4-vectors are and how to use them in a simple physical problem. This textbook helps with that - it gives you a workout in using 4-vectors and thinking geometrically about spacetime. It teaches you the basic notions of metric, embedding diagrams, hypersurfaces, observers carrying their orthonormal bases and performing measurements, geodesics, coordinate transformations, curvature and energy tensors. Along the way, it manages to explore in detail the three most important metrics in GR: black holes (static and rotating), cosmological models of the universe and gravitational radiation. The book covers the conceptual foundations (how Einstein developed the idea), the mathematical machinery, the analysis of the historical confirmations of GR as well as many contemporary observations like gravitational lensing, cosmic background radiation, or acceleration of the universe expansion (by the way the cosmological chapters are the most logical introduction to cosmology I've seen), even future experiments like gravity probe B that is going to measure the 'frame dragging' around Earth.In the first 400 pages the book is exploring different metrics by calculating physical observable quantities like redshift, orbits, bending of light and so on using 4-vectors only. There are many examples that show you actual calculations right after a new concept is introduced and help you learn thinking in terms of 4-vectors. The usual tensor analysis, curvature, covariant derivative and Einstein equation are introduced in the last 100 pages. Each chapter has about 20 problems on average, ranging from very easy ones that familiarize you with the new concepts, average ones that train you to combine several concepts from the text, and quite hard ones (marked with [C]) that require a lot of creativity, guessing and effort on your part (sometimes you can't solve them but don't cry :). I've solved about 90% of the problems - unfortunately there aren't any answers ... Your calculus must be in prime shape, you have to know what differential is, you often have to solve integrals (for the time consuming ones use Mathematica), differential equations (only simple ones), approximate terms in formulas 'up to first order' in something and frequently convert between SI units and geometrized units (c = G = 1) but nothing fancier than that is required. The book has a web site[...]with supplements (some more theoretical derivations, nothing scary) and downloadable Mathematica notebooks that calculate Christoffels and curvature for any metric you fill in (believe me they save you a LOT of algebra).If you can spend about 6 hours per day, you can read the text and solve most of the problems in about 4 months. The text gave me many answers but often made me ask deeper questions whose answers I have to find on my own. I would say the presentation is 3/4 very clear and 1/4 is kind of fuzzy and could be improved by the author - it 'makes sense' when you read it but when you start solving the problems it turns out there are important details missing - I usually resolve these but it would be less time consuming if the text was more systematic. Solving the problems makes you really understand the concepts and is more valuable than reading the text alone! It is amazing how the book cuts through stuff that sounds 'too sophisticated' and after a few days you understand it and can even calculate it.Lastly, this text covers the beginning level of GR. You will have to read other texts like Carroll or Inverno for intermediate level and Wald for higher level."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"This is the best book for understanding gravity mathematically at the level of an advanced undergraduate. Though intended for the classroom (and based on a class at UCSB) there are many aspects of this book which make it nearly ideal for self-study:* interesting side-bars, with some math* thorough details in mathematical explanations* never too much repetition of covered material* moves from special cases (with applications) to more general cases, allowing the student to learn a little at a time (which is rare in books on general relativity)The only downside is that it doesn't go quite as far into recent theories as you might like. This is fine for me as I, as a complete layman, would rather understand a bit of relativity well--something I missed in my undergraduate physics training."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"Most books I read about GR assume that you are some kind of math genius who after a few pages where you are introduced to stuff such as \\"vectors as directional derivatives\\" etc; you are supposed to be able to master differential geometry, curved spacetime and all the mathematical equipment of GR.James Hartle's book is nothing like that. The reader gets to the physics of GR with math he can actually understand (Newtonian and Lagrangian formalism of Mechanics is enough as a background)and equations he can derive easily for himself. It's amazing that just at the 9th chapter of the overall 24 chapters of the book you can see derived the easiest way the orbits of a particle outside a black hole!In short, Hartle starts where the other books about GR end, that is with the physics. And he ends where the other books begin, that is with the difficult math. This is, in my opinion, what makes this book so interesting and where all his beaty and strength lies in."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"Not many books on gravitation are clear and concise but this one is.I have the big Bible \\"Gravitation\\" from Wheeler but then if you areusing for introductory course then this one is the best. It assumes that reader is new to this subject and proceeds step by step. Tensors are introduced as they are needed in the text so that you don't get lot of information at once. The chapters are as follows,1: Gravitational Physics2: Space, Time, and Gravity in Nwt physics.3: Principles of SR.4: SR Mechanics5: Gravity as Geometry.6: The Description of Spacetime.7: Geodesics8: The Geometry Outside a Spherical Star.9: Solar System Test of GR10: Relativistic Gravity in Action.11: Gravitational Collasp and Black Holes.12: Astrophysical Black Holes.13: A Little Rotation.14: Rotating Black Holes.15: Gravitational Waves.16: The Universe Observed.17: Which Universe and Why?18: A Little more Math.19: Curvature and Einstein Equation.20: The Source of Curvature.21: Gravitational Wave Emmision.22: Relativistic Stars.I guess it's a very good text for the introduction to GR. Less math than Weinberg but precisely good. If you are considering an intro to GR, Gravitation then this would be a good choice. The price is also very reasonable."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"This is a successful textbook covering intermediate levels between advanced undergraduate and graduate. This was long-sought book for senior students who understood special relativity and wanted to learn general relativity. Ofcourse those of Misner-Thorne-Wheeler and Weinberg are the classics in the field and Wald is the best known graduate text. But Hartle's text is a very good introduction for undergrads from other branches of Science and Engineering and for Physics as well. I personally was looking for a good introductory text for GR and I would congratulate Jim Hartle for being the author of this marvelous piece who is also a forerunner in the gravitational research."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"I purchased \\"Gravity\\" as part of an effort to learn more about modern physics. I do not have the money or schedule to take courses at a university, so I have been purchasing books and reading them on my own time. I wanted something that would give a deep, rigorous understanding of the subject matter. So far, after a month and a half of regular reading, I have made through the first seven chapters.So far, I am not dissapointed. \\"Gravity\\" begins from where I left off (years ago, taking the physics courses mandatory for chemistry majors in a bachelors program) and builds precept upon precept to take the reader into the world of general relativity. The book uses language that is clear, and examples that help to further explain the concepts being taught in the course. For those of us who are not \\"mathheads\\", the mathematics needed to understand the material beyond basic calculus and algebra is taught within the text. This book is helping me to gain a better understanding of this area of physics.I do have one \\"bone to pick\\", however, with the organization of the text. Like most textbooks, this one, usefully, has problems at the ends of the chapters. I like to work on a sampling of problems to solidify what I have learned. The problems are well written, and force you to think about the subject matter. However, none of the problems have answers in the back of the book! I understand that in a graded course, there is the temptation for some students to simply look up the answers, and not do the work. However, many textbooks have answers to selected problems. If this book had this, it would still leave many problems for assigned work for those taking a course, but allow self or independent studiers like me the opportunity to work some problems and see if we are on the right track in understanding the material."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"Great introduction to Relativity. Many examples and relations to the 'real world'. Similar approach as The Bible (Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler), but, in my opinion, this book is much more organized and reads easier."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"When an author can write a book on a complicated subject so that anyone without prior knowledge can understand the content, he is truly a gifted writer. Gravity: An Intoduction to Einstein's General Relativity by James Hartle delivers. I studied calculus and had one course in non-calculus physics 35 years ago and was amazed at how much I could understand from this book. I am also reading \\"Relativity DeMystified\\" for a different perspective but Hartle is a true winner.One note: If relativity is your primary goal you can read chapters 1-9 and skip to 20 and then 21 (Curvature and the Einstein Equation) for a short cut, according to Appendix D (Pedagogical Strategy). Its all great stuff though, so take your time and enjoy."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"This is the best book I've seen in mathematics or physics. It brings out the beauty of the geometry and has wonderful examples that allow you to understand and remember the concepts more quickly and more throughly than I thought possible. The problems are beautiful too. And the price is great also. Read this book before the others, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"This is an introductory book for people who desire to learn the basics of general relativity but do not have much background on the subject. The book follows a somehow unconventional path. As opposed to the traditional approach, where you need to survive the difficult introductory chapters covering the necessary mathematical background, the author has managed to explain most of the subjects on general relativity without using tensors, the Einstein field equation or related difficult topics. Only at the end of the book these subjects are introduced.This is one of the barriers most beginners find when approaching general relativity. Many people get lost in the mathematical introductory chapters and have no real chance to enter into real physics. The advantage is in this book, from the very beginning, you get immersed into interesting physical phenomena; explained systematically and very pedagogically by the author. The disadvantage is some concepts look too forced with unconventional explanations and, since tensor calculus is covered only in the last few pages, the level of detail is not very high.Overall, I recommend this book for beginners with good background in physics. It is a pleasure to the read and you can learn quite a few interesting subjects. Do not misunderstand me, the book has lots of formulas and you must be fluent in mathematics, but a least you can avoid tensors, which are too difficult for most readers. On my side I prefer the traditional way. It is true going trough the tensor calculus part is hard, but you cannot avoid the beauty of discovering general relativity using this powerful tool."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"Let me just say, for an introductory textbook, nobody does it better than Hartle!Very motivating...keeps physics the central topic of discussion instead of wandering off topic.My only complaint is that Einstein's equation is introduced towards end of the book, giving it a false idea that it is \\"incomprehensible\\" which is not true.But really, great job Hartle!"},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"This is short and sweet: Absolutely a phenomenal and exciting book for learning this subject!! Have tried for a few years on my own to learn GR. Am a former physics major. Have read other mathematically detailed books and got rather lost in the symbology. This book's approach is clean and based largely on the Lagrainian (which I certainly have had to review). Results of curved space altering the metric are presented first and the physics they result in. Don't kid yourself. Despite the better approach, considerable mathematical sophistication and work is necessary to follow the author. The pursuit is well worth it!!

It is by far the most comprehensible delivery of general relativity I've read. Other books have the math, but lack in explaining how the math relates to physical reality.

Since I already understand the gamma factor I figured it would be no big deal, and it wasn't because he explained everything very carefully...until equation 4.5 on page 55. Right before this equation he says \\"From Equations 4.3 and 4.4 it is straightforward to derive\\" and gives this strange formula. He massages and negates equation 4.4 and adds something to both sides. He doesn't even appear to use equation 4.3. No hints of what he did. It would be no big deal except that he then says \\"This mathematical identity is the key to identifying an invariant\\" and proceeds to the final result, which is a critically important and fundamental formula.In other words he blows off explaining one of the most important steps in understanding special relativity as being \\"straightforward\\" even though he explains trivial observations/steps in detail. He may be an \\"expert\\" on gravity but this makes me wonder how well he actually understands what he is writing about. What he is saying is\\"Here's how you can derive a crucial formula:First do this because of thisnow do this because this happensand do this here because of thatNow let me write down this \\"straightforward\\" formula that you can surely deriveA little manipulation to my formula andPresto!To his credit, when he does explain what he is doing it is usually in sufficient detail to understand what he means."},{"Title":"Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity","review":"When I started reading this book, I just wanted to see what kind of book it is, because I was curious, and I had read several books about Gravity before.

It is a very comprehensive and interesting written book, without being \\"too simple\\" (on the contrary, the level is high). It covers all aspects of General Relativity and Gravitation, from the foundations until applications, and both the physics and mathematics are presented in a highly understandable way.

It seems like Hartle presents all the information in the wrong order.

You just have to try to memorize all the equations without really understanding them. I think a much better book to start out with is Introducing Einstein's Relativity by D'Inverno.

The story is set in 2031 when SETI (The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) finally succeeds in detecting intelligent radio signals from space. The rest of the story takes place several decades later after earth broadcasts a response to the alien signal. At its most basic level, The Cloud is a moral lesson of what happens to the curious cat and poses the question: If there is intelligent life in the universe, is it such a good idea to announce our presence?My criterion for judging a book is quite simple: Was I entertained? The short answer for this book is: YES. Mr. Hammond displays solid chops in styling and pacing. The storyline is underscored by a sense of urgency as a huge destructive space cloud closes in on earth. The urgency in the story becomes in essence, a central character in the story as it takes on the form of New York Times Articles chronicling the approach of the space cloud.There is the derivative factor that is difficult to overlook. It's hard to find a work of science fiction that is not colored by the past works of other writers and the Cloud is no exception. From the first chapter to the last, I could not help but be reminded of either movies or books that I've read in the past. Deadly space cloud approaching earth: Star Trek the movie. Super intelligent computer personality that rebels against its creator: 2001 Space Odyssey. Even the ending brings to mind Douglas Adams. But where such implication might have rendered other books unreadable, Ray Hammond utilizes not-so-unique plot elements to string together a compelling and thought-provoking narrative.At times I felt that the story was rushed, important events glossed over in a few sentences, and pivotal questions regarding the nature of the space cloud were answered far to late in the story. There are other points to the story which I would have liked seen elaborated on, but its impossible to discuss them without giving away details of the book. Overall, I really enjoyed The Cloud and recommend it to Amazon readers."},{"Title":"The Cloud","review":"This is the worst science in science fiction that I've read in a long, long time. This hack couldn't even be bothered to do a quick google search on Atmosphere formation. If he had, never would've written that it would possibly form back in a couple thousand years but it needs plants, so maybe not. That's absurd. The Earth's atmosphere grew from outgassing of trapped volatiles during the rapid volcanic activity of early Earth coupled with a lot of meteor strikes. This is impossible now because the rate of tectonics is much slower. As well, it likely took hundreds of millions of years, although we don't currently have a decent estimate. On top of that PLANTS did even exist for billions (note the billions, not millions, not thousands) of years after atmospheric formation had already happened.Worst of all is the fact that NONE of this guy's velocities & distances add up. He's got it coming too slow into the solar system which would take years to get here, not months. Then it's has \\"sped up\\" to 200,000 thousand kph to hit Mars. If it had been going 200,000 kph from Pluto it would've taken 4yrs to reach Mars, not a few months. Then it \\"slows down\\" to 2,000,000 kph to go around the sun. Last I checked you CAN'T slow down from 2 thousand to 2 million. This, then, takes weeks, but to actually traverse the distance at that speed, it would take less than 10days.What? You can't do simple math???? distance/speed = time !!!!Meanwhile, inert gasses can't be magenta and green. If there was nuclear reactions in the cloud, it would give off heat & light that we could detect (which it didn't seem to). And I'd love to see the model where a cloud between us and the sun makes the planet hotter - because it doesn't! Blowing up a gas cloud with nukes? It doesn't get any more absurd than that.This guy should give up \\"science\\" fiction and write... well, no... he shouldn't... because all his characters were flat. Oh no, the evil, stupid government wants to blow everything up with knee jerk reactions while the idealistic, anti-establishment hippy protester figures it all out while the guru scifi writer preaches a message of peace. It is cliche' cardboard cutout writing and his editor and publisher should be ashamed."},{"Title":"The Cloud","review":"This book is another one of those random novels which I stumbled upon in a 2nd book shop and figured I'd give it a shot even before I researched it on Amazon. Being 389 pages or so, you'd think the book would read longer than it actually is. However, the print isn't so small, so the book reads more like 250 page book (that's my impression). I managed to finish this book in a mere 3 sitting mainly because the flow of the plot was quick: it was steady and engrossing! That doesn't happen very often in novels because of one main drawback: a fast plot leaves the cast struggling to gain private characterization in between all the action. And that is exactly where The Cloud fails- a quick plot envelopes the main characters and leaves them unrefined and fairly flat amidst all else that happens. BUT, when it comes to technology and speculation, The Cloud will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Cloud","review":"** spoilers **Whilst the notion of a space cloud threatening life as we know it is far from an original one (as with the previous reviewer, I too was reminded of several Star Trek plots), Hammond builds the sense of anticipation skillfully enough to maintain the reader's interest. The change in humankind's perception of what was initially seen as a benign message from another civilisation into a threat of unparalelled magnitude was cleverly handled and reflects the complexity of the whole SETI business; whether we are alone in the universe or not, either way the concept is mind-boggling (and terrifying!).So far so good!Perhaps I'm being over picky here but my enjoyment of this yarn was somewhat compromised by a series of silly mistakes in the text. Claims made about the velocity of the cloud on its approach to Earth and of the plans to launch a nuclear assault upon it whilst it is still well beyond the solar system, simply don't add up! Furthermore, Hammond seems to be very inconsistent about the Earth's population; on page 288 he claims that 10% of the world's population equates to ten million people (!), whereas some 60 pages later 95% of the Earth's population has become the more realistic \\"billions\\".You may also find that the politics grate a bit - cyberluddites triumphing over the big bad military wolf, whilst you play spot the similarity to other sci-fi novels (a clue: 2001 figures largely!).The Cloud is worth finishing though. I've certainly read worse than this."},{"Title":"Woman's Place","review":"This book turned out to be a good read for, maybe, a book club.

I like the style she chose as far as giving the chapters character names instead of simply numbering them. Its as if she gave a different voice for each chapter and you as the reader were to read from that character's viewpoint.My biggest criticism of this book is that sometimes it was hard to follow who was saying what.

It contained the translation of some of Lear's best rhymes rendered in Italian. Each written page was matched by a drawing which pictured the main character of the limerick, in a grotesque and funny way, in garish colours. It was to my mind a small masterwork. We laughed so much at night looking at the book and reading the absurd descriptions of incredible creatures, that those memories are among the sweetest of that period long past. And after so many years I just came to believe that those obstreperous heteroclite old men and women (most are old, seldom are they young) are after all the most realistic one could describe, as this world is just so topsy turvy that what at first may seem most absurd is just the most realistic of the pictures of what exists, body and soul, under a slim cover of apparent seriousness.

The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It's free, but it's hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me."},{"Title":"Book of Nonsense","review":"I'm going to review this briefly as a book for children, which is what it is. I read most of this to my 3-year-old (including all the limericks and most of the poems, and a little of the other stuff). As long as I didn't read it too often, my son was usually game for this. He liked it but he didn't love it to pieces. The nonsense and silliness certainly appeals to silly little kids, and why shouldn't it? And as far as I'm concerned, it's excellent, and deservedly considered classic children's lit., but frankly, I didn't think it was five-stars great. The conceits and poetry are not always exactly inspired, and the illustrations are pretty crude, although plenty entertaining.\\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" (which we've read many times) and some of the limericks are definitely five-star selections in any case.At $5, this is a nice cheap edition. It would help if the pictures were in color, but I gather you're getting it closer to what was published in the 19th century here."},{"Title":"Book of Nonsense","review":"As a graduate student in history, I know that the Edward Lear original included hilarious illustrations that make this work even better and, therefore, the reading more enjoyable.

Here is an example of some of my favorites.\\"There was an old man of Quebec-- a beetle ran over his neck; But he cried \\"With a needle, I slay you O beadle!\\" That angry old man of Quebec.\\"\\"There was an old man with a poker, who painted his face a red ochre. When they said \\"You're a guy!\\" he made no reply, But knocked them all down with his poker.\\"and my favorite of them all, which any spongebob fan would love, \\"There was an old man of Peru, who watched his wife make stew; but once, by mistake, in a stove she did bake, that unfortunate man of Peru.\\""},{"Title":"Book of Nonsense","review":"I &#34;bought&#34; this book for Kindle.

This book is not always easy reading material. It's a lighter read compared to Isis Unveiled and the Secret Doctrine. However from a content perspective it provides extremely valuable occult insights which can be used as basis for further comparative studies.Based on his own occult observations the author does not hesitate in debunking Buddhist fallacies re Karma and re-incarnation.In Volume 2 the very rare tables of Aeth is made available and strong practical guidance is given re subjects to mediate on.Overall a hard to find book and a very valuable reference book for any occult student's library."},{"Title":"The Light of Egypt, or the Science of the Soul and the Stars Vol I & II","review":"This book is a treasure chest crammed full of occult wisdom. There is much about the Hermetic occult and their beliefs in this book. I had the feeling I was peering into another dimension and way of viewing the world while reading the information within this text. Burgoyne does a great job assembling the beliefs and practices of Hermeticism, with first hand experience, in an introductory but engaging way. Highly Recommended for seekers of wisdom and students of Hermeticism, the Occult, or Comparative Religions."},{"Title":"Introductory Structural Analysis","review":"This book was extremely difficult to understand in comparison to some of Salmon's other texts, such as Steel Structures: Design and Behavior. This text lacks a thorough explanation of problems. From a student's perspective or a first time learner's, this is not the best choice. Hibbler has a much better book on Structural Analysis with helpful examples and diagrams. This book expects students to work extremely difficult problems at the end of the chapter without working any examples of similar difficulty. For professors, this book does offer real to life problems that are complex and challenging, but another text may be needed to explain underlying concepts (e.g. influence lines)."},{"Title":"Introductory Structural Analysis","review":"I have many structural analysis textbooks and I can say this is one of the better ones.

Occasionally, the reader is even &quot;treated&quot; to a little tidbit explaining the list.Between the lack of supplementary material and the sometimes pathetic lists--The &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot; (Batman and Robin) get their own list? and so do the Monopoly properties, as if I couldn't just look at a board--I have to say I was less than impressed.If you're looking to quiz people with trivia, though, it's not bad, I suppose."},{"Title":"A Concise Hopi and English Lexicon","review":"This was the best lexicographical resource for Hopi at the time of its publication, and it is still the best for this price, but buyers should note the caveat in the introduction: \\"In addition to being limited to vocabulary items of common usage, the 'Concise Hopi and English Lexicon' treats only Third Mesa dialect.\\"The lexicon is bi-directional, with the first half Hopi-English and the second English-Hopi. Plurals are provided for all words (nouns, verbs, etc.)where this is relevant and duratives are provided for most verbs. Compound elements (such as adjectives) are cited along with their free forms and pre-pausal forms are cited where they cannot be predicted. Short notes on pronunciation and morphology are provided. The range of vocabulary is fairly comprehensive within the limits suggested by the designation 'concise', with roughly 4800 words in each section with a one-to-one correspondence between the English-Hopi and Hopi-English sections.This is an excellent intermediate dictionary and the fact that it is two-way makes it indispensible for all learners of Hopi."},{"Title":"A Concise Hopi and English Lexicon","review":"Concise is an understatement. I was looking to translate our Indian Princess names into Hopi, since we're the Hopi tribe, and I find that there are a lot of words missing. Take the word forest, I was looking for that, but could only find the word trunk(of a tree). I don't have the money for the full blown dictionary at $750 but thought the lexicon would see me through. It really hasn't and I have had to use different words to replace them. One tribe member is called Running Pheasant. There's no word for pheasant, so he has to be Horned Owl.

It is very simple, concise, but has most of the basics. We read through the book in about the three weeks, about one hour per day. It gave her a good understanding of some of the basic geometry concepts.The book has a few errors, but not a big deal, in my opinion.I recommend this book if you want to use it as an introduction guide to basic geometry concepts to a middle schooler."},{"Title":"Cracking the Golden State Exams: Geometry (Princeton Review: Cracking the Golden State Geometry)","review":"Alright, we got this book hoping it would help (being the Princeton Review and all)...and it did--a bit. After awhile we started noticing very stupid mistakes every once in a while. It got out of hand when the book proclaimed that 60 times 0.5 was still sixty...and on the fourth practice test there were five mistakes--all very stupid ones. Some parts of questions were actually omitted so it was impossible to do them. For a specific example, on page 213 question six had no real answer. How can you tell from just the picture? Anyway, if you get this book be prepared for many errors (though they were good for laughs, they don't really help when you're studying for exams)."},{"Title":"Dental Implants: The Art and Science","review":"This book tells you what to look out for during examination and diagnosis and how to make use of study casts for treatment planning. I find the chapters on bone grafting to be especially helpful.However, there are 2 problems. As expected in this sunrise industry, the implant systems featured in the book are already quite outdated. I can't imagine myself using an external hex anymore. Restoration nowadays is also a lot less complicated with a wider range of abutments and other accessories.Secondly, the surgical techniques are almost never explained in detail. Perhaps an interactive handson course would be better able to impart that, but if you're a newbie, don't expect to learn much about surgical procedures. A bit disappointing for me when I first bought it, given the size and price of the book."},{"Title":"Dental Implants: The Art and Science","review":"This comprehensive dental implant textbook is a must for the dentist who wants to be well informed on the intricacies of placing and restoring dental implants.From case selection to surgical technique and prosthetic applications, this book is not only informative, but should be reviewed regularly. Even maintenance and hygiene protocols are addressed in wonderful detail.The young dental student coming out of their program needs to comprehend many techniques not completely taught in dental school.

The band itself lost one of its own from the attacks, as well as the brother of a member; Bagpipe Brothers recounts in vivid detail the emotions, experiences, terrible grief and striving to help any way one can in the wake of tragedy. A profound and powerful tribute to both the lost and the survivors struggling to cope."},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"As a fiftyish Irish American who has peered so deeply at the realities of 9/11 through the audiotapes of Smith's &quot;Report from Ground Zero&quot;, Halberstam's &quot;Firehouse&quot;, countless documentaries and the NYTimes profile of the victims, I was unprepared for the up close and personal journey that author Kerry Sheridan swept me into as I read this this poignant, insightful, revealing and eventually hopeful book of men and women's reaction to their own tragedies and their willingness to give of themselves to help others deal with unbearable grief.The author brilliantly brings into focus the realities of everyday people faced by all the dimensions of tragedy and heroism as they go about their chosen duties for family, friends and strangers. Be prepared to chuckle at her capturing the language of firefighter's lives as they accept and judge one another so rawly from (+) &quot;buff&quot; to (-)&quot;peacock&quot;.This young author has touched my soul and deepened my appreciation for all those heroically enmeshed in such a nerve shattering event followed by a year of tragedy,fear,jealousy, incredible stamina, energy and heroism. Reading his book enables us to grasp realities of the complexities of heroism and tragedy of personal loss. Recommend this book thoroughly - you'll not soon forget the emotions that reading it will touch in you."},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"From the first page, I was hooked. I felt like I was living that day all over again. This time, I wasn't sitting in my home in Seattle in shock and horror, I was in New York with an emotional connection to the families mentioned in the book and those not mentioned. I have a new found respect for all fire fighters. I already have a great deal of respect for those who put there lives on the line for any job but now it's impossible to put into words the level of respect I have for them.This book WILL take you on an amazing emotional journey."},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"As a drummer in a fire band, the story of Bronko broke my heart.

We will never forget!"},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"Ms. Sheridan really brought this book into my heart. She knew exactly how to make me feel for these brave men and after I was done reading I really wanted to know more because I truly felt connected with them. Excellent book and I do recommend anyone wanting to read a book about the FDNY to read this book first!!!!!"},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of the pipers and drummers pf the FDNY pipe band. Written in a strong journalistic style, the suthor really conveys the strength of these men and their close relationships.While she gets a few details of uniform (shawls for piper's plaids) and piping (puffing on their pipes) wrong, she's really captured the feelings of these men who face danger and death on a daily basis."},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"This book is very powerful. I picked this book up and thought it would be an interesting read then I could not believe how moved I would become. It is well written and allows the reader to get close to the men and their families. The readers anxiety grows as the date of September 11 approaches. I had to put the book aside a few times and remind myself of the gratitude I feel toward the brave men who gave their lives to save others and inspiration from those who survived and went back to look for family members, friends and complete strangers in order for those who were murdered to be laid to rest properly. The unity and brotherhood of the elite group of bagpipe players is inspirational. Thank you to the author for allowing readers to gain a new perspective of the days following September 11 and what the FDNY suffered. I felt as though I knew these men personally."},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"As a member of the fire service community, I have read several books describing the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center twin towers, and the resulting death of 343 FDNY firefighters and thousands of civilians. This book, \\"Bagpipe Brothers\\",is certainly one of the most poignant as the author describes what the FDNY bagpipe band members went through during that fateful day,and the year following this immense tragedy. For the members of this great organization, they were doing one of three things : playing at funerals for their fallen brothers, digging in \\"the pile\\", or performing their regular tours in the city's firehouses. I find this book to be a \\" must read \\" for any member or freind of the fire service."},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"This is a great book. A little history on bagpipes, a little history on the FDNY Emerald Society and a front row seat into the post 9-11 world of the FDNY. Having read dozens of books on the topic, Bagpipe Brothers takes me places I haven't seen before. This is a book that will probably pull out in a couple of years to remind what happened to our Country when we were attacked by islamic terrorists.Don't let the 9-11 mosque be built. Fight. Fight. Fight!"},{"Title":"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story of Tragedy, Mourning, and Recovery","review":"This book is a must read.

You won't be sorry......"},{"Title":"Freedom's Plow","review":"In 1943, with America at war, the African-American poet Langston Hughes penned his stirring \\"Freedom's Plow.\\" Immediately after it was written, the long poem was broadcast by radio throughout the nation on the old RCA Blue Network.It was a year of bitter fighting in North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific. The outcome of the war was not at all clear. African-Americans were enlisting in the armed forces to join the fight. At that time they could serve only in segregated units, and they knew their unequal treatment, even in uniform, did not match the high-minded ideals proclaimed by America's leaders. Hughes' response was to celebrate the community, the dream, and the unity of America in this striking poem.Community and dream were consistent themes in Langston Hughes' poetry, though different poems expressed them at different times, in different voices, and with different moods. Scholars are still mining Hughes' poems to grasp everything he meant whenever he wrote the word \\"dream,\\" for instance. Of course, Dr. Martin Luther King (who was 14 at the time \\"Freedom's Plow\\" was published) used \\"I Have a Dream\\" for his great 1963 appeal to all Americans at the Lincoln Memorial. Both Hughes and King looked for Americans to make a society united around a full realization of the nation's founding ideals -- to make good on the promise of the Declaration that all men are created equal.When you read this poem, remember it was written in 1943, when fascism and its murderous racism stalked the world. In the 21st century, many people, to use the poem's words, now own freedom, brotherhood, and democracy. But at the time, many nations were conquered while others still yearned for independence. Langston Hughes called America -- a flawed America, yes -- to rally around its ideals, the dream. In another two decades, Dr. King would do the same.-30-"},{"Title":"Sisters of the Earth: Women's Prose and Poetry About Nature","review":"Sisters of the Earth is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a collection of stories on woman's relationship to the earth. Each short piece is written by a woman from the United States from any time in our history - about some connection she has with the earth. I've turned down so many pages in this book and put in little post-it notes saying &quot;great!&quot;. After reading one of the stories a new author's work is now available to me. I give this book to others as a gift all the time. The stories themselves are personal reflections of nature that speak softly to me of the wonders I am surrounded by and often fail to notice. These stories remind me of where I really live and how powerful my connection is to the earth. I would love to see a second volume by Lorraine Anderson on this topic, she has selected well. I have also read Cries of the Spirit, also a book about woman's connection to the earth and found it very good also."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Earth: Women's Prose and Poetry About Nature","review":"I found a lot more than I'd expected in this book. The editor obviously put a lot of thought into her selection of authors and passages from their works. It seemed to me as if these were the passages I would have marked for rereading had I read those works myself. Pretty much every selection struck me as being beautifully inspirational, poetic, or otherwise moving. I'd forgotten how much simply reading about nature can do to lift and heal the spirit. I also learned a lot: I was unaware that so many women have been writing about nature for so many years -- and it was sobering to realize that much of what the earlier authors wrote about no longer exists in our world today.The author bios themselves make for fascinating reading. (You can't help but wonder how your own life would be summed up in a paragraph or two.) And of course, as I'd expect from any good anthology, this collection inspired me to add quite a few items to my &quot;to-read&quot; list. The nearly 40-page bibliography includes very helpful summaries, and lists not just the sources of this anthology's selections but many other works as well.Whatever you might expect from Sisters of the Earth, I doubt you'll be disappointed. There should be something in it for everyone -- and it's a pretty book that would make a great gift."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Earth: Women's Prose and Poetry About Nature","review":"Naturalists is perhaps too narrow a word choice for the one hundred contributors to this anthology; I suspect only a few would use that word when describing themselves. Their ages span more than a century, so the style of writing varies widely, but each has something quite special to share with a reader looking for a few moments of luminousness or quiet revelation in the midst of a busy day.Here's one of my favorite bits, and I'm paraphrasing: Men climb mountains to conquer them; women climb mountains to go deeper within themselves, to feel a oneness with nature. When I read that, I lifted my eyes from the page, stared at the horizon and thought how much more poetic and truthful that is than the usual Mars/Venus type of comparison.Contributors range from regionalist Sarah Orne Jewett to internationalist Diane Ackerman; there are African Americans, Native Americans, Jews, Catholics, mystics, and poets among this mix, with plenty of boundary crossing.Very lovely. Not, I believe, a book meant to be read cover to cover. Rather, let it rest beside your favorite reading chair or at your bedside, and read a few entries now and then at random. I think you'll be charmed, as I was."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Earth: Women's Prose and Poetry About Nature","review":"I have found this book to be wonderful in the growth process of the spirit.

In short, this collection touches the soul."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Earth: Women's Prose and Poetry About Nature","review":"Before there was eco-psychology or eco-spirituality, there was the ever ebbing co-creation of nature. Especially noticed by the Feminine, or feminine energy if you prefer, the cyclical pulse of Earth's body is beautifully shared in this book of women's prose and poetry.

This book should be a required text for all student teachers beginning their experience in the classroom.If only this book had been written 28 years ago when my career began! It certainly could have helped me to avoid some of the hard knocks of the realities of experience. One of the topics included in this book is the unspoken politics of the professional undefined hierarchy within the school, which I've never before seen addressed. The advice suggested for newcomers into the field can definitely allow for more positive personal relations and a less fearful, self-doubting or threatening working environment. This book contains answers and suggested solutions to so many real problem situations within the classroom setting as well as in the whole school environment.Most teachers don't even realize they are not yet asking themselves the right questions when self assessing their reasons for the stress and anxieties they feel as they prepare to go to school each day. By the time one even recognizes and accepts that physical problems may exist as a result of the emotional traumas and strains of the job, the solutions are too far out of their energy level to attain.

I'm recommending this book to my student teachers with the following suggestion: This book is meant to be read.Although thumbing through and reading headings, examples, and scenarios can be helpful, it is well worth the time to read The New Teacher's Handbook completely. It is written with humor and sensitivity toward beginning teaching problems and filled with useful teaching strategies. It does not insult young teachers as it is not full of pictures, platitudes, and large type. Charts and forms are informative and useful.

This book should be a required text for all student teachers beginning their experience in the classroom.If only this book had been written 28 years ago when my career began! It certainly could have helped me to avoid some of the hard knocks of the realities of experience. One of the topics included in this book is the unspoken politics of the professional undefined hierarchy within the school, which I've never before seen addressed. The advice suggested for newcomers into the field can definitely allow for more positive personal relations and a less fearful, self-doubting or threatening working environment. This book contains answers and suggested solutions to so many real problem situations within the classroom setting as well as in the whole school environment.Most teachers don't even realize they are not yet asking themselves the right questions when self assessing their reasons for the stress and anxieties they feel as they prepare to go to school each day. By the time one even recognizes and accepts that physical problems may exist as a result of the emotional traumas and strains of the job, the solutions are too far out of their energy level to attain. I have witnessed this situation countless times and it is often too late for the pieces to be put back together as one goes down for the third time......with defeat and resignation in hand.If only The New Teacher's Handbook had been available to the hundreds of excellent and qualified professionals who chose to leave the profession because they felt they had no way to find solutions and alternative strategies and practices to deal with the challenges, troubles, stress and unspoken negatives of the profession.Thank you, Yvonne Bender, for possibly saving the profession of so many new teachers who are just about to step over that glorified idealistic threshold into the den of reality. With your book as a resource and hopefully the advice and expertise of others who already have learned the HARD way to stay happy, satisfied and sane in the profession, the teaching force will have a much better chance of continuing to grow and maintain its qualified newcomers."},{"Title":"The Bannock of Idaho","review":"Brigham Madsen provides a good through history of the Bannock nation. His focus/speculation on how they became seperate from the Snake nation and on their continued existance in regards to buffaloe hunting provide an excellent benefit to reading this book.

It is definitely a \\"start where you are\\" book, with lots of good basic information about how to get started for those who are a little nervous about it. It would be a great book for health professionals to direct their patients who need to get moving to. There is a chapter on goal setting that is very realistic. The 6 week program starts at a very basic level, but there are more advanced levels for those who can take it. It is non-judgmental in tone. It is not for those who have been active for a while, but it serves it's intended purpose very well."},{"Title":"ACSM Fitness Book - 3rd","review":"This book is an update of a book I have had and used for years.

This didn't require me to go to a gym or buy additional products or equipment. It is also research based which is important to me. If you are looking to set up a bodybuilding routine, start ultra distance running, or break into any other highly specialized area of fitness you will be served better by a specialty book. However, if you are looking to set up a flexible, sustainable, general fitness routine that can be done at home this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"ACSM Fitness Book - 3rd","review":"Recommended by Dr. Stephen A.

Sammy had a big chip on his shoulder which he carried throughout his life but it is understandable when you read what he went through.

Before he became universally beloved, Davis had to endure, and overcome, brutal bigotry.

The Sammy Davis, Jr. Story","review":"His title is poignant--it could mean, \\"Why am I discriminated against just for being black?\\" or it could mean, \\"Why did God single me out for such stardom and an extraordinary life?\\" Both of these themes weave throughout the book. Sammy was part of a show-biz trio with his father and \\"uncle\\" Will Mastin. He began performing at a very young age, and these two kind men managed to shelter him against racism until he entered the Army. Then, literally from day one, he faced the worst of racial hatred and ostracism, which lasted well into his famous years. He had his nose broken three times. He could play in a Las Vegas club, but had to find accommodations elsewhere. He could not enter the casinos where he played. When he married the blonde and beautiful May Britt, there were still states that had miscegenation on the books, so they could not travel together legally. But little short, one-eyed Sammy was determined to beat the odds. \\"If I'm a star,\\" he figured, \\"I can break down these doors.\\" But he didn't have an easy time of it. The whites thought he was too black, and the blacks thought he was too Uncle Tom. He was all set to perform at JFK's inauguration, when he was suddenly \\"uninvited.\\" He became personal friends with MLK, Jr. and RFK, only to see them gunned down. His marriage to May died because he was the \\"always on\\" guy, drinking and whoring and never there for their three kids. He HAD to live up to his \\"swinger\\" image, and he felt that stardom was the only hedge against his being deemed a second-class citizen. He then met Altovise, a black woman whom he married. It seems as though she had a much better tolerance for his over-the-top lifestyle than May did. But he still ended up $1M in arrears to the IRS, which he eventually paid off. (He was always good at earning money, but even better at spending it.) He was a brilliant star, good at singing and dancing. telling jokes, and playing the trumpet and drums. Frank Sinatra was his lifelong friend, giving him breaks and encouraging him every step of the way. And Sammy championed RFK as the best president that we could have had during our times for civil rights. This book ends four years before his death, but the cause of death was throat cancer--too much singing and smoking and drinking killed him in the end. But what a ride!"},{"Title":"Why Me?

He has a talent for writing that comes close to real advertisements but just pushes it a little bit further such as &quot;Fireblast! Twice the car you'll ever need - and that goes double for the new four-door FunTop!&quot;In this colorful book, after some pages spoofing dream car shows (&quot;It's un-American to miss the Cavalcade of Chrome&quot;), the bulk of the book has delightful full-page drawings of outrageous concept cars. Each has a half page history on the facing page.One is the &quot;Silver Sabre Patriomatic Funfighter, 1957&quot; which looks only slightly more like a jet airplane than Pontiac's actual Firebird dream cars. Another is the &quot;Armageddon Mk1, 1958&quot; for the fallout shelter crowd. And there are many, many more with great variety. A few may be too silly for some tastes, but they are all wonderfully drawn.The book wraps up with &quot;Name Your Own Dream Car - the Detroit Way&quot; and finally &quot;Dream Cars Around the World&quot; with yet more drawings and descriptions.This book is a satisfying satirical, or perhaps all too true, look into the fifties and a great value even if you're only going to look at the drawings."},{"Title":"The Last Dream-o-Rama","review":"I really liked this book.

She meets the daughter she abandoned for her music, fourteen-year-old Amy, who believes her mother died in childbirth. At least that is the lie her father William Ludlow told her.Neither Sophie nor William plan to tell their daughter the truth, but Amy learns it anyway. The teen is hurt, angry, and confused that her dad lied and her mom abandoned her without a look back. As Sophie sees a second chance to atone for the biggest mistake of her life, she prays Amy will let her in and that William still loves her as she still does love him.The lead trio keeps Margot Early's tale from becoming overwhelmingly maudlin as each character seems real with genuine concerns especially on their current dilemma and relationships. William always thought he did the right thing by protecting his child from the hurt of abandonment, but has doubts now and feels guilt that he still wants Sophie. Amy feels betrayed by her dad for not revealing the truth and wonders what other lies he has told her while also depressed that her mother never wanted her. Sophie is the most unique as she is a combination of guilt and insecurity even as she wants a second chance with her loved ones though she believes she does not deserve it.

Guide to the Middle Way is regarded to this day as the principal text on emptiness, the ultimate nature of reality.In Geshe Kelsang's completely new and authoratative translation of Chandrakirti's root text, he explains clearly and completely, the philisophical reasoning establishing Buddha's most profound view of the middle way, a term that means: anything that is free from the two extremes of existence and non-existence. These different reasonings are indispensable in improving our ability to cut the root of our ignorance and understand the selflessness of all phenomena.Not only does Geshe Kelsang provide the reader with a faultless presentation of the most profound view of emptiness, he also gives a clear explanation of the stages of the vast path.I recommend this book to the serious student interested in improving their knowledge, understanding, and experience of emptiness, the ultimate nature of reality. This is an advanced text on the subject of emptiness, so I would not recommend this to a beginner. For someone wanting to learn what emptiness is, I would recommend one of Geshe Kelsang's other books that include the subject such as Transform Your Life, or Joyful Path to Good Fortune.This book is the definitive guide to the ultimate nature of reality."},{"Title":"Ocean of Nectar: Wisdom and Compassion in Mahayana Buddhism","review":"There is at least one reviewer who thinks this is a bit too sectarian in its approach.

There are no modern sources quoted for this commentary (as is always the case with this author), as if he does not need any support for his opinions. I use the word \\"opinions\\" because despite the fact he uses the title of \\"Geshe\\" the reality of the matter is he was offered the Geshe test, refused it, but decided to use the title anyway. This is kind of like calling yourself a doctor when you have no diploma to back up your claim... ugh!As a previous reviewer states, comprehension of this muddy volume would probably be enhanced if one were a member of his group, the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT), as this title (like all of his books), assumes you follow that sect. For a newcomer to Buddhism or any member of a truly traditional, mainstream Buddhist tradition, this title is self-serving and ultimately meaningless. It does not limit itself to commentary on Guide to the Middle Way, but drags in the usual NKT formula for practice and enlightenment... irrelevant at best.Furthermore, while the translation may be adequate, one has to remember the author can barely speak English, so it is an uncredited translator who actually did the work.[I bought this book by Gyatso when a member of Gyatso's New Kadampa Tradition. After April 22, 2008 (Google the date and the Dalai Lama), I came to realize the true nature of NKT and walked away from it. I read every one of the books I reviewed at a time when I also drank the Kool-Aid.]"},{"Title":"Ocean of Nectar: Wisdom and Compassion in Mahayana Buddhism","review":"This book is a mixed bag.The fact that this book represents one specific and accutely sectarian viewpoint is made abundantly clear by both the translators and Kelsang himself throughout the book. This is unfortunate and detracts from its readability for anyone who is not a member of the New Kadampa Tradition that Kelsang heads.This book is a translation and commentary on the Entrance to the Middle Way (Madhyamakavatara) by Indian Madhyamika Chandrakirti. Chandrakirti offers a strong interpretation of Nagarjuna in this work and in his commentary to Nagarjuna's Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way entitled Clear Words.The root text translated herein is a summation of what Chandrakirti saw to be the philosophical essence of Nagarjuna's teachings. The presentation is organized using the structure of the ten progressive Bodhisattva Grounds by which the yogi is said to progress on the path to Buddhahood. Most of this book is occupied with an analysis of the Sixth Bodhisattva Ground, wherein the yogi completes the perfection of wisdom.Chandrakirti (and Kelsang) present their interpretation of emptiness, which came to be called Prasangika-Madhyamaka by Tibetans, and seek to refute rival interpretations of Buddhist scripture, particularly those espoused by the Mind Only idealist school of Indian philosophy.Kelsang Gyatso's commentary does not view itself as an interpretation; rather it is framed as an explication of the actual meaning of Chandrakirti's text. A reader new to the material may be surprised to learn that the commentary goes well beyond the scope of what Chandrakirti could have argued. Nor does he distinguish between issues that Chandrakirti may have been addressing and those which arose centuries later in Tibet.The result of this is that the reader is left with little sense of the widely divergent uses to which Nagarjuna's thought has been put throughout the Buddhist world.One might think from reading this book that the arguments which Kelsang recasts against holders of other tenet systems are current. In fact, no Buddhist school has defined itself as Cittamatrin for many centuries, and no school has defined itself as Svatantrika ever.I wonder why so much energy is spent reliving debates that have been over for more than a thousand years, and so little energy is spent understanding competing views that are actually propounded by living people.In any case, this book contains a strong translation of the root verses, and the commentary is serviceable, though it is strongly patterned after Je Tsong Khapa's commentary and is not particularly orignal.I am personally turned off by the quiet (but ubiquitous) sectarianism of this work, but I value it as a good translation of an important Madhyamaka text. The commentary is also useful as a methodical presentation based on Ge-luk-ba sources.For an very different (but also flawed) translation and commentary of the Madhyamakavatara, see Huntington's The Emptiness of Emptiness. For a Ge-luk presentation of the sixth chapter, see Geshe Rabten's Echoes of Voidness. The first through the fifth chapter are translated with Tsong-kha-pa's commentary in Jeffrey Hopkins' Compassion in Tibetan Buddhism. A wonderful but extremely challenging study of the issues can be found in the magnificent Path to the Middle by Kensur Yeshe Thubten and Anne Klein."},{"Title":"Ocean of Nectar: Wisdom and Compassion in Mahayana Buddhism","review":"Using prior works, the author extensively (in great detail) explains Chandrakirti's \\"Guide to the Middle Way\\" a compilation of prior works--esp. Nagarjuna's \\"Fundamental Wisdom.\\" This seminal work in the Gelugpa tradition explains the 10 Bodhisattva grounds emphasizing the Madhyamaka-Prasangika (M-P) emptiness of self & objects. It is a highly structured, many-leveled, & Sensate (detail-oriented per the Myers-Briggs) logic-based (Rationalist epistemology) philosophical treatise. There's no attempt to update a medieval text aimed at refuting mostly defunct Buddhist schools--no comparison with contemporary Tibetan ones. It's sectarian, but as a Rime (non-sectarian Vajrayana) proponent, I can still study sectarian texts for ecumenical learning. As \\"honest broker,\\" I note that Tsele Natsok Rangdrol in \\"Empowerment,\\" Anne Klein in Newland's \\"Changing Minds,\\" & Klein & Tenzin Wangyal in \\"Unbounded Wholeness\\") find M-P incompatible with Mahamudra & Dzogchen, and some contemporary schools have 8 consciousness levels vs. M-P's 6. Also, Geshe Gyatso says Masters Dignaga & Vasubandhu presented systems other than Nagarjuna. In addition, the Geshe not only includes the root text but \\"A Brief Summary of Buddhist Tenets\\" for all the schools addressed which was IMHO helpful & informative. Further, the highly condensed, medieval root text is virtually impossible to understand without his explication.It also includes many legends, myths, metaphors. It's interrogatory structure is reminiscent of the Talmud & some of its arguments resemble pilpul (VERY miniscule arguments ~ Western medieval debate over the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin)--philosophy without the balancing epistemology of empiricism (though the author's view of time (p. 221) resembles some quantum mechanics' theorists!) there's circular reasoning (p. 168), binary assumption (vs. Normal Distribution), misuse of Truth Tables, & implication that (self's/objects') existence depends on their being named--vs. Shakespeare's rose by any name & that the sun shined prior to any concepts/names. It's ancient/medieval assumptions existed long before set theory, systems analysis, pattern recognition, gestalt/synergy, information technology, synchronicity & archetypes, & Kant's \\"Critique of Pure Reason.\\" Overall, I found the book maddening & informational--useful but annoying to my Intuitive (big picture) & scientific views.

In the &quot;Great War&quot; trilogy, the USA, now allied with Imperial Germany, is looking for revenge against the Confederate States of America and their Canadian and British allies. When war breaks out in Europe, the two American rivals join their allies and open an American theater to the war. Here, in the final book of the trilogy, the war draws to its bloody conclusion, as new tactics based on evolving technology break the brutal stalemate that has defined the years of trench warfare. These breakthroughs rapidly lead to victory, and the victors, bent on revenge, intend to punish their opponents, thus planting the seeds for future hostilities.Turtledove uses more than a dozen characters to tell this story, representing almost every point of view. We have the stories of civilians, soldiers, and sailors; elisted men and officers; white and black; North, South, and Canadian. We see the sweeping scope of the war on the homefront, as well as on both fronts: In Canada, from Quebec to Ontario to Manitoba; and in the South, from Virginia, to Kentucky and Tenessee, to west of the Mississippi. What most impresses me is that the characters here are real rather than stereotypes. There are characters on both sides that are sympathetic, and just as many on both sides that are despicable. Its hard to decide which side is more right or wrong--they each have virtues and faults. In this, Turtledove's alternate history mirror's reality: There are seldom any easy answers, and most issues are shrouded in layers of grey.I found this series to be a highly entertaining speculative exercise. His extrapolations seem at least passibly plausible, and it is interesting to see how he fits authentic historical figures into his alternate reality. I look forward to reading his next series, and seeing how he deals with the aftermath of the war."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"When Breakthroughs arrived I dived in and started reading from go to whoa! It was great to catch up with all the Great War family again.The United States on top at last!!! Sweet revenge for all after 54 years!I particulary liked the growing inbitterment of Jake Featherston and his resentment against the Confederate establishment. Naturally a parallel to Adolf Hitler - watch this space!The dealings of the Collerton clan and their fight against the Congaree Reds drew to it's enevidable conclusion and the sad outcome of the CSS Bonefish verses USS Erricson left you feeling hollow and seeking revenge.The comical adventures of the righteous Gordon McSweeny sadly ended with this book. It would have been nice if he was to have survived the Great War. But thats the whole idea of this trilogy.I looked foward to the first of the new American Empire trilogy, as it arrived just as I put down Breakthroughs - and the excerpt from Bold and Iron and the end was just what I needed.A word of warning, you can't put this book down once you start reading. Well done Harry,*****five stars"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Turtledove knows his history and his views of alternative results had one or two important incidents in the past been reversed are enormously interesting and certainly possible. I reserve the right to disagree with him on a couple of important points, but after all, alternative histories are completely subjective. Often they represent educated guesses as to what might have happened, but they are guesses nevertheless.He writes exceedingly well, and his stories grab and hold the reader -- while they last. This particularly talent has, unfortunately, a bad side to it. Turtledove has a propensity to slip from place to place, person to person, and situation to situation, without warning, and an individual situation will become so intriguing that I, personally, refuse to leave it. I more often than not find myself flipping through a dozen or so pages looking for the continuation of the adventure in which I just became embroiled. In so doing I will ignore whole episodes within the entire mass merely to follow the exploits of two or three characters caught up in their own personal circumstances.This is unfortunate because it is so unnecessary. Covering all the events that he endeavors to exploit adds very little to the whole if for no other reason than it invites confusion. My answer? Concentrate on one, or at most two, different characters or situations and and place the rest in books of their own. The way he writes, each could be made into a fascinating tale and the results would be more lucrative for him and a lot more enjoyable for me."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Turtledove is the master of alternative history. I gave this book 4 of 5 stars because it is a solid read that has lots of interesting plots and subplots with decent character development. It lost one star because many of the decisions made by historical characters are not the decisions that I believe they would have made under the circumstances as presented (not being a PhD in history I allow that Turtledove, who is, may know more about this than I)."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"This book is the crown jewel of the Great War Series. The battle scenes were epic, heroes rose and fell. I waited a whole year, from Summer of '99 to Summer of '00 for this book and it was worth the wait! Whenever a Great War book comes out, my life goes on hold until it gets read!This alternate history is so deviated from our own, yet so like our own in many ways.Make sure you read American Front and Walk in Hell first, but then get this one and strap yourself in for a helluva ride!"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"As the title suggests, there are several breakthroughs, on the personal level of Turtledove's characters as well as breakthroughs on the war. The book ends, not with the end of the war, but the side that is victorious is obvious. Think of our World War I during the middle of 1918 and you'll understand. A good book even with all the characters(some you like, some you don't) switching views so the book doesn't quite focus on plot development for the single character."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I've liked almost all of Harry's books, but when I finished this one, it seemed a little fishy to me. So I mailed the three books in the series so far to my Dad to read, since he knows more about WWI than anyone has a right to if they weren't actually in it. That turned out to be a mistake, as he read them all over one weekend, called me on the phone, and spent about five hours of long distance time venting and rattling off this huge laundry list of how and why what Turtledove presented in his book couldn't possibly have happened (even assuming the differences between Harry's world and ours). It seems to me if you're going to write alternate history, it should still be realistic enough not to give a historian fits.I also agree with what one other reviewer wrote (and this is the part that bothered me when I first read the book) in that the characters and story all seem coerced and stiff, like the events in the novel are being forced to fit a mold.And I agree with what just about everyone has written - the sex scenes are poorly done. I like to see romance bloom between characters - but I didn't see any of that.Personally, I think Harry is spending too much time concentrating on his Colonization story. Maybe he should have waited until the Great War series was done, so he could devote some more time to researching the war."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I'm not gonna say much about the end, because it would ruin it for anybody who hasn't read it yet, but I felt that this was one of the better books he had written. Several things that had been cloudy in the previous books came to surface, along with reasons for earlier criticisms. Such as the reason for two Canadian views, different trech warfare views and different black views. Although once again he did have multiple characters, in this book the transitions were much nicer, and he did a good job of bringing them together. TR was also featured much more promonitly in this book, and I felt that was much more interesting as well. All in all, it was very well written, and I look forward to the fourth book in the series."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"\\"Breakthroughs\\" is the third - and finally - final book of Harry Turtledove's \\"The Great War\\" trilogy. To recap where we are in this series: the trilogy is an outgrowth of a single book: \\"How Few Remain\\". This book really made me want to read the trilogy because the premise and characters; especially General Custer; were wonderfully drawn. This book wrought the Great War trilogy: 1) American Front, 2) Walk in Hell, and 3) Breakthroughs. The first two in the trilogy were disappointing but this third one recaptures the promise of \\"How Few Remain\\". This final book completes the apparently never ending story of nasty Southerners, displaced Mexicans, incompetent Northern officers and feisty Canadians reappear who NEVER died! As with the first book, by the end of this one you will wish that the carnage had been more complete - you pray for the invention of the atomic bomb to end all of civilization but there are no more volumes to go.It you are like me and want to make sure that you start at the beginning of an author's work and read through to the end, no matter how many volumes, this third volume renews your style. I have read the entire trilogy and even though I really liked this volume the best, my bottom line has not changed. Take this trilogy to the beach, mountains or lake and if you have a vacation of rain where you have to be indoors, this trilogy will fill those hours. If you don't finish the trilogy during your vacation, PLEASE leave them for the next humans to inhabit that vacation space.This volume begins, yet again, with George Enos resolving of his Confederate prison camp experience by practicing on an anti-aircraft gun to begin blasting away at Confederate warplanes. Of course, as I look back at the previous two books, it has all been practice! Don't get me wrong, all the character story lines - and there are dozens to keep straight - are interesting. This volume bring to the series vivid pictures of tank battles and aircraft battles reminiscent of the World War i Flying Circus. SO, do these many, many characters finally meet their end? I don't want to spoil you reading pleasure if you have slugged through the first two but the last two sentences of the book say: \\"She (Anne Colleton) looked north, not into the swamp but far beyond. 'We've got the damnyankees to catch up with, after all.'\\" Turtledove's story has NOT ended....If you have gotten through all three of these reviews here's my recommendation: read the prequel to the Trilogy - \\"How Few Remain\\" and the last of the trilogy \\"The Great War: Breakthroughs\\". You won't miss the heart of Turtledove's story."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The south won the civil war (thanks to intervention from France and England) and the U.S. has longed for revenge. Now, allied with Germany in the First World War, it just may have its chance. Brutal trench warfare has bled both the north and south for years, but in Tennessee, General George Armstrong Custer has an original idea--what would happen if he massed his tanks rather than committing them piecemeal according to U.S. military doctrine? The result is the beginning of the end for the outnumbered confederacy. While successful in the south, the U.S. also pushes north against Canada and Britain, its resources near the breaking point already thanks to the German offensives in Europe, can do little to help its embattled Empire--or itself.Author Harry Turtledove is something of a master of the alternative history. Using impressions from soldiers, civilians, sailors, politicians, and officers, Turtledove paints a picture of a believable and human story of war and its consequences. In this alternative history, the Republican party nearly vanished with the loss of the Civil War and socialism took its place as the second party. Red revolution, led by southern blacks, damaged the southern cause enough, at least that they could be blamed for the South's defeat (setting the stage for a World War II sequel with the CSA having its own version of Hitler blaming the defeat on anything the South itself.More convincingly than Turtledove's fantasy retelling of actual history, his alternative histories work. Although it takes a while to get into the story (I was tempted to stop reading after the first hundred pages), the novel is finally rewarding. Turtledove gives an evenhanded and sympathetic account of the sufferings of war. It is easy to sympathize with the North's decision to impose Treaty of Versailles-like consequences on the South, and to sympathize as well with the Southerners who think only to prepare for the next battle.Turtledove's mixture of historical and purely fictional characters is occasionally jarring, but makes for a more convincing story."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The Great War series has been excellent, and this is undoubtedly the best so far! The pace of the action picks _way_ up, and doesn't slow down till the end.I haven't reviewed the previous two books, so I'll start with a few words about the series in general, for the benefit of those who haven't read them. It is set in the same world as Turtledove's earlier (and highly recommended) &quot;How Few Remain&quot;. In this world, the Confederates won the battle of Antietam, and went on to secede from the Union with help from Britain and France. The first book (&quot;The Great War: American Front&quot;) opens up in 1914 with the beginning of World War I. The war in Europe goes much as it did in real life, with Britain, France, and Russia squaring off against Germany and Austro-Hungary. At this point, however, things get more complicated. The CSA is quick to join the war on the side of its old friends, Britain and France. The US is equally quick to join the war on the side of its one European ally, Germany. The result is a bloody, grinding trench war along the US-Confederate and US-Canadian borders, accompanied by battles between the US and British Pacific fleets. Like the real WWI, the result is slow, gory, and not terribly decisive. It is tense and well told, but not much land changes hands.In &quot;The Great War: Breakthroughs&quot;, this changes very quickly. What has long been a war of positions makes the slow but inexorable transformation into a war of mobility.Throughout the series, many new tactics and technologies have been introduced. In this volume, they really begin to pay off. The result is some of the fastest, most exciting military-SF action to be found this year. Airplanes drop increasingly deadly and accurate payloads of bombs, wreaking destruction on both civilian and military targets. The US and it's Latin American allies launch an assault against vital supply lines in the Pacific, hoping to starve Britain into submission. Confederate submarines struggle to break the US Navy through hit-and-run tactics. Artillerymen concoct increasingly nasty chemical weapons. General George Armstrong Custer, long thought useless, finally does some good with his innovative use of barrels (tanks).The result of all this: soldiers are no longer safe in their own trenches, and war will never be the same again. The viewpoint characters must learn to live with this rapidly changing world. As artillery shells fall on Washington, DC, Nellie Semphroch quickly learns that obnoxious men are no longer her biggest concern. Gordon McSweeney, solidly religious but thoroughly bloodthirsty, delivers the Fires of Heaven to the Confederate heathens through the barrel of a flamethrower. George Enos hunts Confederate subs from the deck of the USS Ericsson. Jake Featherston, a stalwart Southern nationalist, turns his battery of howitzers on any who would dare hinder the Confederate war effort. The end result: one whopper of a read! The action never stops, and there's also a decent supply of nasty politics. Since book one, I've been anxiously awaiting the conclusion. The wait is almost up! I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that the war is over by the end of the book (I won't say who wins). I guess book IV will deal with an alternate Treaty of Versailles, which will surely make an interesting conclusion.I don't give books five stars very often, but this one deserves it for sheer entertainment power."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The final book of the Great War trilogy, I was a bit disappointed to see Turtledove stick to his rather annoying habit of mirroring the actual events. In this book, he has basically turned the CSA into the Germany of 1917-1919 that we know. A breakthrough that cannot be plugged up allows an enemy to penetrate deep into the countryside, forcing an armistice. The currency is devaluated, and the disgruntled army is still semi-mobilized waiting to avenge themselves. (If you replace Featherston with Hitler, &quot;Over Open Sights&quot; with &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and the Richmond War Department with Munich Beer Hall and jump ahead approximately 5-10 years, then the last few chapters make more sense.) It is rather evident what the sequel will bring: Jake Featherston as a Hitler-type leader of the CSA, bringing a holocaust on the blacks as &quot;backstabbers&quot; of the Confederacy, with another minor character (probably someone from this series-Major Potter or Jeff Pinkard?)as his Himmler. In the USA, Irving Morrell will have evolved into an advocate of armored warfare, maybe one of the British desert war generals?? However, I must say that Dr. Turtledove's style is intriguing and I can't wait to read his conclusion, especially what he will do with the European situation and where he will place the Battle of Britain."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Book III of Turtledove's &quot;Great War&quot; tetralogy answers most of the questions asked in &quot;American Front&quot; and &quot;Walk in Hell,&quot; while hinting at those to be confronted in Volume IV, settling account.This volume, while very well written, is also the hardest and least optimistic, thus far, of the series: An invitation, perhaps, to carry the &quot;Great War&quot; timeline on to World War II?More than anything, &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; rests on a shaky intellectual basis, as does the rest of the &quot;Great War&quot; series.There are few surprises from Volume II: Tanks, airplanes, poison gas and sheer manpower propel the US-German alliance on to victory while, one after the other, the CSA and its allies must sue for peace. The Americans logically resolve to annex whatever territories they've conquered.Turtledove's character development remains strong even as events become more dramatic. Bigotry and bitterness co-exist in many a heart. Confederate Soldier Jake Featherston, who blames the defeat on blacks and C.S. brass, is a sure candidate to lead a postwar, Nazi-like Ku Klux Klan.Turtledove gives too much treatment to superficial, unpleasant Anne Colleton and her cowardly servant Scipio. But he is at his best when dealing with the defeated: Canadian Farmer Arthur McGregor, who becomes an embittered monster, recoiling at nothing to gain revenge; and one-time C.S. bigot Reggie Bartlett, who actually becomes a better man -no small feat in wartime- as he learns to give blacks a measure of respect. The author's minor literary offenses are not enough to detract from the general quality of the series. But there are too many repetitions, for instance: We don't need to read fifty times that taking Winnipeg from Canada will split that country in two. One reference to &quot;black-bordered casualty lists&quot; in daily newspapers is more than enough. And every family in North America seems to eat chicken stew for dinner, every evening!The major question, as we consider Turtledove's hard, and impoverished world, becomes this: How realistic is his theory in the first place?Turtledove willingly challenges one of the strongest tenets of International Relations Theory: that democracies trade with each other and don't wage war on one another. Would the US so willingly have turned its cannons on France and Britain?Even if the CSA had won the Civil War, would Britain and France so willingly have allied with a slave-holding nation? Would public opinion in either of these countries have stood for this, and for post-1882 apartheid in the American South? Would the United States so willingly become the pupil of Imperial Germany, a nation with doubtful democratic credentials at best?Turtledove's highly entertaining series is a must for anyone with the curiosity to ask &quot;what if..&quot; But it may be no more than that: Great entertainment..."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I was a little skepitcal when I read the first book in this series, 'American Front.' I felt it conatined far too many characters and situations that the overall story would get lost in the shuffle. This fear followed me into the next book, 'Walk in Hell.' Although 'Walk' was a lot better I was worried that Turtledove was missing out on some great ideas with regaurds to the way the European war progressed and also the political aspects of the war in the two Americas. But I am happy to say that the new book in the series, 'Breakthroughs,' addresses these aspects of the war in a wonderful and satisfying way. As the war continues, new tactics are employed that allow the U.S. to force her enemies to seek peace- but that's just the beginning of the troubles that lie ahead, troubles that both Yankees and Rebs simply aren't prepared for. In the north the U.S. must learn to integrate it's hard-won conquests into the union, in the south confederates stuggle to adjust to humiliation and defeat and turtledove even gives a character with disturbing parrellels to Adolf Hitler during his time in the trenches. Far and away the best of the series so far (excluding 'How Few Remain') this is a fun romp through what might have been. Turtldove is once again on top of his game!"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I did the preceding ones, but I was glad to get to the end of it. I found myself reading to find out what happened more than to enjoy the prose and flow of the writing. Too many &quot;reruns&quot; in conversations and plot lines.Being a southerner, I was a bit chagrined at the result of the war - this shouldn't surprise anyone because you should see it coming if you read the other two books. I was more irritated with the obligatory sex scenes (please make them stop!), the charicature characters (McSweeney is particularly annoying), and the perpetual reference to army lieutenant colonels as &quot;Lieutenant Colonel&quot;, contrary to military practice, was also bothersome. Worst of all was the USS Dakota: Sam and his Italian friend have repeated the same conversation throughout all of the books - enough already! Likewise with George Enos and his Chief on the Ericsson.I enjoyed the overall story - Harry Turtledove is a master storyteller, and if you appreciate imagination you will like any of his work. I was pleased that not everyone in the story has a happy ending - war rarely leaves everyone whole and happy! I especially appreciate his attention to detail: I drive on Telfair Street in Augusta, GA every day, and it was interesting to see Scipio stop there in his flight from &quot;Miss Anne&quot;. Now if only I can find that restaurant! (If you read the book you'll know what I'm talking about).Overall, I would recommend this for history buffs, Turtledove fans, and folks that have read the first two &quot;Great War&quot; books."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I usually look forward to Harry Turtledove's &quot;next book&quot; in several of the series that he has running. I particularly like to keep up with various characters that he has developed rather nicely,such as Jake Featherston and Cinncinnatus. At times this book moves along rather well and some of the writing is paticularly inspired,but for the greater part of the book we are simply plodding along from one telegraphed situation to another. Not very satisfying;therefore--2 stars. I thought that the situation in which the CSA found itself in regards to armaments to be a bit odd,considering that their major ally, Great Britain, was one of the World's leading industrial powers...and a naval power! My conclusion regarding this particular &quot;installment&quot; in the neverending saga ,is that it is really a setup for a real doozer of a &quot;Second World War&quot;. The parallel of the CSA being disarmed and occupied,as was Germany at the end of &quot;real-time&quot; W.W.I,is a good teaser for history buffs.Of course the anger, resentment, and the loser's desire for revenge sets up the next war. I suspect that the next book in the series will really make this one an important cornerstone for future developments. The generally flat tone of this book was not very satisfying,but it did leave me wanting more. Overall,this book was a necessary evil in order to further bring Dr. Turtledove's alternate history timeline to completion. I look forward to the next volume with enthusiasm."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Once again Harry Turtledove churns out yet another great crowd-pleaser, wrapping up just one phase of his ongoing alternate American history epic. There's a little something for everybody in this book. The sudden use of blitzkrieging tanks resulting in a lot of hard-fought battles and victories for action buffs to enjoy. More cameos by crazy old General Custer, wily Teddy Roosevelt, a flustered William Howard Tuft, and mention of a young arrogant Douglas MacArthur. Political maneuvering by our favorite Socialist Congresswoman Flora Hamburger. Actual insight into the psyche of our Canadian friends to the north. Finally an overseas plot involving South America and info on how the war really fares in forgotten Europe and Asia. A murder mystery plot resolved with a shock. As well as the tugging of emotions with a few surprise deaths of long-running characters, some will make you cry, others will make you smile in triumph. The only little nit I have is with the continued treatment of Covington, Kentucky in the Cincinnatus plot as a racist Confederate hotbed. I live right next to the city and know it's history. It could just be hometown pride but from what I understand the entire area has always been more Yankee than the southern part of the state any day."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I very much looked forward to this book and read it eagerly. I enjoy the whole concept of an alternative WWI with North vs South, but I couldn't help but be disappointed while I was reading and when I was finished.For one thing, Mr. Turtledove has an annoying habit of making the same point over and over with many of his characters. I'm not talking about re-establishing them for this book for those readers who may not have read the early books in the series. I'm saying that he often replays the same scenario every time he comes back to a character within THIS book, sometimes without really advancing the plot or telling us anything new. Seems like wasted verbiage to me. I keep thinking about the newspaper comic strip &quot;Family Circus&quot;, which is basically five or so concepts repeated over and over with minor variations. I would have preferred for some of these scenes to be combined in order to cut back on the tedious repetition of explanation about a character's motivations.Another gripe: There is very little about events in the rest of the world. I would have enjoyed considerably more detail about the war in Europe and elsewhere. Turtledove has a great imagination and could easily have tossed in some interesting speculation.Nevertheless, it's a good read, and I would recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in alternative history. And, yes, I'll undoubtedly snap up the final volume as soon as it comes out."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The cheerful &quot;isn't-it-great-to-be-a-soldier&quot; song, &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; derives from an older and rather darker tradition, songs with titles like &quot;Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye&quot; and &quot;My Son John&quot; -- bitter songs about young men who came home maimed. But it's the cheerful, cleaned-up versions like &quot;...Marching Home&quot; that those whose interests wars advance want us to remember because, if too many remember &quot;Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye&quot;, the next war will be harder to start.As Turtledove brings his alternate World War One to a close, we can already see the seeds of the next war being sown, both in the specific activities of characters in this book and by parallels to the real history of the world.The treaties forced on the defeated Confederacy, intended to keep the CSA down and make sure it's bever again a threat and, as well, to humiliate it in return for all those years of humiliation that the USA has suffered will certainly bear the same bitter fruit that similar humiliating and devastating terms forced upon Germany bore.Certainly the Red devils (metaphorically) of revolution and politics released during the war will not easily be exprcised so long as the lot of the Black man is not materially improved, and (as another reviewer has pointed out) the embittered artillery Sergeant who has already begun keeping a journal chronicling his struggles and his thoughts on what is wrong with the System will very likely be Important in what is to come...Structurally, this book is pretty much the same as most of Turtledove's alternate history war novels -- the &quot;Worldwar&quot; books and the earlier ones in this series -- being recounted in a series of segments telling the actions and experiences of the members of a large cast of established characters (some entirely fictional, some alternates of real figures in history) whose viewpoints cover virtually all of the actions of the War and of the effects on those civilians who actually encounter its results {sort of like what John Brunner referred to as &quot;Tracking With Closeups&quot; in &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;). The segments vary from quite short vignettes to near-short-story lengths and are not -- in my opinion -- necessarily all equally necessary to advance the story; there is a redundancy here and there that i could have done without.Another problem with the narrative technique that Turtledove has chosen, in my opinion, is that it tends to make it difficult to see the characters as people rather than as labelled cardboard figures. Thus, one is less likely to be less interested in their problems and their fates than one is in the overall sweep of the narrative. (Though, to be fair, that might be to some extent the author's intent.)A problem specific to this book is that, having moved his main character from the Birmingham Alabama area into battle, Turtledove doesn't go back there as much as he had been, and so we aren't seeing what conditions are evolvong there as more and more blacks are working in the mills and foundries, doing white man's work and drawing almost a white man's pay. Now that the whites are coming home, are those blacks going to go peacefully back to where they were before the War?A sustaining enough read, but, as in the Real World, it's just a place to mark time for a while, since the end of the &quot;War To End War&quot; merely sets the stage for the Next World War.Here's a frightening thought, given that in Turtledove's universe WW2 will be, to a major extent, fought between the CSA and the USA on the North American continent -- what if someone develops the atomic bomb?"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"First off I'd like to say that I've liked all of the Turtledove books that I've ever read and this one was just as good or better as all of his other books. I did have some problems with this book and the rest in the series. I always wanted to know what was happening in Europe so that I could see the difference between our world and this one. The only real glimpses we got were in the second book when Verdun fell to the Germans, which held out in our world, and when France and the UK threw in the towel. They mention that Germany created the Kingdom of Poland with land taken from the Russians and that Russia was in Revolution, but that was about it. As for the res though I really enjoyed this book. I found it very interesting the way Custer was very similar to George Patton in this book by wanting to mass his Barrels (Tanks) and some of his sayings were almost direct quotes of Patton. I was surprised at how easily Turtledove has killed some of his major charecters in all three of these books. I was glad to see some go but also sad to see others go. Of course I was cheering for the American-German alliance throughout these books. I think it was east to tell that they were winning the war by the end of the second book. I would have liked to have seen all of the CSA and Canada occupied by the USA and all of France by Imperial Germany but I was glad to see them win. I can see possibilities unfold in the future for the universe and that's part of the reason I enjoy Alternate History and especially Hary Turtledove. It can open your mind to speculating what could have happened. Overall I think this book was very enjoyable. I don't think it was as well written as the others and I was disapointed by how many charecters he killed, but that added to the suprise factor. I am eagerly awaiting the final book in this series as I am awaiting all of Turtledove's books."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Up until Breakthroughs, Turtledove's treatment of the Great War makes sense. Despite the US/CSA rupture, events in Europe continued as they have in our timeline and an assassination in Sarajevo triggers global conflict. The glimpses we were given of the European fronts showed that the war was carrying on much as we would expect.In our history, the stalemate in the west broke only after the US began to supply the Allies with troops and material, in early 1918. US support was critical to the Allied effort as Russia was out of the war and Germany was free to transfer forces from the East to the West. In Turtedove's world, however, the Allied collapse comes *before* Russia's collapse. How? Why? And why is there no mention of the events in Russia? Surely the rise of the Bolsheviks would resonate with Flora Hamburger. (And while we're at it, why wasn't Trotsky in New York when the war began as he was in our history?)Unfortunately, I had so keenly been looking forward to the Bolshevik Revolution rekindling the socialist movement in the US/CSA that it's lack detracted greatly from the rest of the book. Beyond that, Turtledove's insistence of following a dozen characters four pages at a time continues to be annoying, however each storyline is entertaining and at times moving."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"...was a travelling exhibit of antique aircraft. But to the John Jakes of what-if, it could have been real. The America of this story is a pair of third-world nations being supplied by two different superpowers--the Union gets their planes from the Germans and the Confederacy gets theirs from the British. Snoopy's Sopwith fighter is flown by Johnny Reb! I find it a poignant irony to be caught in the middle of this book by the World Trade Center attack on September 11 2001. Of all the books to be reading--a war book, even a fantasy one. This whole series has brought some strange perspectives on early 20th Century America. Southern black people going Communist--I thought that was a Ku Klux Klan fantasy about the Civil Rights struggle. But you get the wierd spectacle of Amos and Andy-style pronunciation of the canned Marxist jargon. Turtledove reminds us, though, that a lovely educated young Congresswoman of the Socialist persuasion doesn't really understand fully the very same rhetoric she herself is parroting. Blind zealotry knows no social or racial barriers, I guess. I'm lucky that I'm too much of a skeptic and cynic to be knee-jerk about my own ideologies--there but for the Grace of God go I! A wounded white Confederate soldier, a wounded black Confederate soldier and several wounded Union soldiers all wind up in the same hospital ward--talk about a micro-war in one room! But within a few days all of these men become introspective and self-analytical enough to be able shoot the bull like any bunch of fighting men. None of them has lost his prejudices, but they end up all treating each other like men. Hollywood is full of stories where a bunch of people magically overcome all of their biases before the end credits, which is naiive. I like Turtledove's treatment here of that issue much better--you have to walk before you can run."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"A good story (or rather multiplicity of stories) told on a broad canvas. However, what fascinates me and what will make me buy the next series is the ingenious plot twist of a Confederate noncom veteran, embittered by an armistice and with a major axe to grind against both the powers that be and a minority race which he sees as the cause of most of the problems, deciding to go into politics in a minority party of which absolutely nobody has ever heard and discovering a talent for spellbinding, rabble-rousing oratory. Now, this could clearly never happen, to say, an Austrian noncom - could it? - but it's clever."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"As a book store owner, I get to become jaded to fiction. I get to look at every new book that hits the shelves, and 95% of the time I am simply not impressed. Harry Turtledove is one of the few authors I own everything by. From his Fantasy writing, to his Alternative History books, he is solid reading. f you are looking for something different, Harry Turtledove is your man. In this his latest book in the WWI series, he has put together a book, I personally wish never ended. I have become attached to several of the characters, and hate waiting for the next book. Yes Harry does at times seem to follow the actual events too much, but then again if he just went off into the blue sky, it would lose its ability to be believed. All of the things in his books are believable, as are his characters. I recommend him highly, for history and fictions readers alike.."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I've read all of Turtledove's alternate history novels, and this is by far one of the best. Volume III has a much faster pace than the first two volumes. More happens in this book than the first two combined. Turtledove still spends too much time with the arrogant and annoying Anne Colleton and her spineless former butler Scipio.Gordon McSweeney is also a huge bore at times. Other than that the characters are all interesting,especially Jake Featherston, Arthur McGregor and M. Galtier. The battle scenes are great as usual, especially the ones involving Custer and Col. Morrell on the Tennessee front. Most of the plotlines from books I-II are resolved here. Therefore, Book IV:Settling Accounts will resolve the remaining plotlines and may be a semi-introduction to a WWII storyline. Several hints saying as much were found in this book. Faetherston is obviously becoming a Hitler-like character, possibly leading a postwar Nazi-like Confederacy. There was also a reference to a possible rift between the USA and Imperial Germany. The worst thing about this book is we have to wait another year for Volume IV. This is clearly one of Turtledove's best works and would be great if he couninued the series into WWII."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I was hoping Breakthroughs would be better than its predecessors, and I was not disappointed. By now I was familiar with all the characters and I found all their stories interesting. Jake Featherston, in particular, is becoming more and more interesting, as his bitterness towards the Confederate nation's ruling classes and its black population is intensifying. Especially, as he sees the way the War is going down the toilet for the Confederacy. He also seems to be taking down notes of all the inadequacies of the Confedrate war effort, an alternate Mein Kampf perhaps? We also witness Occupied-Canadian Arthur Macgregor carrying out a long list of terrorist activities against the occupying US forces. We also see General Custer put his Barrel (Tank) doctrine to good use in the US campaign in Tennessee, and an amusing argument between him and 'Teddy' Roosevelt towards the end of the book. Its a pity that two of the characters, on the Union side, were killed off in the last 100 pages! As they were hardly the most boring characters in the series and it would have been good to have seen them survive the war, after all they had been through! Anne Colleton keeps us entertained in hunting down the Red insurgents in the swamps of South Carolina, in order to avenge her brother Jacob. I have to echo the opinion of others, that Turtledove should give us some more information regarding the war in Europe. Maybe, there will be more information in the next book, in dealing with an alternate Versailles Treaty! All in all, a 1st class read and I can't wait for the next installment in this great series, and inevitable World War 2 series after that!"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I've been a fan of Turtledove since his World War series came out years ago, and I've read every alternate history book by him since. I loved the Great War series simply based off the first two novels, and love it even more now that Breakthroughs has come out. Breakthroughs is an amazing book. The action is simply incredible, and I love the use of foreshadowing and the possible linking some of the characters to historical figures in our timeline (Featherston as a young Hitler, Morrel as a Patton/Rommel like-figure, Cartsen/Moss as Billy Mitchell-like figures(?), etc.) I like how Turtledove hints at &quot;the next war&quot; (possible other series?) and also has the characters engaging in &quot;might-have-beens&quot; such as if the US had won the War of Secession. Even though I'm sure that Settling Accounts, the fourth and final book in the series, will not have as much action, it will be very interesting to see the consequences of the mistakes made by USA and Germany in ending the war. I absolutely adore this book and recommend it to anyone interested in the Civil War/World War I/World War II."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Although Harry Turtledove is probably best known for his World War series, the Civil War series that began with HOW FEW REMAIN is doubtless his greatest work. The back-story for this series is a plausible world in which Lee's plans for the 1862 invasion of Pennsylvania did not fall into Union hands. After battles at New Cumberland and Camp Hill in which Lee crushed the Army of the Potomac, leaving Washington cut off, England and France intervene--forcing the North to sue for peace. In HOW FEW REMAIN, the story picked up in 1881 when the North declared war on the Confederacy following the latter's purchase of Chihuahua and Sonora from the Empire of Mexico. Following another British and French intervention, the Confederacy was again victorious. The Union is left embittered and hungry for revenge. At the end of HOW FEW REMAIN, Turtledove foreshadowed the four volume GREAT WAR with clear hints of an emerging alliance between the Union and Imperial Germany. In AMERICAN FRONT, the story picked up in 1914. World War I has broken out in Europe. The Union and Imperial Germany are staunch allies, while the Confederacy remains allied with England and France. In short order, the Union and the Confederacy plunge into a war paralleling that in Europe. The war doesn't make a lot of sense. In World War I, all of the European players had clear war aims. The war turned out to be a tragic folly, but they all knew why they went to war. In contrast, it's not clear why the Union and Confederacy are fighting (old animosities?) or what their respective war aims are. Does the USA believe it can conquer and reabsorb the Confederacy? Perhaps this is Turtledove's point - the utter folly of war. If so, his story powerfully illustrates the utility of George Washington's advice that the US steer clear of &quot;entangling alliances&quot; with European powers. As was made even more clear in volume 2, WALK IN HELL, privation and radical social change are the war's only sure outcome.Volume 3, BREAKTHROUGHS, brings the story forward into 1917. As usual with Turtledove, there are a lot of sub-plots to keep track of - at least a dozen! Crib notes are almost a necessity. Yet, some plot lines that in prior novels seemed needlessly duplicative now begin to show clear distinctions. Consider the McGregor and Galtier sub-plots. Both are based around oppressed Canadian families living in territories occupied by US forces. The McGregors are resistance fighters, while the Galtiers fell (more or less by accident) into being collaborationists. I still think Turtledove, however, would have done better to combine these separate plot lines into a single one, in which the conflict could have been established within a single family, heightening the tension.Without revealing too many spoilers, I want to note that a couple of predictions made by this reviewer's comments on prior volumes have come true. First, Turtledove still cannot write sex scenes but persists in foisting a couple on us per novel. The cuckoldry of one of the viewpoint characters is certainly the sort of thing that happens in wartime, but Turtledove's turgid purple prose is still off-putting. Second, as I predicted, Jake Featherston has clearly emerged as a proto-Hitler. So now for my next predictions: The final volume will develop themes of economic privation and social breakdown (think Weimar Germany). A major theme will be Featherston's rise to power as a racist demagogic leader planning a pogrom against blacks. And we'll be buying yet another tetralogy-this time dealing with WWII.The next tetralogy likely will end in southern defeat, although maybe not reunification. In creating the GREAT WAR world, Turtledove thus far has stuck pretty close to the plot line of the Franco-German wars, with the Union playing France's role and the Confederacy that of Germany. In HOW FEW REMAIN, the Confederacy won a short war pretty easily, just as the Kaiser on the Franco-Prussian war. In the GREAT WAR, the south will lose a bloody war, just as the German Empire lost WWI. If Turtledove sticks to form, the south will lose the next war too.Anyway, this is alternative history at its finest. Turtledove is not the greatest stylist in fantasy, and spreads himself too thin across too many books for real quality, but he is a consistently imaginative and capable storyteller. He has the guts to kill off major viewpoint characters, which few other series authors do. One becomes invested in the story and eager to find out how it comes out. Recommended, although U subtract one star for the awful sex scenes."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"If I wanted to read an accurate history, I'd check out the reference section. While Mr. Turtledove's premises may be a little thin (I sincerely doubt the CSA could have won the Civil War even if McClelland hadn't had Lee's plans for his first invasion of the North), he tells a very interesting story, carrying it to it's logical conclusion given the &quot;facts&quot;. He personalizes aspects of the story while effectively tying these aspects into the big piture. While following several different sub-stories as they weave together may be a little much at times, he leaves me always wanting more, and I found this installment in the series the hardest to put down yet. I can't wait to see how WWII plays out in this alternate reality (maybe aliens will show up?)."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Breakthroughs wraps up the story of WWI as fought on American soil and at risk of giving away the ending: the US wins. Turtledove brings closure to most of the stories he has woven into the war. Some end well, others in tragedy. There were some very interesting twists and turns, not the least of which is that General Custer turns out to be the hero of the war. He also sets many of the cast up for their part in the American Empire series which follows. The main complaint I have about Breakthroughs (and the entire series in general) is Turtledove's need to rehash the core point of each story as he switches back and forth between them. In theory one could read any of the books independently, but I don't think he should have wasted the space rehashing every little thing that happened in the first two novels over and over again."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Well as the title suggested the breakthroughs came. Mass concentration of armor proved to be the key to breaking the stalemate of trench warfare. Furthermore, the factors of better industrial base, more manpower and resources began to tell on the Quadruple Entente(Britain,France, Russia and CSA) in the long war. Now the war is over and the peace remains to be hashed out. The questions linger what kind of peace will there be ? That is what the great thing about this book was, it raised more disturbing questions, while the simple questions were progressively answered through the book.The clean, yet tragic, war was ending and a new ugly kind of warfare was being born. War was being fomented on the streets, before the peace had been settled. Turtledove has nicely woven these complex questions into this book, which is definitely the climactic moment of The Great War series. I must agree with some of the other reviewers about the unnecessry sex scenes which only detract from the serious reading.Nonetheless, I would enthusiastically recommend the book to any fan of history/ alternative history. The book is fast paced and there are many surprises in the book as multiple great characters fall. The next book, which I eagerly anticipate, will further outline the face of the peace to be imposed by the victors. It will explore the themes of hatred, bigotry and sense of betrayal in the CSA which will surely result in another war, a nasty, brutal and merciless war. The next book will surely outline the birth of the impending holocaust to come."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Personally, I thought this was another great Turtledove book. I love how he twists history into these alternate images, for they are the way things could have ended. I think Turteldove is a great writer and it's sad to see that everytime a good book like &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; comes out that people have to snipe at it and criticize it for not being perfect. Im no high-minded history professor who knows the shoe size of every soldier who fought in WWI, but I know enough to imagine that Turtledove knows his history as well as can be expected. That's the biggest thing in his books, imagination. All it takes is a little imagination and these stories really come alive, that's how I see it. &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; really moves too, it doesn't seem to bog down and has several twists in the plot to keep you reading all the way to the end. The characters are still numerous and several of them stand out in this novel, such as Jake Featherston, the disgruntled Confederate artilleryman and Irving Morell, a U.S. colonel who becomes a barrel commander and is my favorite character from the series, he's intelligent and I see him (as well as Featherston) becoming major players in the next story. It would be nice to see more information on the war as it happened in Europe, but I think that would sort of be like telling it how it really happened, since this is alternate history, it probably is better if the story is not so embroiled in the war in Europe. Imagining it happening in your backyard and directly effecting you... It adds a new flavor to the situation.

The books have their lengths but also moments where you can't put them down even though it's 3 a.m."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"With the final book of the Great War trilogy, we begin to see a repeat of what happened in our timeline World War I begins in the America&#8217;s &#8211; the USA and the CSA. The CSA has lost the war and as what happened to Germany of 1917-1919 (OTL) happens here. You have hyperinflation taking place and the shocked army of the once great CSA is dispersed leaving all those that served disgruntles, showing signs of a Hitler rising from those ranks. And since the Red Uprising is seen as the main reason the CSA lost, we begin to see those of the south eyeing the &#8216;negroes&#8217; as backstabbers as did the German&#8217;s began to see the Jews after World War I (Our Time Line). All in all it is a real mirroring of what happened in our own Europe and looks to grow into the next trilogy. I think you will enjoy it, even though it leaves you asking several questions. Is Socialism the new force in the USA? Will the CSA become the new Nazi Germany of this fictional universe?"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Harry Turtledove is friggin' brilliant. By that I mean, he wipes the floor with every other author who has attempted alternate history fiction. It's not just his incredible knowledge of history -- he can weave the POV's of several characters together seamlessly into a rich tapestry without losing sight of the larger story arcs and themes of the world stage; most authors would either get wrapped up with the grand heroes of the bigger picture and forget the stories of \\"lesser\\" people, or would hyperfocus on one or two individuals to the exclusion of all else. Turtledove puts it all together and makes you forget that Lincoln was really assassinated and that Custer ever had a last stand.I could go into a lengthy explanation of the details that led up to this alternate WW1 timeline, but lulling you into sleepytime on your sandwich plate would defeat the purpose of a \\"helpful\\" review, so in summary: In this alternate history, the South had won the Civil War, resulting in a new country called the Confederate States of America whose northern border begins roughly at our Mason/Dixie line. Then of course both the USA and the CSA expanded their territores to the Pacific Ocean, fought a Second Mexican War over it, and once again the CSA proved victorious. The United States of America now stands as a humiliated nation with only one ally -- Germany -- and sandwiched between top and bottom by hostile forces. A bleak start compared to World War One as we know it, right?The Great War trilogy began with a mishmash of European politics taking a parallel course to what actually happened in our timeline. The USA then jumps into the war on the side of Germany of course, with the CSA allied with Canada, France, and Britain. The USA has a heavy score to settle from its two previous dustups with the CSA, and so the revenge motive is no small part of what drives the troops onward (they still refer to one another as \\"Rebs\\" and \\"Damnyankees\\" after 50 years). But nations are also made up of individuals, and their passions and memories play into the rising Socialist movements in both countries. How the CSA's shameful past of slavery and ongoing present of deep prejudice against the blacks plays now in the Great War, is perhaps the most satisfying story arc of the series.The technology of the times keeps pace approximately with our real history, so this war has airplanes, tanks (called barrels here), chemical weapons, submarines, and electricity powering homes and cities. An aging General Custer commands the U.S. First Army, and up until the third book of the trilogy, seems confounded by modern chemical warfare tactics -- he still romanticizes the heydays of the cavalry and the sabre. Unexpectedly, he has an epiphany--why not use the \\"barrels\\" against doctrine, to break through enemy lines? Actually, this \\"aha\\" moment is supported heavily by a few of his savvier underlings' counsel..some of the funnier moments come from the thoughts and insights of his aide, Major Dowling. The war at sea is also exposed through points of view of minor players, and the air battles above Canada have that thrill of real-time manoevers. It's education disguised as entertainment; having read this fake history of WW1, I have a better idea of the workings of the real Great War.Author Harry Turtledove is just okay when it comes to character-building skills, and this is an area in which the trilogy could have stood some improvement. Each person, whether legendary or everyday \\"nobodies\\", seems to have an overpowering personality trait that defines their characters-- Jake Featherstone's injured pride, Custer's vanity, McGregor's hatred, McSweeny's fanaticism, Flora Hamburger's political idealism. He has also been criticized for repeating himself, and I have to admit, this tendency does detract from the narrative. Yes, characters do have many recap thought paragraphs, I think to help the reader remember from previous chapters -- this could be solved with a character glossary in the back, instead of having Nellie Semproch for instance recalling again and again her \\"sordid\\" past which she is trying to outlive, or Cincinnatus recapping in his head how he got to be in a compromising position between the CSA and the USA. We also don't have to hear with every new Kimball section how much he thinks Anne is a \\"hell of a woman\\". We get it, she's the Scarlett O'Hara of the Turtledove Universe, but she gets to wear on the readers a bit heavily with the heavyhanded portrayal of her feistiness and indomitable will.For world-building skills however, this author really can't be beat. This never-happened WW1 universe is a live and complex system, fleshed out perfectly in details and large-scope interactions. If you are able to keep track of each little story arc thread throughout three books, you will be rewarded in this final book, Breakthroughs, with a faster pace and a satisfying wrap-up. There are also a few threads left dangling, all the better to lead in later with the American Empire trilogy.I finished Breakthroughs feeling interested in continuing on to the next trilogy -- after a break with lighter reading. It's like digesting a heavy meal, and each one is a large time committment. Recommended for those long winter afternoons when everybody else is out shopping."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"My review is the same for all books of the series. Decent story, a little slow, but also one of the most annoying series becuase he repeats things over and over. Examples are that southern tobacco is way better that northern and northern smokes taste terrible. Also,this black guy was former butler who worked for this white rich lady and was taught to talk like an educated white man and details about his time there. Many more things like this, so just about anytime a soldier smokes in these books( about 100 times) you have to hear about the tobacco, etc. Each character has something told about them over and over and over and over and over, see how annoying that is. These irritating things are just minor pains right now, it continues though and is very tiring to read."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Now here's where TL-191 pays off! I loved this book.The US and CS have been at war for two years and change. As of the beginning of the book it's still a stalemate, but it's getting harder and harder for the CS to keep up. This is because, unlike in the first two rounds of their multigenerational grudge match, the US has stayed in the field long enough to bring the advantages its size gives it to bear, and the US is now winning a war of attrition. The Confeds are slowly but surely falling back as the front moves deeper into their territory. (Same story in the US invasions of Canada--Canada is getting less British help as the situation in Europe grows more desperate for the Entente, with Russia dropping out of the fight, French soldiers mutinying, the Irish rising up against the British, and German innovation benefiting from partnership with the US.) The war is still dragging on, but the stalemate is clearly over.Then the US begins its last major offensive. Custer, who's been a stupid blowhard to this point, realizes he can use massed armored columns to force breakthroughs in the Confed line (hence the title). He finds in Irving Morrell, happy to get back into the field after time spent on the General Staff and lead the armored assault, a man after his own heart. Success in Tennessee leads to the once-forbidden tactics being employed elsewhere, and the Confed position becomes untenable. The Rebs get pushed back on every front and also get forced out of the US. (Washington is retaken after weeks of heavy US bombardment--of course, when victory is in sight the first thing you do is slaughter your own citizens--and Nellie kills Bill Reach, who is trying to rape her while she forages for supplies. Oh, and the bombardment begins at the very minute Edna Semphroch was about to marry a Rebel officer--she'd been literally sleeping with the enemy.) Then a counterattack into northern Virginia is launched. It's about to link up with the offensive in western Virginia the US had been pushing all along, and at this point the Rebels raise the white flag--much to the fury of Featherston, who'd been writing his \\"memoirs\\" ie complaining about how much he hated everyone (foreshadowing his Hitleresque fate) and Roger Kimball, who ignores orders to surrender and torpedoes the ship on which George Enos is serving. The heretofore lucky George won't come back from this one, folks. McSweeney also gets killed, thankfully--He was so tiresome.After the Rebs go down (France had already fallen) it's just a fight against the British Empire. The US creates an independent Quebecois government and all the Central Powers governments extend it diplomatic recognition, including the also newly independent nations of Ireland and Poland. (The Pope seems to be pleased at three new Catholic countries being liberated from Protestant and Orthodox empires, as evidenced by his rewarding Pascal Talon for collaborating with the US by making him a bishop of a newly created diocese.) Here's one thing I liked about the war in this series: It's a diplomatic as well as a military conflict. Both sides actively recruit new allies throughout. By contrast, in the real World War I Germany and Austria-Hungary managed to add only Turkey and Bulgaria to the fold.This diplomatic conflict also means there's a war in South America. Argentina has long been an Entente country, and toward the end its grain shipments to the British Isles are the only things letting Britain continue the fight against the Central Powers. So the CP recruit Brazil into the fight and a US, Brazilian, and Chilean armada is about to fight an Anglo-Argentine one in the South Atlantic when Britain surrenders.So the US finally has its vengeance. A Versailles-esque peace is imposed on the CS. The US isn't in position to force such things on Britain, but it does get to occupy Canada, Bermuda, and the Bahamas. Wonderful scenes of characters celebrating the long-awaited victory. (Nellie gets a medal for her contributions to the spy ring. Since Emily Pinkard is not a US citizen and is beyond Philadelphia's jurisdiction, Edna gets the Sleeparound Sue Award. Nothing for Hal Jacobs, who really was heroic, but that will be rectified later.) The reader shares in the sense of triumph, but is still aware of the heavy cost. Sylvia's widowhood serves to remind us of that.And on the other side of the border, Confederates stew in their own juices and plan their revenge. As Anne Colleton says in the book's last sentence, \\"We've got the damnyankees to catch up with, after all.\\"The ending is satisfying and a reader could stop here if he wanted to. (There's some ugly writing down the line, I must warn you.) However, it also leads quite naturally into the rest of the series, when it's the CS that practices revanchism. This book is able to be simultaneously both conclusion and transition for more story. That's a rare feat for a book. That's why I'd almost say Breakthroughs transcends literature and feels as authentic as real life."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The book was shipped the next day and received in excellent condition. Very satisfied and will order from this company again."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"This entire series was inventive, informative, and entertaining. The fake world war on American soil captures the drama and carnage of the real one. In a way it makes the idea of a world war more real to the American reader because no man's land is in Virginia, Richmond gets air raided, Washington D.C. gets shelled to bits and fierce fighting takes place all over the Mason Dixon in places that we recognize. The characters that Turtledove follows throughout the conflict cover the entire geographic and class spectrum, and through them we watch the war and its effect on different people, and Turtledove is a suprising master at making his characters powerfully evoke sympathy or outrage from his readers. Somewhere on the dust jacket in one of the books in this series it says that this alternate history helps us to understand the real history better. I agree. The major detraction for me in the stories were characters making strangely prescient statements about the future of military technology and world events. But overall this series is enjoyable and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"In this Alternate Universe, the Union lost the battle of Antietiem and thus the Civil War. In Turtledove's &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, the CSA and the USA fight a second war. The USA losses and becomes very good friends with Germany. Now jump to the &quot;The Great War&quot; series.World War I has going on. Of course, the CSA is allied with England and France, while the USA is allied with Germany. Thus the USA is flighting the CSA and Canada in two fronts and battles in the seas. In &quot;Walk in Hell.&quot; the CSA advance into the north has is halted and the USA finally starts pushing the CSA back, even though the Red rebellion has been put down.We get to see the war through the eyes of those who fight the war and those who have to live through it. From the privates fighting on the ground to the seaman playing cat and mouse with submarine warfare to the flyers of the new areoplane and to those behind, the women who fight for their land or families and one who is now a Congresswoman. And more.Although, the book is excellent, I have two gripes with it. First, Turtle uses too many characters for my taste. I know it helps to convey all aspects of the war, but at times I was backtracking a bit, due to confusing characters. My second fault is with this book in particular. I know American's can take an idea and run with it, but the USA's use of barrels - tanks - seemed excessive.Now for the fourth book, they've survived the war, but can they survive the peace?"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"This was the first time I had read an alternate history novel. The idea behind it was fine yet Turtledove switched so much between differnt stories that no one story had much depth and feeling to it. The mini stories, though trying to get a feel from all sides of a war, were superfically set up. There were some characters i wanted Turtledove to go more depth in and others i felt he could have elimintated. The ending of the novel was were the climax was for most characters. I also didnt like how at the end a lot of characters were left hanging. Overall I wasnt that pleased with the way Turtledove wrote about the experiences of war."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"As always turtledove forces you to chase every page.He follows his theme of US versus Confederate States of America rememberance. Remembererance refers the peace imposed by Britain and France on the US to sue for peace.Specifically, each time the US and CSA have fought, the Confederate Stats have won. In the Turtledove world Abe Lincoln was not assasinated and indeed he started the sociaist party. The US is allied with Kaiser Wilhem andthe Confederates with France and Great Britain.Teddy Rooselvelt is the US President. The fascination with Turtledove is the level of detail each of his characters maintains. From every day soldiers, officers, civilians and politicians. Turtledove is a delightful addiction. You always impatiently wait for the next installment"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"What is most striking about the Great War series, and is brought home in Breakthroughs, is that a world where there is no single United States (Turtledove consistently matches &quot;United States&quot; with the plural of verbs) is one where there is no single force consistently believing in progress.In this world, the United States is not only more regimented (brought out by all the various Boards and forms that rule over everyday lives), but also by the attitude of the people. Certainly, we don't expect the Southerners in this universe to believe much in progress. If anything, they are anti-progress, fighting tooth and nail against changes in society.What is striking, though, is the extent to which the United States, too, is mired in the past. From the description of Remembrance Day in American Front, to the statue of Remembrance on Bedloe's Island in Walk in Hell, to the revanchist sentiments everywhere in the US in Breakthroughs, this is an America that cannot let go of the past. Nor should it, given that in that past, it was sundered apart. Unfortunately, it is also one that has few hopes for the future, either.Unfortunately, the writing is inflated (did it really require three books and How Few Remain to get to this stage?). But for capturing the milieu, ethos, and fundamentally changed nature of a different America, this is an excellent series."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The book fails on a couple of different point on being good alternate history fiction: does not account for the economic impact of the Union and Confederacy being under imminent threat, the length of the border would have made trench warfare along the length impossible, logistical issues were pretty much overlooked, early tanks were not particularly effective, effective anti-tank weapons were available quickly after the introduction of the tank, and the South had historically been a lot more military (army) orientation than the North, so would have been much more effective. The warfare described would have been practical maybe 20 years later, but the modern weapons were just too crude by the time of WWI to be as effective as described: Bombers could not level cities and armies still depended on horses, not trucks until the beginning WWIIOn tanks, if tanks were generally as effective as the story seems to indicate, then the original way the tanks were used would have been as effective as combining them (the South appears to have had no way to counter the tank). However, tanks were unreliable (third did not even make into the battle), underpowered (would easily get stuck). In addition the crew would be deaf and effectively blind (vision slots provide little visibility), and the lack of suspension would make MG fire pretty ineffective when moving and dangerous to the crew). At the same time they were very slow, making easy targets for Molotov cocktails, and other thrown weapons. In addition, in WWI the treat of tanks were quickly countered by special rounds anti-tank rifle rounds and then anti-tank rifles. There were also 37mm anti-tank guns (also a WWII weapon) in WWI; during WWII an anti-tank gun would take out 2 tanks of average before being destroyed; the South was on the defensive.Another issue I have is the lack of irregular warfare described. The distances, low population density, wilderness, criticality of logistics in 20th century warfare, and availability of sympathizer would have been contusive to attack. The South very effectively used their superior cavalry in this capacity during the Civil War, and it is unlikely it would not have been a more significant weapon given the how quickly artillery and machineguns used ammunition. Only railroads could have supplied this use quantity, and they would be easy targets. As proven by the Russians during WWII, cavalry could very effectively conduct irregular warfare against the enemy, and affect the outcome of battles.Also the Union or Confederacy would not have been as economically successful as the US; in particular, both government would have been spending heavily on defense, which would drag down the rest of the economy, and discouraged immigration (many immigrants were escaping draft systems in their own countries). Countries like Argentina would have seemed much better alternatives to these immigrants. Also under the economic hardship of high taxes, businesses would have found it harder to survive. Many of the developments in the US during the late 1800s were probably due to the lack of heavy taxes. Also the Union and Confederacy both would have had significant fear of spies, which would have also had a significant impact. This does not even take into account that the two countries combined were more conducive to a successful economy than separated.The Union would not have had the navy that the US had at the start of WWI. Since the Union was in imminent threat on two fronts, emphasis would have been to the army, which for the US was not the case (Canada and Mexico have not been considered a threat to the US for over a century). The navy that the Union had would have had to contend with providing ships to protect the highly vulnerable Philadelphia and New York ports, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi and Ohio rivers (not taking into account the Chesapeake Bay). At the same time, there was no way for these different areas to be able to support one another. Neither the Confederacy nor Canada was in as difficult a position. For the Union, it would have been pretty much impossible to contest the British on the high seas. The Confederacy had a better reason to have an effective Navy due to the long coast line, the Gulf of Mexico, and having interior lines of river communication due to controlling the Mississippi delta. This would not have been like the Civil War since the South would have a Navy with interior lines, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, and a good reason to have a Navy to protect the Gulf. The North would be hard pressed to contest the Gulf of Mexico without controlling islands to provide a base.There are a couple of other issues I have also. The most significant is the amphibious attack where the Union is able to build bridges over a river in a fraction of a day without controlling the opposite bank, and build them to be able to support multiple 30 ton tanks. In 1917, 30 tones was an enormous weight, and building a permanent bridge to handle them would have been a challenge, let alone an assault bridge. Also, it is not just building the bridge, it is building the access to the bridge; even today a lot of the work on building an assault bridge is the access since river banks are treacherous areas, and even tanks cannot just crawl onto a floating bridge. Then there is the river current to deal with (and wind); it is not possible to just add onto a floating bridge when the current is pulling everything downstream with great force. All this time the workers on the bridge would have been exposed to fire; it would have taken little to slaughter the extremely exposed workers. Even against a weak force, no commander would even consider building a bridge without controlling both sides of the river.Then there is a lack of effective defensive mobile warfare, by the South: they started in the right direction, but proved ineffective. I am sorry, but it works extremely effectively on the defense if an army is willing to trade space for time. Even the mostly horse drawn Russians were able to do it during the beginning of WWII against a very mobile German army (a lot more mobile than the Union could have been with primitive tanks and trucks). I doubt the south would have fought any less hard against the Union than the Russians did against the Germans.I wish the Harry Turtledove would do some research before writing a book. If he wanted resources, they are out there: there are many groups interested in simulated war games, and would be happy to help simulate accurate simulations. Harry Turtledove is about the only author in this genre, and he brings up some interesting ideas. Why even bother putting this in the post-Civil War where the South wins if you do not want to investigate what the effect would be. I rate this as high as a I because considering the alternate history is of interest."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Turtledove has been writing too many books lately, and it has shown at times. But not here. He's definitely back on his game in &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; and manages to keep things moving -- but not confused -- through an awful lot of action and scene-shifting. Turtledove also offers gentle moral lessons along the way, without being overwhelming. And I'll be I know who Jake Featherston is going to turn out to be...."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The respect I bore for Turtledove's work evaporated in just one afternoon for two distinct yet commingled reasons.Naturally, any novelist is the sole voice in events which shape the world of the novel. But in a departure from almost all of Turtledove's other works, I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief for more than two, perhaps three paragraphs at a time. The writing seems ponderous, all the events foreordained - as though Turtledove has been swept up in the somewhat disturbing thought processes which occupy the mind of his McSweeney character. Simply put, I knew within the first 10 pages of the book exactly how it would end, and the only surprise I found within the intervening 450+ pages was how terribly coerced the story became. There is not a moment of suspense, not a second of doubt that the book will spiral down to its implausible conclusion.The absolute implausibility of that conclusion is the second and more important reason I gave this book just one star. I won't reveal what happens for fear of spoiling the ending even more than Turtledove has already; but simply put, even the most casual student of the ghastly mistake we now call World War I can easily see it could only have reached Turtledove's conclusion with a novelist's coercive help. Further, the conclusions he draws regarding Houston and part of Texas go beyond the ludicrous and into the shamefully insulting. I could write 10,000 words on this alone, but space prevents me.Mr. Turtledove, please let me know when you get back to doing what you do best - writing an alternative history which very well could happen, rather than one which happens for no apparent reason other than that you seem to want it to. Until then, I'll steer clear of your work."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Dr. Turtledove picks up the pace from &quot;Walk in Hell&quot; with this third novel in the Great War series.As the title indicates we see breakthroughs on the major fronts of action, as well as glimpses into the future of this dark timeline.I still wish Dr. T would get rid of the obligatory sex scene that seems to show up in all of his books... but other than that a great book."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I've always loved history, and I've always enjoyed Harry's books. &quot;Breakthroughs,' though, was a HUGE letdown for me. This whole series hasn't really been his best work, but this one was worse than the two which came before it. I think I'll just stick to the 'Colonization' storyline from now on."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I loved this book mainly because of how the story of a World War I could have been. The story is told from many points of view. Not only that but the events that transpire are believeable and did actually happed (in a wierd way). I know there will be some World War II equivalent in this series. In the book the USA has totally disarmed the CSA (like the real-life Allies did to Germany) and like the real post WWI Germany, inflation is going on overdrive and many soldiers are homeless. Can't wait until the WWII happens."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"This book represents the final volume in Harry Turtledove's trilogy-within-a-tetralogy alternative history series about a world where the United States and Confederate States of America continue to face off against one another decades after the Civil War. After updating readers with the status of all the characters from where they were left at the end of the second volume, Turtledove proceeds to take readers through the final year of the war as seen through their experiences. Their geographical and occupational diversity - from a former steelworker fighting in Texas to a young Socialist congresswoman from New York - gives the reader a good sampling of the war from a variety of perspectives, yet at the same time stressing many of the common experiences of war.While entertaining, however, Turtledove's narrative has lost much of its freshness. While the characters are familiar, as some other reviewers have noted there is a repetition to their accounts that often gives the appearance of treading narrative water. The conclusion of the war helps to break much of this monotony, yet it ends in a way that is clearly a set-up for the subsequent novels, as the characters are being too obviously positioned for the postwar roles that Turtledove expects them to serve. Fans of the earlier novels, though, will find much to enjoy in the familiarity of characters to which they've become attached, as well as the satisfaction of reaching the end of his conceptualization of an alternative \\"Great War.\\""},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Breakthroughs is the fourth book in Turtledove's &quot;Confederates won the Civil War&quot; series, and the third in the &quot;Great War&quot; series based upon that. It's fairly typical Turtledove: nine or ten character threads, researched impeccably, no real plot outside of the passage of events.I like Turtledove's multi-threaded style, but it can get frustrating. The event-driven plot is viewed through almost a dozen characters, who have their own lives and their own adventures; really, it's like more than half a dozen books. I found myself skimming through parts of the book, wanting to see what happened next to X, not really caring about Y or Z. And at times I found myself mixing the characters up.Turtledove is a realist, not a dramatist. With a couple of brief exceptions, the character threads don't mix; one or two of them meet, but there's no convergence point. Events don't turn out as a writer would have them; they turn out as they would in the real world, where good people sometimes die and bad people profit. And where few people are either wholly good or unredeemably bad; this is an author who knows how to paint shades of grey.Overall, a good but not great book. Turtledove's writing isn't the best, but his characterization is first-rate. The overall image, too - of human flotsam being caught in the grand tide of events - is well done. Just one note: this isn't a stand-alone book. Read the first two before you start on Breakthroughs."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"The reader familiar with the previous installments of the Great War series, as well as other alternate history works of Dr. Turtledove, usually looks not for the new content in his work but for the continuation of the story. In a way, it's addictive, like waiting for the next episode of a soap opera to see what happens next. Turtledove remains true to himself in Breakthroughs: multiple story line, emotionally charged scenes on both sides of the trenches, sharp, if sometimes dark, wit, excellent incorporation of actual historical figures into the fictitious history - this and much more is present. But once you finish the last page and close the book, the feeling of foreboding will be hard to avoid; what will become of North America where the exhausted but bitter and vengeful United States, with the principles of democracy and equality providing a window dressing for the more and more German Empire-like administration, finally triumph over not only the Confederacy, but Canada, as well?"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"So the Great War series finally come to an end. Of course, now I have to wait a good long while for the story to continue in the American Empire series. But I'm sure it'll be worth it!Take one simple What If and see where it goes. Start with the initial twist of fate that sets the events of How Few Remain in motion. Suppose that Union forces don't find General Lee's General Order 191 (a far more likely outcome than what did happen quite by improbable accident in our timeline). With the element of surprise intact, Lee wins the battle of Antietam. His swing up into Pennsylvania so he can attack Washington DC from the north succeeds. With position and momentum favoring the Confederacy, England and France make up their minds to ally themselves with the South and force Lincoln to accept secession. And the world is changed utterly.Stepping forward 50 years, the same fatal chain reactions that set World War I into motion in our world also explode in this one, except in Turtledove's alternate history, the Confederacy throws in with its allies, and the Union sides with Germany and Austria-Hungary. And the deadly carnage that ruined Europe in our history washes over North America in this different timeline.The 1800 plus pages of the Great War series make fascinating, compulsive reading. Turtledove's approach is to tell the vast story of this Great War from the personal, limited viewpoints of more than a dozen individuals, rather than either stepping back and giving us the grand author's view of events from above or focusing on a smaller number of lead players. There are pluses and minuses to this. For one, the large number of characters can be confusing to keep track of, at least at first. (I don't think that it's until this third volume that he bothers to give us much at all in the way of physical descriptions of any of them.) And the unvarying psychic distance we have of all their stories, always staying right in limited third person, floating just above their heads, rather than zooming in for something more intimate with just a handful of sympathetic characters or pulling out for a grander, historical vista, can be monotonous at times. But the cumulative effect of this compromise is to communicate both the huge expanse of the story and also to give us a feel for what a World War fought in North America would really be like for an individual caught up in it. He gives us a view from not one but many trenches. And it works. But the cost is that Turtledove never quite achieves either the sweep of history or the vivid highlights of personal storytelling.For me, the Great War series, especially in this final book, also illustrates an important historical lesson. It's what France and England got so terribly wrong after World War I and what the Allies finally got right after World War II. At the end of The Great War, the Confederacy is crushed, the United States vengefully triumphant, and one can see the ruinous peace that is going to be imposed on the South. Just as the wicked and unwise Treaty of Versailles and the devestation it caused in Germany gave Hitler the political and social conditions he needed to come to power, so too you can see a Hitler of the Confederacy arising in this alternative world. (I'm guessing the next series, American Empire, is going to show us just how terrible these consequences are going to be.) So now I can better appreciate the wisdom of all the allies who backed the Marshall Plan and helped to rebuild Europe. There's the lesson. Once you're in a fight, make sure you win and win decisively. (This is something that in this story Congresswoman Flora Hamburger refuses to accept). And once you do make sure it's over by knocking the other guy down so he can't get up, you give him your hand and help him up and make him your friend so you end it right there. In both Turtledove's alternate history and our own, it's a lesson takes a long time and that's learned in blood."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I've been following Turtledove's work for a long time, and have read most of his novels. For the most part I consider him to be one of my favourite authors. However, &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; turned out to be something of a disappointment. There seems to be very little spirit behind the writing this time around; the descriptions are vague and somewhat colorless, and the reader is not made to truly feel any horror, trepidation, or surprise that the setting so powerfully lends itself to. It struck me as being a book that was churned out; something that Turtledove wanted to get out of the way so that he could move on to bigger and better things (understandable when you're working on two other series simultaneously). The major plot devices are clearly marked, and it is made clear after a dozen pages which side is going to win the war. Jack Featherston the artillery sergeant in particular is marked with a flashing neon &quot;PLOT DEVICE&quot; sign. The book wasn't particularly poorly-written, it was just...bland. Turtledove's trademarked constant repitition of points was particularly throbbing towards the end, too, so anybody who gets ill of that quickly should be advised to take some aspirin first. Anyway, in general it was an interesting read, so don't set up the firing squad yet. For me it was mostly of historical interest. If you want to be at all surprised, though, pass this one up and skip to the next book in the series when it comes out; no doubt our good friend Turtledove will be good enough to recite the events of &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; in the next novel...again...and again...and again... ;)"},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"Harry Turtledove's premise in all of his books is that, no matter how the characters may change, the course of history is too strong to be changed significantly by minor events. This is very true in his third installment of his &quot;Great War&quot; tetralogy. Despite the U.S. defeat in the Civil War and the realigning of alliances at the start of the First World War, both the outcome (he who has the greatest means of production and manpower wins) is still the same. And like the Peace of Paris in our own timeline, the peace conditions imposed by the victors are so harsh that they can't help but sow the seeds of a future, more destructive war.Breakthroughs is to titled because of the events that happen on the American Front. By massing armor forces, and not using individually to support infantry as happened in our own WWI, the U.S. has both entered the era of modern warfare and tipped the scales of the North American stalemate. Using a rudamentary form of Blitzkreig (I couldn't help but notice suggestion of the advent of the AIR-ARMOR-INFANTRY combination first introduced by Nazi Germany and now by a German-friendly United States), the U.S. is able to smash through C.S.A. and Canadian lines and force their governments to surrender.But as with the 1919 end of WWI (this war ends in 1917 but at the loss of millions of American lives this time), the Quadruple Alliance has no plans of letting the defeated walk away without paying a heavy price. You can see the bitter resentment of C.S.A. artillerman Jake Featherson (a future Adolf Hitler perhaps?) and the ardant anti-Red Anne Colleton (her pursit of the black communists from the first installment was easily the least interesting parts of this book) playing a role in the fourth and final Turtledove installment.It wouldn't surprise me that a new Axis is formed between the U.K., France and the C.S.A. based on some strange idea of racial or cultural superiority. After all, the ideas of facism finds its roots in nationalism. And France is the country credited with starting that great idea. We can only wait and see how he decided to play this one. The greatest thing about Breakthroughs is that it is action-packed. There is movement on the lines, not just the endless slaughter and occasional death of a character. The reader is really torn about who to support. True, the Americans are defeating the FORMER slaveholders of the South, but those southerners are allowing blacks to enter the military (albeit in a final act of desperation) while the U.S.A. doesn't and is also granting them citizenship. Who is right and who is wrong? Turtledove does not attempt to answer these questions for the reader.It is very clear that, like the final installment of the &quot;Worldwar&quot; series, that he is preparing to begin a new generation of stories in this same timeline. The fates of the characters is resolved and sometimes sealed in this book. There are some who will clearly play a role in the next book, which I suspect will take place about 20 years later, but others will disappear.&quot;The Great War: Breakthroughs&quot; is a fun and quick read. While there are some areas I which he would spend more time on (why couldn't we see what was happening in Richmond the same as we could in D.C.?) and other parts which he should have left alone (who cares about the Dakota prowling around in the south Atlantic? I also resisted the temptation to skip over that tart Anne Colleton's rantings about Scipio and Cassius), it was a good way to conclude the FIRST Great War. But he create a lot of questions as to the future of the divided America that will surely be answered next year."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"This is the third volume of Turtledove's THE GREAT WAR trilogy, and the fourth book in the eleven-book series that began withHow Few Remain.This book chronicles the end of the Great War, and a lot of the characters readers grew familiar with over the course of the trilogy meet untimely ends. Jake Featherston will live on to have a prominent role in the following AMERICAN EMPIRE trilogy that takes place right after the war and into the 20's and 30's. A handful of other characters from THE GREAT WAR will also return.At the end of BREAKTHROUGHS, you can see the parallels between Turtledove's fictitious Great War and the actual outcome of WWI that led to WWII. (Germany reluctantly signed the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919 - even as German leaders publicly rejected its contents.)

Although I enjoyed all the books in the series, this one was the one that I couldn't put down. However, I feel that the book could be improved. The book is written largely as a novel of different people and their experiences with the war. As an Alternate history novel, everyone seems fairly unaware about how the war is going in Europe. I would have prefered that the book be written more like a history book. Somewhere between how this was written and &quot;Fox on the Rhine&quot; (an alternate history novel written like a traditional history book) was written would be good. I would have prefered to know a little more about the &quot;Big Picture&quot; and a little less about the characters sex lives. Perhaps in the next book Mr. Turtledove will introduce a character in the diplomatic service. He left some room for additional characters since he did some last minute &quot;cleaning up the characters&quot;, and a number of characters died at the end of the war. The series is obviously setting itself up for a harsh treaty to end &quot;The Great War&quot; which will set up the next war, I would just ask that the book not be quite so American focused.

The peace treaty imposed on the Confederacy is obviously modelled on the Treaty of Versailles -- and has an even greater potential for cheating. Politically, of course, a victorious Germany on the Continent has profound implications for the future. As in our history, armored breakthroughs end the stalemate of trench warfare. Here the idea comes from an unlikely source: George Armstrong Custer, whose single notable quality, for good or ill, is aggressiveness. A noted variation from our timeline is an earlier linkage of air power with naval power.But the real attraction of the book is to find out what happens to the characters we've followed in earlier books. Some benefit in unexpected ways from war. Some suffer. And some don't survive the war. Some carry on the fight after the armistice, and others begin to prepare for what they believe will be another war between the United States and the Confederacy.The most interesting development is that one embittered Confederate veteran seems on his way to becoming a Hitlerian figure in the series' future."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"When I started to read the last half of this book I could not put it down! (Luckily that was a Sunday...)The end of the awful global conflict could finally be in sight.

Who knows?It is now 1917, and, like Europe and the rest of the world, the war is going nowhere in the Americas. It is a horrible deadlock, thousands and thousands of men from both sides have been killed on land or sea. But no government will give up.And desperate times call for desperate measures. The Confederate States are seriously considering asking for negro army volunteers and the United States are sending so many telegrams to widows that they are not much better off. Then various other nations around the world begin to quit the war or lose, so it becomes clearer that North America could soon be on its own.The protagonists we have come to know and love (or simply acquainted) all relate the closing moments of the worst war this parallel earth has ever seen.

But his writing skills are deteriorating. This would have been a far better story if it had been told largely through the events and the actions of the characters in response to those events. Instead, a lot of the book was spent telling us the thoughts and philosophies of the characters. Turtledove has always had this tendency, but his recent books are worse. And he tells the audience many things which are obvious from context. If his editor had cut the book by 20%, it would have been an improvement. I rate the book 4 stars for plot and characters, but only 2 stars for writing skills."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I would say that this entire series is perfect, and that this was one of the best ending books in an entire series that I have read since the DUNE series. The evolution of the characters was exquisetly written, and the reaction of every nation in subterfuge and open warfare was extremely interesting, and very logically assumed after the changes in history. All in all I would say that this was an extremely good boook and one I couldn't put down. I would recomend this entire series and book to anyone, and cannot wait until the succeeding series arrive."},{"Title":"The Great War: Breakthroughs","review":"I have been waiting for this book to come out since I finished the previous volume. I could not wait to see how things turn out and Turtledove did not disappoint. I enjoyed the book from cover to cover but I have one complaint. Did so MANY of the better characters have to be killed? I got progressively depressed as person after person who I was rooting for get killed off. Harry probably wanted to capture the horrors of war and present that too us. In that he did really well.This book, like the rest in the series, is very easy to follow and is so well thought out that it hardly seems &quot;Alternate&quot;.Thanks Harry. I'm looking forward to the next war.John Silva Chicago, IL"},{"Title":"Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories","review":"If your children love either Isaac Singer or Chelm, look no further than these seven tales. They will treasure the book always, because, as Singer noted in the Foreword to this 1966 volume, \\"In stories time does not vanish. Neither do men and animals. For the writer and his readers the creatures go on living forever. What happened a long time ago is still present.\\" Singer dedicated the stories to \\"children who had no chance to grow up because of stupid wars and cruel persecutions\\" and hoped readers would grow into men and women who \\"love not only their own children but all good children everywhere.\\" It's hard to imagine otherwise.The book opens with a tale called \\"Fool's Paradise,\\" in which Atzel, the son of Kadish grew up with an unheard of disease: He thought himself dead. Lazy by nature, he did nothing at all. His parents tried everything, and finally consulted Dr. Yoetz. After telling his parents to prepare a darkened room to look like paradise, with white satin sheets, the good physician came to examine the young man and pronounced him \\"dead.\\"Delighted with this outcome, Atzel regained his appetite and energy, and remained animated until the next day. When exactly the same food was brought to him a winged angel told him, \\"In paradise, my lord, one always eats the same food.\\" On asking the time of day, he was told \\"In paradise there is neither day nor night.\\"Atzel could not meet with anyone, do anything, see his parents or his beloved, whom he was told was mourning him but would meet another young man and marry him instead. \\"That's how it is with the living.\\" After eight days, Atzel began to see the value of living. He would rather chop wood and carry stones than stay in paradise, and would rather kill himself than stay there forever. At that point, Dr. Yoetz told Atzel he was not dead after all. Upon returning to the land of the living, Atzel married his beloved and became one of the most industrious and productive souls in the region. (Many souls now seeking paradise could benefit from this story.)Not all Singer's fools lived in paradise. Some lived in Chelm, the village of idiots young and old. When it snowed on Hanukkah once, all of Chelm glittered like a silver tablecloth. The moon shone; the stars twinkled; the snow shimmered like pearls and diamonds. And the Elders of Chelm believed that a treasure had fallen from the sky. Rather than trample it, they planned to send a messenger to all the houses to tell the people to stay indoors until the treasure could be harvested. But how could the messenger tell them without himself destroying their riches? Suffice it to say the Chelmnicks ended no richer than they began, but for the laughter they provided to outsiders peering in through Singer's window.My favorite story, though, is not funny at all. In Zlateh the Goat, the last and title tale, Rueven instructed his son Aaron to take his pet to the butcher to pay for the struggling family's Hanukkah celebrations. Heartbroken, the boy nevertheless heeded his father and set out, only to be overtaken by a snowstorm. I cannot tell what happened, except to say that the tale warms hearts to the core.--- Alyssa A.
