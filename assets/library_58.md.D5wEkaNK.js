The good news is that this short book focuses on exact techniques (you can move your tongue up-down, sideways, in circles, figure 8s, etc.) which can be the basis of communication and sharing with your partner. No really new ground here.Everyone sees this book differently, just as they see sex differently. Everyone wants to be a good lover, but some have difficulties.

They share what works for them, but the book serves as a starting point for other couples to explore what works for them. Perhaps this book will continue to inspire couples to refrain from their own sexual rut and achieve mutual satisfaction. Buy this book and consider purchasing a few CD's to enhance your romantic mood--available here at Amazon. Toshi Kubota's \\"Nothing But Your Love\\"--He sings amazing ballads such as Gently, Till She Comes and Shame that celebrate romance, women and satisfaction. (It should have come with this book.)

No book will make you a great lover, especially if you're not interested in what it asks you to do.No, their partners do not cause all of the sexual problems in women, but some can be solved, regardless. This book isn't about pointing fingers in blame. It's about giving pleasure...that's all.This book is a GREAT guide for oral sex, and really only touches lightly on anything else (to avoid redundancy, according to the authors. To paraphrase, \\"many great books have been written on technique in intercourse\\" etc). The authors were very specific in the problems pleasing most women, orally and otherwise. It addresses that all women are different, there's nothing that will work on everyone, and tips on how to find out what your female partner enjoys.Even men (and women) that *think* they know how to satisfy a woman would learn something from this sensitive, well-written book. It's full of sexy secrets that will bring something new to bed...or improve old acts.WARNING!!! THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT PLEASING WOMEN, mostly orally. If you're expecting anything but a book telling you how to UNSELFISHLY please a woman... look elsewhere. I think the title covers that, but some people just don't seem to understand.This is a technical guide on how to cause the female orgasm.Almost every page has artful, but very helpful, illustrations. I also like the *very* open ideas this book supports exploring (anal stimulation, for example).The book is written for men, to use on women, it translates well for women to use on other women, too. The sections discussing penetration with the penis could easily be done with the hands, or device. The oral and hand stimulation sections need no translation.My only true complaint about this book is size. It's a very large book. It's a pretty quick read, and easy to understand, but it won't fit on my bookshelf. It's more of a coffee-table book. What a thrill to your guests if *this* was in your living room.In summary: this book could have been called \\"get her off: a diagrammed tutorial on how to use your mouth, hands, and body to make a woman orgasm\\" but it you'll have to lay it horizontally in your book case."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"I was extremely impressed with this book. As stated by the title, it is a guide to the female orgasm, so it focuses on that instead of intercourse as a whole.It uses tasteful yet very useful illustrations and easy to understand directions. The tips in this book REALLY work and are a wonderful guide for men who really want to maximize their partners pleasure. Not all women are alike so they don't all respond to the same techniques. This book explores a wide array of ideas, and focuses on communication, to find out what a woman really likes.I have read some of the reviews and have found a few negative ones written by men. But if the point of the book is to make a woman come, and the techniques listed in the book work (Do they ever, I'm STILL smiling) and focus on bringing the couple closer together, then how could a negative review be possible? Well, I suppose if a man is only focused on his own pleasure and is of a &quot;get on, get in, get off and get out&quot; mentality, then the book would not be of much use.But as for you fine gentlemen out there who seek to please your partner and fine tune your techniques, I highly recommend this book. A satisfied woman is one who is more likely to spend more time on pleasing you. :)"},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Two reasons make this book worth the purchase:1. It gives emphasis to the idea of the orgasm as part art and part technique. I practiced piano technique for years before I ever became proficient enough to \\"play\\" the piano and forget the technique (consciously). The book enphasizes the idea that technique isn't the answer; the answer is in the art. That idea, the art of orgasm, if caught makes the book valuable.2. The pages on cunniligulus display clear, beautiful, and tasteful descriptions and sketches about how to practice the art in a way better than other books devoted completely to the tongue.I wasn't that interested in the details of Ms Cattrall's life (I don't own a television, never once watched her show, and never found the personal testimony of movie stars convincing) except that she gives convincing testimony that a lover/artist who takes time to learn the instruments (his and his lover's body) can create a new level of pleasure and a new level of understanding. Also, it's probably encouraging for some to know that rich and beautiful doesn't equate with spectacular sex life.The amount of information at first seemed less than the size of the book promised. But, if you enjoy a beautiful book (the feel of it and the sight of it), and if you carefully study the techniques offered in the section on cunnilingulus, THEN if you forget the book and the mechanics of the techniques in the spirit that a pianist forgets the scales--leting his fingers \\"play\\" the instrument, I think you may improve your art and find the book worthwhile.--Charles Runels, MDAuthor of \\"Anytime...for as Long as You Want: Strength, Genius, Libido, and Erection by Integrative Sex Transmutation (A 15-Day Course for Men to Improve Life and Sex)\\""},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"What a wonderful book for a guy to read.

I expect the next 10 years to be much more enjoyable for my wife (and me too) than the last 15. Hoping to go from Good to GREAT!!!!"},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This book, like most books, has some strong and weak points. As one who counsels both individuals and couples and is constantly looking for reading material to recommend, I found this may be a helpful book for some, but the way it is presented may not appeal to everyone. To me, the book came across as rather technical in nature and more like a \\"Mr. Fix-it Manual\\" and for that reason it lost a big star in the rating. We may be talking about \\"home repair\\" here, but there is a big difference between repairing one's sexual activity and repairing a rusty faucet!For many, sexual satisfaction is a natural human response - we all know when something feels good and when it does not. However, for others that spontaneous reaction does not come naturally and for an endless number of reasons. Perhaps it is poor technique, inexperience or past experiences, nervousness, surpressed emotional issues...or maybe the chemistry just isn't right. It takes two to tango! The book provides some helpful tips and techniques from a woman's point of view, and will probably be of primary interest to men, although I am not sure how many men will be enthralled by the rather \\"clinical style\\" in which this book is written. For male readers, you may want to read the book (any information is better than none as long as it is good information.) However, I would then suggest you put the book aside and have a close, intimate discussion with your partner (at the appropriate time please, not as your partner is frantically wheeling the shopping cart up and down the supermarket aisles) and find out just what does please your partner and what does not. Communication is equally important as technique. Sex is a personal, sensitive and individual affair; what pleases one may not please another."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This handsomely illustrated book by Sex in the City's sexually voracious Samantha (Kim Cattrall) and her real life partner (Mark Levinson) is sure to bring long overdue attention to the dearth of female orgasms. For this feat alone I give it 4 stars.Satisfaction wisely emphasizes love, caring, and communication, a framing that will widen its appeal to people uncomfortable about buying sex books. What readers get here is essentially some ideas from one happy couple about what works for them. The book emphasizes oral sex according to a detailed choreography (circle, left-right flick, pause, up-down flick, pause, circle, figure-eight, etc.) which might leave some tongue-tied.There is little about manual technique, presented as an accessory to other activities, even though many women find a hand or two to be the most satisfying method of both G-spot and clitoral stimulation.This book is not big on promoting condom use, and finger cots or gloves and oral dams are totally ignored. The book's grooming tips are emphatic and in good taste, though no substitute for the safer-sex benefits of latex barriers.I wish the book had also promoted the use of lubricant as a staple of good sex rather than as merely a remedy for vaginal dryness.Despite these shortcomings, Satisfaction will get people thinking about how to make sex better and more mutually pleasurable.Is it the best thing that's happened to female sexuality since the vibrator? Not quite, but this couple takes a step (up-flick?) in the right direction."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Thank you so much Kim and Mark for this wonderful explicit book.If you are looking for one single book that will help you improve sexual satisfaction - this is the ONE! In a concise, clear and yet gentle and sensitive manner, the writers guide you through the intimate process of oral sex (and much more), and provide outstanding practical tips & tricks for both men and women.This is a non-nonsense book that offers great information and education, and a tool for communication between couples. It provides excellent insight into the physical and emotional experience, and articulates in a magical way \\"what women want\\". Many of us have struggled with understanding what we want and articulating it to our partners, and this book is a genuine help.I can't wait to share it with my husband :)"},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This book is not exactly what I was expecting. It is almost a technical handbook. Very straightforward in approach. It is definitely a well-written book, and is extremely tastefull in its approach to this subject.The book is written from a womans perspective, and is almost a guidebook for a man.I would say to any man that is interested in learning the art of making love to a woman, that this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"First, let me start out by saying I am no expert in sex and hope not to portray that image in my review. I am going to attempt to write a useful review to those really contemplating on purchasing this book.I bought this for my wife and I. I was hoping to read it with her, perhaps giggle a little and say \\"ohh, we gotta try that\\" but that never came. Fortunately, I don't feel like I lost a lot (only because it didn't cost much). This book is probably most useful to the couples that don't really communicate sexually and especially for those men that are doing the same things and are almost certain it isn't working. Think of its purchase like this. You spend less than $20 to get something new to try. It may work for her, and it may not. But, if your game is already scoring major points or the two of you communicate well enough to explore and find out what works (the best part) leave this one on the shelf. The key to reading the pictures is something you might have to cutout so you can refer to it with forthcoming pictures. Ok, maybe not that bad but the images aren't good (and no we weren't looking for porn). This book is shrink wrapped for two reasons one, for the kids and two for the adults that will skim through and realize it's just plain fluffy.I have to admit Kim plays such an intersting part on Sex in the City I thought this might be worth the purchase. But, that is acting and the book is the real world. Actress she is, author she is not.With all that said,(...) Happy reading to all and I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This book has changed my life. I picked it up on a whim, but I was totally unprepared for what it had to teach me as a woman. I've been sexually active since 1971 and thought I knew everything about my own body's sensations. When my husband tried out some of the ideas in this book..... I was totally amazed, not to mention thrilled. I really appreciate the point the authors make about how a woman should be getting as much satisfaction from a sexual encounter as a man. It has revitalized my marriage. Every man should seriously study this book if he really loves his woman."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Thought the book was written in a very senitive and understanding form.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"I was given this book from my older sons when my wife and I split up and devorced. I studied it and learned everything in it so that when I got with someone else I would be prepared. It worked so well when I got with my beautiful new love of my life, that I handed this book down to my younger son at his bachelor party to study experiment with his new wife. It teaches new techiniques in a classy and loving way. It brings love making back to being fun.....not just porno sex talk."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Warning: this review contains language of an adult nature.This is certainly a book for guys; girls are not invited. Just kidding! But Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm is intended for guys - read the title. Do girls need to know how to give girls orgasms? Well, yes, but that is another matter. The point is guys are not so wise in the ways of giving a girl satisfaction, mainly in the form of an orgasm, or perhaps multiples (contrary to what Jay of Silent Bob fame may indicate). And so the star/slut (?) of Sex in the City has got together with her husband and written a book about satisfying women, since us guys simply seem unable to do it right, and we need a woman to teach us how. But that's okay, because the best way you're going to find out what your girl really likes is by her telling you. Well, now you can surprise her by buying and reading this book.The book begins with some basic introductions from each of them touching on how this book is mainly for a couple who are in love and are looking to reach new heights in their pleasure, specifically geared towards men making women feel great. In Cattrall's words: \\"No one wants to admit that millions of women have unsatisfactory sex lives and that most men do not know what to do about it.\\"Satisfaction takes it a step at a time, chapter by chapter. With chapter headings like \\"The Clitoris,\\" \\"Circles,\\" \\"Figure Eights,\\" \\"Up-Down Flicks,\\" \\"Lips and Teeth,\\" \\"Fingers,\\" as well as a detailed index, the man has no excuse for losing his way in this book which is not even 150 pages long, and is filled with pictures on almost every page. Divided into two major sections: oral sex and sexual positions, the book seeks to enlighten and teach a man how to make a woman reach orgasm in many different ways. Now, the man doesn't have to perform every single act from every single chapter in the book in one \\"session,\\" nor does he have to \\"take one page out of the book\\" for a single session. The point is to experiment, once the basics are known, and eventually come up with your own style. Each of the chapters in the book have only pleasure in mind, and whenever there is any possible pain involved there is a warning, plus with detailed sketches and drawings, mistakes are not likely to be made.Kim Cattrall and Mark Levinson wrote Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm with the aim of binging couples closer together and improving their sexual relationships. This isn't a Men's Health publication with the \\"100 Ways to Satisfy Your Woman\\" piece, but a book that can only help a loving couple. So don't feel embarrassed, because ultimate you both want to have as much fun and get as much pleasure out sex as possible. The key term here is \\"mutual pleasure.\\" So one of you guys buy the book and don't feel ashamed in using it as a reference tool during sex. Remember, it is all a learning process, and we have our whole lives to perfect it. This book is simply offering us a very detailed foundation that will give us a head start on every guy who doesn't have this book and doesn't know how to pleasure the woman he loves.Originally published on September 30th, 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter ([...])."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This book has clear, specific, respectful drawings.

Cattrall's an actress, though, and has a different life story altogether - which should not be news to anyone who loved Marcus Welby, MD, for example - and struggled with the fact that actor Robert Young was not, in fact, a doctor.In this book Cattrall and her new husband, handsome jazz musician Mark Levinson, have collaborated to present their inarguable philosophy of communication, honesty, and love, plus their assortment of fail-safe techniques for attaining what is ardently desired but (according to Cattrall) can be elusive for heterosexual couples: female orgasm. Cattrall begins with the truth of her past: twenty years of sexual unhappiness, remedied only recently by her new husband, Levinson. Readerly expectations are set at \\"high.\\"It's all-around good advice: communication, enthusiasm, honesty, and a work ethic are recommended. Oral sex is mapped and described. Diversity is honored, but anatomy trumps, and is carefully explained.There are beautiful, strong drawings - albeit with instructive and probably sensible red arrows, lines, and various markers - showing precisely what needs to be where in order to succeed at the provocation of the female orgasm. But it is more craft than art that is illustrated and promoted. It's a \\"how-to,\\" a series of road maps. Often there is more to getting there than asking for (and following) directions - but the Levinsons do not address that issueThis is earnest stuff, it means well - but aside from the lovely drawings, and the thrill of hearing from Kim Cattrall, it's not all that different from other, similar books on the shelf."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"I love the honest and open approach of this book. As a woman, I can whole-heartedly agree that nearly all of these ideas would send me on an orgasmic explosion if handled with love and care. If there is any guy out there who wants to know how to make a woman [orgasm], this book is for you.One area that was left out of the book but is almost just as important is the romantic (not sexual) foreplay that gets us in the mood.

This book is a tasteful and educational book about how women can achieve orgasms with their lovers... but above all it emphasizes the importance of both partners having the desire and know-how to please each other. And desire does not always equal know-how! I can't say enough about the value of this book. Buy it and read it. Or buy it for your man and ask that he read it.

The information the book attempts to convey (techniques) is filtered through the authors' stereotypical approach to sex, is jumbled and unclear, and everything they encourage couples to try is written with a sales-copy edge, which only results in giving the reader potentially harmful suggestions about male and female sexuality. It's also quite clear that the authors have no training, education, or background to write a book on sex.Like most mass-market sex guides, the techniques and information are grouped in instant-gratification vignette descriptions, making the reasoning behind the techniques unclear and also giving the reader a clear message that each suggestion is a \\"magic button\\" to orgasm. The authors are unclear about specific parts of the anatomy they refer to, and leave out essential safety information. In fact, it's what's left out of the book that makes it problematic.This book (and every line of text about sex techniques) is layered in assumptions about men, women, and sex. It assumes that men are the \\"do-ers,\\" that they care most about penetration and being \\"finished,\\" and that men will always have a reliable sex drive. What it assumes about sex is most egregious: that there is a \\"magic button\\" for orgasm in women, that women want to come \\"until they can't take it any more,\\" that all women like the types of stimulation in this book, that intercourse is the goal in sex, and much more. These dated notions about sex are in direct contradiction to most other modern sex guides' anti-stereotype, non-judgmental, \\"some, many, and most,\\" and self-determined, self-defined ethics about male and female sexuality. The instant-make-her-come stance the book takes, as we know, implies that a lack of success with the technique lies not in the technique, but in the woman it's supposed to \\"work\\" on. In another instance, the authors state that because men think linearly they prefer in-and-out stimulation, and because women think circularly, they like circular stimulation. How ridiculous.This book begs the question: What are its assumptions, and are they correct? By means of what the authors are saying about sexuality as they describe sex techniques, they are suggesting that smaller truths are larger truths. Making this book worse than inaccurate; it's biased.Lastly, the techniques, suggestions, and positions can be found in any sex guide, and it seriously lacks anything that makes it stand out from the pack -- other than the celebrity hook, of course. Use common sense when you buy a sex guide: look for something inclusive, informative, and not chock full of insult and assumptions like this book. The notions and techniques in \\"Satisfaction\\" are dated. Buy something else."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Thank God a couple had the guts to write real instructions on how to bring a woman to orgasm with a partner. The illustrations are concise. The message is sensitive and specific. Kim and Mark tell us in a sweet, simple and straight forward way exactly what to do. Here it is, all anyone need know. The best book on sex to be published since the 60's. Bravo to everyone involved. A real stunner. Great sex is like great cuisine. It takes technique and practice to pull it off."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"I heard about this book on The View. Listening to the things they said about it and the confessions from Kim intrigued me.There are many illistrations in this book that arrouse your curiosity and other things.... they also drive you to read what they have to say. They are pretty straight forward, something a lot of books aren't. And they are also relevant to this day and age.Though they did add a little more about oral stimulation than other things I still would recommend this as a must try. Even if you are even a little curious.You'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Women have been studying MALE orgasm for centuries. This book is terrific for women who have difficulty 'telling' their man what they want. It's tastefully (no pun intended) done and is very comprehensive. (very explicite as well .... no guessing) A must have for men who don't have a clue on how to be the best lover possible for his woman. She must be honest, and he must be willing. KEEP IN MIND that this book is NOT a femininist book. It is the instruction manual for the WOMAN's orgasm. What a wonderful concept!"},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This is a great read for couples looking to spice up their sex life. It's straightforward, insightful and a whole lot of fun. Even if you already have a great sex life, this is a fun book to read and share together. Easy to read and the instructions are easy to follow. Many books are like this, but this is the best I've read on this subject matter."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"I love the fact that the book is written by a husband and wife - together - that fact alone exemplifies the intimacy and comfort that led to the details of the book. It is a relief to me to know that men can and do get it - that sex is not a purely physcial act, but a loving and spiritual one that creates trust and a bond that last a lifetime. That Mark was willing to share and write a book on it with his wife says a lot about his character and the quality of their relationship.They are both open, frank and shed some light on what men feel when they are trying to please their lover and what women need and want and how they can get it. The pictures are well drawn and tasteful and there is a lot of thought and detail in the book."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"Several reviewers have been, in my opinion, overly critical about this book. In my mind, the reader needs to focus on what it is and what it isn't. Though it does give some instructional detail and techniques, it stresses throughout that the ultimate goal is to provide mutual, intimate enjoyment that enhances a couple's committed relationship and fosters that result. Some have said this book is all about satisfying the woman at the exclusion of the man - the title is pretty clear where the focus is. Much more is involved in satisfying a woman (and so many men are unaware of it) so the focus, in that regard, is probably correct. However, men are, in most cases, easier to satisfy, due to their psychological as well as physical makeup, and will ultimately, though implicitly, reap as much benefit from this as their partner.In addition, I found the personal insight provided via the text entries from both Kim and Mark to be thoughtful, revealing, and genuinely valuable.If one wants more explicit illustrations (though the ones in this book are relatively so, yet tastefully done), don't look here; material catering to that interest is readily available elsewhere. If one can't get past Ms. Cattrall's professional life or disassociate it from her personal one, then they will likely not be able to allow themself to enjoy this book for what it is nor learn from it. If a detailed, step-by-step instruction manual (though certainly some information of that type is provided) is what is expected, then it probably isn't for you either. If one can, however, read this book together with their partner and it helps to nurture their intimate relationship (which, I guarantee you, will help it overall), then it is indeed worthwhile. After all, books can only do so much, the rest is up to you..."},{"Title":"Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm","review":"This book was very interesting to read through.

Complete with diagrams; I sometimes finds myself reading impaired so I found the pictures most helpful.Mrs. Levinson says, \\"Most men and women want the same things sexually-intimacy and deeply fulfilling sex with the one they love. But many couples have a difficult time achieving this. How then do we find sexual satisfaction?\\" We read her book and find out.Mr. Levinson says, \\"The real purpose of this book is to help men develop their intuitive abilities and their overall consciousness and awareness of women and themselves. Ultimately, when she is sexually fulfilled, he has one of his greatest rewards.\\" Listen to this, men, this is why you want to read this book too.The book was well written and well researched. I would have liked to write this book. Can you imagine the research those two writers would have had to endure? It's tough work; someone had to do it. That's not to say that I've had some success in this area, but this book really opened my eyes.I can see women reading something like this. Men, I think, would have to be led to it. But like Mark Levinson promised, the reward will be great.

At the time of the writing, it is true, Marinaro was unaware of U.S. spring creeks outside of Pennsylvania, this does not diminish its value.He realized that this type of fishing was firmly rooted in the 19th century English chalkstream traditions, and built a solid work upon this foundation.Some of what he says, in reference to flies, is either dated or irrelevant to most anglers, and his neglect of the sunken fly will disappoint a few, but his tactics cannot be faulted. Indeed, strategies touted as the most modern are clearly described, along with their pros and cons, unlike the treatment given them in some current works.A fine piece of literature, as well as one of the most significant angling books of the 2oth century."},{"Title":"A modern dry-fly code","review":"I have been fishing for trout for some 50 years, mostly utilizing spinning equipment, but also fly fishing.

There are several merits about this textbook: simplicity, tons of real-world examples, and plain description. Unfortunately, there are several disadvantages about this book that I can't stand:1. Typos, there are many typos in this 9e. Some of them were even correctly printed on 8e.2. Lack of econ models: I can see how difficult it is to write a realworld-oriented international econ textbook with more intuition and less intimidating math models. But what makes Economics different from other social science is the powerful models that give us insights and perspectives. Sometimes it is easier to understand the complicated international economics with some simple models. I don't think Carbaugh did a good job offering econ models at where we need most, especially in the balance of payment and government policies part. I can accept simple, intuitive explanation, but I cannot accept oversimplification.3. Redundancy:Carbaugh spend major part of the textbook talking about international trade but not enough on international finance. There are several topics in international trade that can be combined and some topics in international finance that can be elaborated more. But I think this is author's choice.In conclusion, I think this is a good book if you want to have a general idea about international economics. But I won't recommend it for using in class simply becuase it raises more questions than it explains."},{"Title":"International economics","review":"First of, I must confess that I am prejudiced about this book, because the author, honorable Dr. Robert Carbaugh, was my economics Professor at the University. But, seriously now, I was not an economics major and I also was not a very good student, meaning I missed far too many classes...But, whenever I sat down to read the book, it was very easy to catch up with the rest of the class. In fact, even if you are not a student at all, but just interested in the basics of international economics, you would still find this book very useful. I took four other economics classes and all of them were boring, mainly because of the teachers' inability to teach well. This book, however, is a reflection of a good-natured, quick witted, and highly intelligent economist, who TEACHES REAL STUFF EVERY DAY to the average university students and manages to keep their attention.

I read it all in one weekend. It is, however, also about the writer's mother of whom he has surprisingly intimate knowledge, given that the book is one long complaint about how she had never been there for him. She had become a disciple of Osho, in those days known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. This intimacy, in fact, is possible because Tim Guest has forgiven his mother, and now the two enjoy a relationship which would be the envy of many sons, or daughters, who grew up in much less \\"deprived\\" situations.The reason I rate this book so low is that the author, having failed to forgive Osho, makes a very lousy job of the biographical bits about the master (he insists on using the word guru)There are those who would feel compassion for the growing boy because he missed his mother so. I think that, being an only child, and his nature, he would have missed her anyway. If not Osho (Bhagwan), she would have been claimed by capitalism, consumerism, politics and so-called social life. I feel compassion for TimGuest because he misses Osho so completely, in continuing to harbour bitterness, resentment, in trying to make Him out to be a charlatan. No matter though. He's still young. As time goes on he will get to see more, understand better, and make his peace with Osho also.One thing the book proves beyond doubt. Bhagwan is far from dead, not in Tim's heart, nor in his mind.It is also certain that Tim's one book, on which he sweated and shed so many tears, will soon be forgotten; while Osho's 600 or more books, effortlessly produced, will live on.......... the 93 Rolls Royces will continue to go up in value..... and His communes around the world, having learned what was to learn from the lesson of Rajneeshpurum, will continue to thrive, prosper, grow, multiply.............. What Tim Guest, his mother, and many others have not caught on to, is that for Osho, the commune in Oregon, the cars etc were just devices. Devices to help his disciples, and the world, to grow up."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"This book is a big whine about the author having a poor mother and absent father.

Rarely does a published work resonate so loudly with me. Excellent. I am buying copies for all of my friends during the holidays."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"Without reservation, I recommend MY LIFE IN ORANGE. You are in for a bumpy ride, however, on which your assumptions & judgments really need to be checked at the gate.This is about British disaffected Baby Boomers who first got into grassroots politics until they heard the siren song of the Raggle Taggle Gypsy, the psychic Pied Piper known as Bhagwan Rajneesh.MY LIFE IN ORANGE is all about a child's eye view of living in a collection of communes on three continents made up of people from disparate walks of life whose eyes are set on their quest for enlightenment, rather than on the prize of parenthood.I was an ex-Brit Baby Boomer who took a similar hike albeit through different terrain & my path once crossed with the Orange Cloud, as well as other guru groups. Perhaps my coming up as a \\"stranger\\" in a post-War society that set too much store in their ethnic purity, in an education system that thought their religion was the only one &, finally, behind 3 older brothers, all inoculated me against any male guru adoration. I, too, went in search of commune life, although my taste was more of the SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS kind, which doesn't exist off the silver screen, more's the pity.The telling of MY LIFE IN ORANGE is a profound immersion into Tim Guest's memories of idyllic communes before being dragged off by the adults in his life to treacherous territories where children are treated, at best, like a herd of goats. There are some hindsight insights blended into this feast of memories & stories about a time when a child's life was indeed free. However, as Tim so ably describes, the lines between freedom & abandonment, instincts & politics, ecstasy & emptiness, affection & antipathy are very thin.MY LIFE IN ORANGE will make you think about becoming a parent, an adult, a leader & a follower. It also has something to say about how a child looks at its parents' lives.PS: to all the defensive ones, there's little in Tim's telling that can be construed as anti-Bhagwan. It's in the mind of the reader, if they're so inclined, especially those who've not even read the book. Duh!"},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"It was interesting to read a child's inside view of life in a Rajneesh commune ~ several, actually.

He was able to see a lot of healing in the broken relationship he had with his mom. Other reviewers can't seem to understand why he doesn't extend the same level of forgiveness to the system that raised him. It is because he did not like having to sleep in a dormitory with all the other kids every night. The children were separated from their mothers because familial proximity was considered possessive. He did not like the fact that it was against the rules to have a single toy or book as his very own. He did not like the lack of supervision that characterized his environment because it felt like no one really cared for him one way or the other. He did not like being pressured into embracing spiritual beliefs that he was not comfortable with as he got older. I think that most readers who are not connected with this organization and its leaders would find his objective evaluation of these practices and his lack of an embittered spirit admirable."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but in the end was left feeling it was the work of a five star whinger.

It was interesting but it left me wanting to know more."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"The author, Tim Guest, opens his heart in this book about his childhood in the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh cult and how destructive it was to his family. \\"My mother and her friends wanted to surrender us, their children, to the love and support of the commune, in order to save us from the traumatic confines of nuclear family life.\\"--pages 92 & 93. This is not a dry tome on the nature of cults. Some reviewers have judged the author, but this novel is not a whitewash, but an honest confession of his faults and his desire for a close relationship with his parents. It was heartbreaking how the cult children had to learn to rely upon each other for comfort and intimacy that was denied them with their parents. As a woman, I grieved over his deep longing for a meaningful relationship with his mother and his desire not to always have to share her with others.This novel also shows how an articulate intelligent woman, his mother, becomes slowly enmeshed in the Rajneesh cult and how the countercultural attitudes toward family (\\"the nuclear family itself was at fault: an unwitting agent of capitalist consumerism...\\" pg. 19 and \\"Marriage was part of the bigger swindle; a partriarchal conspiracy to subjugate women...\\" pg. 20) caused her to justify unkind behavior. It's almost a warning of how intellectualism can sometimes cause us to behave inhumanely. (I'm reminded of how college students were able to justify barbaric behavior during the Cultural Revolution in China.)Tim Guest has an amazing memory. Details, such as desiring slippery wooden floors to slide across while wearing socks, helped me to identify with Tim who had common childhood experiences even within the confines of cult life. This is not a lurid expose but an insightful look into how cults operate to focus power in the hands of a few individuals at the expense of their members. I couldn't help thinking, while reading the book, about the parallels of the cult to the intelligensia of our current culture that is promoting the Socialistic mindset and denying the importance of the individual (ie. to end competition, the striving for excellence, the rewarding of mediocrity, the tearing down of high standards, and so forth).I recommend this book for a serious study of cult life. If you're looking for entertainment, this will probably not interest you. It's a quiet, but well-written, book."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"My wife encouraged me to read this book because of the great reviews. All I can say is that this is a complete snooze.

It just wasn't that interesting. It read more like a history of the Bhagwan Rajneesh, and less a story about Guest's childhood experiences. If you want to read about horrifying childhoods or kids in cults, try \\"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress\\" by Susan Jane Gilman or \\"Running with Scissors\\" by Augusten Burroughs. Either one is a more entertaining and less laborious to read."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"Tim Guest is a young British man who was thrust at an early age, by his mother's spiritual search, into the commune life of the controversial Indian guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. In this fascinating and moving biography of his early life as a member of that cult, we witness a boy who nurtures a broken heart through his mother's neglect and self-absorption in her search for enlightenment. We see parallels within the life of Tim's mother and the arc of the cult itself, moving from an off-kilter yet earnest spiritual seeking to a finale best characterized as a sad and empty waste of time. Any intense movement that comes to an end will always have its casualties, and we often think only of the adults who have been directly involved in a cult or movement as such \\"victims\\", but this book poignantly highlights how the children who are given no choice in the matter can be more messed up by the experience and also in later life.Tim writes with a contained emotion about his lonely and strange upbringing, shunted back and forth between confused and misguided parents, particularly his mother, who may have meant well but served to give him absolutely no grounding, real love, or sense of self. Aside from occasional visits with his father, much of the time described in the book concerns Tim's pre-teen years, after his parent's separation, spent with the mother who becomes quite an important figure in the European growth of the Rajneeshi movement. She is no mere rank and file follower, but a key figure in the British leadership, and has some direct encounters with the Bhagwan himself. Eventually, the movement unravels under the weight of leadership scandals, tax, immigration, legal and other myriad problems.Tim gives a very well researched and appropriate level of insight into the movement, as if seeing it again through the eyes of the adolescent he was. We read only obtuse accounts of the rumoured sexual scandals, rape and violence for which the cult was known, since Tim, as the last paragraph of the book tellingly alludes to, was luckily spared some of the darker activities that were going on around him. Needless to say, however, he still has his scars to deal with, most centrally his parents' lack of real involvement in his life. Through it all, he appears to have emerged as a deep and thoughtful person, and this memoir is a top-notch and moving read."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"What happens when a child is swept up in his mother's quest to become a follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, an Indian guru? How does a child have a normal childhood when it is spent traveling from England to Germany and other locales, all because of a parent's search for truth and enlightenment?If Guest's memoir is any indication, the children of such parents may well be left feeling dazed, confused and neglected. In Guest's case, his mother spent much of her time involved in such activities as ecstatic dancing, group sex and bizarre rituals, some involving violence and even abuse. She wore bright clothing in the colors of the sunset.In all fairness, his mother was not aware of the darkness at the heart of the Rajneesh movement and when charges of embezzlement and even a possible plan to commit murder came to light, she had a change of heart and began to examine all her earlier assumptions. In her own way, she was nearly as naive, trusting and innocent as a child...although I can't help feeling she should have known better and been there for her son as a parent first, with her spiritual adventures coming second.I was happy to read that she did eventually make peace with her son and come to realize the harm she'd done to him, however inadvertently."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"When I think about children growing up in communes, victims of cults, I think about the abuses you always hear happen in these situations. I imagined when I picked up this book that it would be a horrifying tale of sexual and physical abuse of a small child. I braced myself. Instead, I found that the child narrator, Tim, wasn't sexually or physically abused. In fact, he seemed to have many fond memories related to the commune and his life there. It was only when considered from an adult's point of view that the shocking amount of neglect comes into focus. The children in the commune did suffer in this very specific way. The damage was not as graphic and sensationalized as many people expect from a story about growing up in a cult, but it was horrifying nonetheless. Tim Guest did a fantastic job balancing this story to show why people might have been sucked into this commune in the first place, and then why they would decide to leave."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"This book gives a startling, funny, sometimes unbelievable account of a child's life growing up in existentialist communes all over the world. From six years old, Tim Guest travels the world, dragged helplessly by his mother, in search of enlightenment--all through the teachings of Bahgwan, an uconventional guru. As the reader, you can experience the contradiction of the notion of a carefree childhood and living a life where attachment to family and friends was viewed as a path to certain destruction. What's more, you can read it through the eyes of child. It is a compelling story, without judgement or prejudice. It is the most eloquent and poignant book I have read TO DATE. The ultimate book for my fellow yogis out there. Read it, then pass it on!"},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"This book is the true story of a young boy whose mother joins one of Bhagwam's communes in the early 1980s. Bhagwam's theory of reaching a higher spiritual plane heavily incorporates the idea of detachment- if you are detached from the things of this world, you will find your place. Unfortunately for Tim and the other children in the commune, they are forced to be part of their parents' new world while at the same time being kept at arms length from the love and attachment they want and need. Tim Guest tells of the years he spent in the communes, the people he knew there, and the effect the very unique lifestyle choice of his mother affected his life.Quote: \`Our parents were saving the world, but saving the world took time. While they danced, rolled their heads, swayed their arms, flailed their malas, beat cushions, broke down their social conditioning, and set themselves free, we filled our lives as best we could with the things we found around us.\\"I liked this book most of the time . . . it was one of those things that I couldn't read straight through (although in all fairness I have a really really short bookreading attention span and usually have several different things at once I go back and forth between) but at the same time I could never abandon it because I was really invested in Tim's story and finding out what ultimately happened to him, Bhagwam, and the commune. The story takes place in India, Britain, Germany, and the United States, and it was interesting to see the setting change. The story was certainly and unique and fascinating glimpse into commune life, from the perspective of someone who has not chosen it but instead has it thrust upon them."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"I just finished this book and I felt it was money well spent. I was a member of a different cult myself but felt such an affinity with the story Mr. Guest was telling. I can't say I \\"enjoyed\\" the book, even though Mr. Guest used a lot of humor it was hard not to shudder at the horrific childhood he endured. I would like to see more books like this one by children raised in these groups. Though I don't really feel even adults make an informed choice when they join a cult a child has no choice at all. His story was compelling."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"What is it like growing up in a commune especially one modeled on the teachings of Indian guru Bhagwan Rajneesh? It was one big trip as attested by Tim Guest in his remarkable memoir about living under the teachings of Rajneesh. Tim's experiences shows us what happens to children who raised in a cultic environment. While the children's parents are seeking enlightment, the children roam free but on a deeper level are wanting more from their parents who seem oblivious to their emotional needs.My Life in Orange takes us on a roller coaster of travel and spiritual enlightenment. Meet Tim's parents who are disillusioned with their lives and surrender their lives to the guru. Thus begins Tim's life as a globe trotter as he travels with his mother to India, Germany, the United States and Britain as she carries out the dictates of the cult. He shows us the child's perspective of what is going on in the day to day life of the community.What you see varies from community to community but Tim is able to give us a glimpse of the political intrigues, depression, manipulation, exploitation and power struggles that take place with the adults. You see just how well the guru had his followers under control.Tim's story will make you laugh, cry and at times wonder what in the world was wrong with his parents. In their attempts to escape their own disillusionment was it right to drag their infant son on their self centered trip? Tim's life tells us more about the selfishness of young adults who have no grounding in life and will subject themselves to anyone who promises them bliss.This is a great book in understanding the process of child rearing in a cultic environment and its final product as the organization falls apart. In order to understand his life after the fall of Rajneesh, Tim had to reclaim his past. My Life in Orange is the culmination of his reflection and understanding of what made him into the man that he is today."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"A couple of other reviewers have complained this wasn't \\"readable.\\" I didn't have that problem at all.Rather, my chief problem was that the narrator was frequently \\"out of the loop\\" on the real action, and is only now reconstructing it in his adulthood. Thus you're frequently going to be disappointed. Passages like the following are typical:\\"It was Easter, so while our mothers at silently in rows and stared at the wall, we hunted chocolate eggs in the garden. Then we discovered a hayloft with a gap just the right size to jump out of . None of the other kids wanted to make the leap, but after jumping through the Kalptaru meditation hall trapdoor I knew about falls like these.\\" (p. 63)I remember when the Bhagwan's followers founded a controversial, free-wheeling ashram in Oregon. I was just a teenager at the time. We had been told on the news that the followers believed in \\"free love,\\" so as horny teenagers we certainly had fantasies of such a place.But I was hoping for a book that would talk about what life was like in that cult, not just the free love, but also the disillusionment, the drugs, etc. Instead Guest was very young (6 years old) when taken to live in that commune, and I felt his childhood impressions, while somewhat interesting, will fall short of the mark if you are looking for a tell-all book that reveals the straight dope on what went on in Osho's communes. Guest learns about many of the outrageous episodes indirectly, so aside from the fact that he actually was dressed in orange, he comes across as having no more insight about things than you or I would.I will say in the book's favor, though, that the second half is much better than the first. The second half is less about his personal childhood than the dissolution of the movement, which makes for interesting reading. The parts where he describes the aftereffects of the cult of his family's life . . . well, I found those parts touching and instructive.Here's two other books on the same subject:\\"Breaking the Spell: My Life as a Rajneeshee, and the Long Journey Back to Freedom,\\" by Jane Stork. From Australia; available only as an import in the U.S.\\"Bhagwan: The God That Failed,\\" by Hugh Milne. Apparently the best-known book on the subject before Guest's came out: has a lot more of the sex and scandal, from what I understand."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"I think that Tim Guest's work My Life in Orange: Growing Up With the Guru is an excellent look into the way the life of a cult through the eyes of a child. This book was of great interest to me as I live in Oregon, which was home to the Rajneeshpuram commune and where much of the controversy took place. I liked the way that Guest tells his own personal story while at the same time narrates what was going on with the rest of the cult, making it both a personal and chronological account of the cult. Guest has an excellent writing style. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in alternative religious groups."},{"Title":"My Life in Orange","review":"Tim Guest not only seems to have turned out remarkably well-adjusted and healthy for living through an often horrific, certainly neglected childhood, but he is also a sensible and crafty memorist as well. For all the damaging therapy encounter groups and hoards of sannyasins (those who walk the spiritual path) that Guest lived with and observed daily, his recollections and reporting are meticulous. If you want to get an innocent insider's view of what happened behind the tangerine clouds of India, London, Germany, Oregon, than this book is a must. I finished it a less than a week. For all the maternal neglect that Guest endured, he writes of his mother with great compassion and of himself with impressive self-awareness."},{"Title":"World Cup Chess: The Grandmasters Grand Prix","review":"The Grand Prix was a series of grandmaster tournaments that ran from 1988 to 1989 organized by Lubomir Kavalek for Garry Kasparov's newly formed GMA (Grandmasters Association). The tournaments took place all over the world. This book contains a detailed account of each tournament along with all 1,600 games played on the grand prix. 22 of the games are well annotated. This book should please those interested in instruction or recent chess history."},{"Title":"The Shenandoah Valley in 1864 (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"The destruction of the Shenandoah was among the most tragic events of the war. It was rich in beef and grain, and from its exit at Harper's Ferry a Confederate force could attempt to capture Washington from the rear. This happened time and again. When Grant began his great drive on Richmond to end the war in 1864, he needed to assure that a rebel force did not slip around him through the valley to again threaten Washington. Sheridan was ultimately assigned the task of assuring an army could find no sustenance there. \\"If a crow tried to fly across the valley it would starve to death, \\" he boasted to Grant.This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work. Here is the DSI edition:&lt;...>The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such.

There is engaging dialogue and entertaining characters with detailed cultural information.The setting is India where a man Sripathi, 50ish, shares a big house with his bitter, aging mother; his unmarried sister Putti, an unemployed son Arun, his wife Nirmala, and a newcomer to the home, a 7 year-old granddaughter whose parents were killed.As the reader, we experience the conditions, we feel for the people and have hope for their future. Characters are very well-described and consistent to their history.The author has a gifted way of weaving the present with past histories. The reader learns plenty about Sripathi's past and his own parents lives. Chapters are easily identifiable to their content. The interesting story, real characters, are conflict and tension while the plot flows evenly.There are plenty of bitter events in this family's lives. When his daughter Maya failed to complete an arranged marriage in India, Sripathi was shamed, further in debt, and disowned her. However, wife Nirmala was the communicative strength.We never get to know Maya, but through flashbacks we learn a little. And now, she and her husband were killed in Vancouver and the Indian family gains a granddaughter who is internally traumatized and doesn't speak.This story will keep you interested throughout!.....Rizzo."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This book is a great story for anyone who wants to curl up on a cold day.

The author weaves a wonderful and interesting tale."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time. The characters were compelling and authentic. While the setting was India, the range of human emotions portrayed was truly universal. The reader becomes absorbed in the family members and their interactions, with enough of a plot to make the pages turn. I saw so many familiar people in the characters, and I live in New Jersey, not India. The author is a true storyteller."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"The characters are well done, the plot is engaging, the evocation of India excellent. BUT I can only give this book 4 stars because it badly needed an editor. As a reader who refuses to skip a word, in this book, I was sorely tempted. Almost every page could have benefited by being cut, a little and sometimes a lot. Nonetheless, we have real talent here and this is not a book to be missed... maybe skimmed in places. Look forward to her next one. Bound to be Great as this is almost so."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"delightful and fascinating story. Ms. Badami (like many of her countrymen and women) have that ability to present a wonderful and engrossing story of a family dealing with the vagaries of maintaining dignity and a semblance of pride in the highly corrupt culture and society that is Modern India. Well paced and reminds me of many of Rohinton Mistry's books."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"*** Spoilers to follow ***The back cover of the book describes how the granddaughter brought 'unexpected hope' to a depressed household. But honestly, she doesn't. At least Mrs. Badami doesn't tell us how. She eloquently tells a story that doesn't really seem to go anywhere.Sripathi is the main character and key to the entire book. Sripathi's change of feelings seem to be triggered by his fever and while I fully understand how serious illness can change a person, I didn't like how the change wasn't complete. For example, he didn't really learn his lesson with Maya, which is demonstrated by how he allows his mother to treat Putti concerning Putti's engagement. He does, however, begin to appreciate Arun better, and that's good to see. He shows that he's going to raise litle Nandu differently from Maya, even though she seems to be the spitting image of her mother (in temperament, at least.)My favorite character has to be Nirmala. Although it takes her 3/4 of the book to do it, she finally becomes a person in her own right. When she accepts Gopaul's mother's proposal of a match between Gopaul and Putti without consulting anyone, the reader wants to applaud.All in all, a readable book, but I was slightly disappointed in the ending. It seemed happy, but for very little reason. I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"The Hero's Walk is one of those rare novels that just sweep you up until you relunctantly turn the last page.

Badami summons up India with amazing powers of description, and the characters are all drawn with a very fine brush.

This is about an Indian family, but in a larger sense, it is about all families and the transforming power of forgiveness."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"Off all the many novels I have read about modern India this is the most disappointing. Paragraph after paragraph of numbing detail about daily routines, petty arguments and family disapproval wear away at the otherwise sensitive depictions of the familial roles and expectations that this family burdens under. The characters somehow never really emerge as real people, although the multi-generational theme is tied neatly together. This book was slightly reminiscent of the book Palace Walk set in old Cairo, but which was vastly superior in cultural depictions and well-drawn characters you could either care about or despise. The characters in this novel seemed two-dimensional and passive."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"I just finished one of the most amazing books I'veread this year. The Hero's Walk is undoubtedly one ofthe finest books ever written in English by an Indian.What makes this book so different and refreshing apartfrom the plot is the treatment of the books and itscharacters. The plot revolves around Sripathi Rao - asimple man with simple needs in the town of Totapuramnestled in the South of India - and in the Big Housewe meet his wife Nirmala - the ever docile Indian Wife- his horrendous mother Ammaya who in most respectscan be labelled a witch - his unmarried sister Putti -who longs for the boy next door, and his son Arun - arebellion in the true sense of the word.Amidst all this lies the past - of his daughter Mayagetting married to a foreigner and residing inVancouver - who has never seen her family for sevenyears now.

Others have reviewed the emotional/psychological aspects of the book, so I will address her depiction of India. I lived in southern India from 1996 to 1997 and Anita Badami's description of the area and the people of India were absolutely on the money. It was a sympathetic, if unforgiving, depiction of her homeland. When the monsoons hit, the streets do run with sewage. The electricity does go off many times throughout the day. The heat is brutal before the monsoons hit. There are scalper's selling tickets to the movies! And Deepavali is a festival of light and fireworks that I remember fondly, coming in the cool wet season of the year. I would read a passage and close my eyes and instantly be transported back to my room in Bangalore with the rumbling of the coming monsoon storm; the smell of dinner being prepared by Radha, our cook, who kept pictures and statues of gods and goddesses from every conceivable religion in the pantry next to our kitchen (&quot;It is best, madam, to honor all the gods. You never know.&quot;); and the funny cry of those strange little squirrels with the two stripes down their backs. This book will forever remain on my shelf of favorites, to be read again and again in the future."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"The paralyzing heat at 5:00 a.m. on a July morning in Toturpuram, on the southeast coast of India, is depicted in intense, sensual imagery from the opening of the novel and becomes a metaphor for the lives of the Rao family. Three generations living together in a large and decaying house which they cannot afford to maintain, the Raos constantly carp at each other and seethe with long-standing resentments, the emotional temperature rising in concert with the heat, which &quot;[hangs] over the town in long, wet sheets.&quot;Author Badami carefully selects her details to reveal both the realities of her characters' lives and the emotional climate they inhabit. The grande dame and grandmother of the family, Ammayya, is a slightly senile, mean-spirited, and caste-conscious woman, who controls her son Sripathi, her daughter Putti, and her long suffering daughter-in-law Nirmala. With unusual and homely similes and metaphors, Badami establishes the tone. Nirmala is &quot;like a bar of Lifebuoy soap, functional but devoid of all imagination.&quot; Nirmala and Sripathi are &quot;like a pair of bullock yoked together, endlessly turning the water wheel round and round, eyes bent to the earth.&quot; The cloudy sky is &quot;curdled milk.&quot;Romance is the heart of the action. The problems in the marriage of Ammayya and her husband, and of Sripathi and Nirmala are described in detail. By contrast, Sripathi's daughter Maya has happily married an American and lives in the U.S, but she has been banished from Sripathi's life for defying his wishes. When Maya and her husband Alan are killed in an accident, leaving an 8-year-old daughter the Raos have never met, they bring this silent and traumatized orphan to India and into their uncertain lives.Predictably, the family learns from each other and begins to communicate, but the events which bring about these changes are either telegraphed early in the book (the fate of Putti, Sripathi's sister, for example) or result from external chance and not from their own actions. Additionally, the responses of the child to her strange, new environment do not ring true. Already traumatized and silent, this fragile child faces additional traumas after her arrival in Toturpuram, including some very dramatic ones at the end of the book, yet she seems to suffer no ill effects. Badami tells us the book is about &quot;the chanciness of existence, the beauty and the hope and the loss that always accompanies life,&quot; themes she has abundantly illustrated, but the warm and fuzzy ending owes more to chance than what we or the characters would expect.

The characters are wonderfully drawn, the story simple yet compelling. We are given an intimate look into the daily lives of each member of the family. Each character a marvelous study unto themselves. We feel the family's pain and small joys, as they try as best they can to exist in a society that seems to be falling apart around them. Unlike another reviewer who grew tired of the 'excessive' references to sights, sounds and smells, I was fascinated by these descriptions, even when reading about the family waking up to find their home flooded by raw sewage!

I would highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"As a native of South Asia, the things referenced in the book rang true with me...the characters' voices, their actions, their reactions...it was all so familiar.

I'd be curious to know if the author actually knows people like the ones she has written about. At any rate, she's written a book that deserves praise and plenty of attention."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This is one of a handful of books that have taken up permanent residence in my mental library. The characters are vividly drawn and the plot is masterfully driven. From time to time, a passage from the book will revisit me. Once again I am reminded that human drama crosses all cultural lines.A beautiful story filled with humor, tragedy and compassion."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This was such a wonderful book to read. It's the type of book, that attracts your attention in the first page and you just can't put it down till the end. I am giving this wonderful book to my mother-in-law to read. I know she'll love it."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"I absolutely adore this book! Anita Rau Badami has managed to beautifully incorporate the mind-set of both middle-aged, traditional Indian parents, with that of a child being brought up by mixed parents, in Canada.The characters come to life and their emotions pull the reader into the pages and the plot.It is beautifully written, and the story itself is very realistic. The characters are each victims in their own ways and Badami has been able to portray them, not as characters in a story, but as people living in our world, surviving the laughter and tears of everyday life.Read this book, it might really help to change your life...or simply to make you think."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This is a beautifully written book, especially with its slow lead into characterization. The characters have depth and presence and the reader can feel and connect with them all.This novel is about an Indian man who is estranged from his daughter because she forsook an arranged marriage in India to marry a Canadian. She has tried to reconcile with her father who has coldly, with prideful distance, refused any connection with her. She and her husband die suddenly in an automobile accident and their traumatized daughter is left to be raised by her Indian grandparents.How Sripathi works through his grief, confronting the pain of his choices which can never be undone, marks the essence of this book. The family comes alive on the pages, all in subtle and unambiguous character development.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"A Hero's walk is both a vivid, ala non-fiction portrayal of life in India and a richly-told fictional story of an extended family.The story is set in a big, old house in southern India, complete with the heat, dust, street vendors, smells, sounds, neighbors, routine daily occurances, and a little squalor, all authentically rendered by an observant, native writer.The family centers around the mis-understood, under-the-gun husband and his family's issues, his long-suffering, non-entity wife, her chronically unhappy (read whining, but vicious) aging Mother, their neer-do-well, lazy son, their long-missed successful daughter who has abandoned the family and India for the good life in Canada, her invisible husband, and their much-loved grandaughter.Without giving anything away, the story leads to trauma for the grandaughter told very feelingly from her point of view. A very good novel."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This book is a light read. I would probably have not read it if it were written about an equivalent western family. The insights into Indian family dynamics make the story more interesting from the point of view of a person unfamiliar with the culture. Badami gets us to understand life of a middle class Indian family. The story is colorful and fun. Badami does a nice job of character development. At some point the father ends up going to Vancouver, Canada and bringing back his grandaughter back to India to live with the family. The contrast of life in India versus Vancouver is certainly interesting from the grandaughter's point of view.This is not particularly fine literature, but a worthwhile read if you are interested in Indian culture especially."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"A modern day Brahmin family living on the eastern coast of southern India with all the attendant social ills and personal failings of real people who struggle along in every country to survive political corruption, loss of status, changing times, family death and their own pride.

Sent a copy to my Mom & she stayed up all night reading it.Normally, I'm a Jane-ite and fond of other 19th century English writers as well as a fan of \\"good\\" mysteries (latter being very enjoyable mental gum chewing) but this book - on its lonesome - got me VERY enthused about Indian literature.Extremely well written.

Things come to a head when his daughter and her husband are killed in a car accident in Vancouver and the Canadian born granddaughter he's never met comes to India to live with them.A really intense reading experience about a family in crisis though the ending seemed a little rushed & not really credible."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This is a wonderful book.

I fell in love with this family, and felt the things they felt as I read the book.Bring on the sequel!"},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"I thorougly enjoyed this book! Infact, once I started reading it, I was instantly captured, and could not put it down. The book has 400 pages, and I read it in two days!! I enjoyed Anita Rao Badami's first book, Tamarind Mem.... and was ecstatic to discover The Hero's Walk. Coming of age occurs at any given age, and this book clearly proves it! I can't wait for Anita to publish a third novel. Read it, you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"I just finished reading this book and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed reading.. it's one of those books which you cannot put down. The build up of characters, (particularly Sripathi Rao) is amazing, and so is the story development.. very touching and emotional at times. If there were a moral to the story, it would definitely be: Live In the Moment."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"ever read. The depth of understanding of human emotion and angst was impressive, especially as all the characters had to face their roles from what is expected from them as following old rules of behavior and bending and fitting them into more modern rules. The part where Nirmala finally asks herself why she This is one of the best Indian authored non-fiction books I have never thought to question listening to mother-in-law, husband, without thinking about what SHE wanted is where most of end up finding ourselves at some point in life. The characters were explained and developed that I could recognize them as real people who were finding their way in life as it unfolded to them and still carrying on. I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"I cannot rave about this book enough. I was hooked from page one. The author's use of language was just beautiful, and I loved how the story tied together and had a most satisfying ending.In fact, toward the middle I started getting antsy about how it would end, so I turned to read the last few pages (yeah, I do that). However, the author had apparently anticipated this move, and the answer to the question I had was nowhere to be found in the last few pages. I had to actually finish the book before I found out what happened. Excellent.Other reviewers have given you the plot, so I won't do the same. I just wanted to chime in and say what a wonderful story this was, how utterly fascinating, and gripping from start to finish. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This book is touching, heart-breaking and most of all, realistic. I could not help but thinking how would I feel if, as a little girl, I would have been torn away from my culture and my recently-deceased parents' world to live with relatives in an unknown, mysterious place on the other side of the planet. That is how much impact the book has-- you feel the pain, love and feelings constrained by cultural norms that every character is burdened by. What is wrong and what is right takes many different meanings. The book makes you reconsider values that are culturally accepted but that go against the human spirit. How hearbreaking it must be for a parent to cut all ties with a beloved child because of a marriage against his/her wishes? As a reader, you can't stop thinking about that either."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"Truly enjoyble. First time I ever read a book by Anita R. Badami, but I must say it was a real pleasure. The book is written in a very reader friendly pattern and as the characters are not too many one does not loose the complexities of all that are there. Though it can get a bit sad at times, but Badami helps the reader with the witty humour of her characters. I look forward to reading her other books."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"I LOVED this book. While I know very little about India this book brought the country alive for me. I was struck that this story could take place in any country, not just India. A very enchanting and insightful story of what people/families can do to eachother--both good and bad."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This is one of the most satisfying novels I've read in months. Anita Rau Badami is a first-rate writer and first-rate storyteller. Her novel is richly detailed, funny, and ultimately quite moving. I felt very much like I had been taken inside a culture that is foreign to me and made to feel very much at home. If you love a strong narrative, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This book was full of wonderful imagery, and the themes were well-woven in this simple plot. As a reader, I really developed empathy for Sripathi, and admiration for Nirmala. The characters were life-like and this is what gave the story it's charm because we were able to also get a glimpse into the minds of the characters even for a fleeting moment. This is wonderful reading if you want to have a taste of India."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"While I really enjoyed Badami's first book, The Hero's Walk proved cumbersome and tedious. The plot lacks any creativity. It plods along at a labourious and predictable pace. The reader is \\"told\\" rather than \\"shown\\" everything feeling, thought, emotion. Pales in comparison to Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"Peopled with an insular Indian family, this deceptively simple novel allows the reader to peek behind the scenes of everyday familial interactions. This family has moved through the years almost by rote, honoring the old ways and accepting the mundane pattern of their lives.Meanwhile,across the ocean in America, tragedy strikes and an orphaned child appears on their doorstep. This helpless little granddaughter is the catalyst that finally propells the family into the future. In contrast, the great-grandmother tenaciously clings to the past, ever more self-absorbed as her worst traits define her final years.In order to survive, family members redefine their roles, charged with a renewed sense of interest. To nurture the child, they must open themselves to the future, and become more tolerant of eachother in the process. Ms. Badami writes with a straightforward charm, unpeeling the intricacies of her characters layer by layer."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This book is heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, a page-turner filled with pathos. I loved it madly."},{"Title":"Cinq-Mars: Or, A conspiracy under Louis XIII","review":"This book was chose by a member of my Women's book group. I had a really hard time reading this book for about the first 1/2. Don't know why, I guess, the author's writing style was different from what I usually read, but I stuck with the book, and when I had finished I could admit that I had actually enjoyed it. Lots of family drama going on. Many characters with different names that made it, to me, hard to keep up with them. But I was very happy that I stuck with it and finished the book. I got attached to the characters and was definitely glad I read this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of family stories."},{"Title":"The Heir of Starvelings","review":"This book is very sensitive and sad--- a jewel. It stays with you long after you finish it."},{"Title":"Real World Enterprise Reports Using VB6 and VB .NET","review":"Most of the technical books on the market are organized to address a specific technical issue.This book allows you to search based on business requirements. This is a very unique approachand helpful for developers. Additionally, there are many effective working examples.It also discusses different reporting tools such as VS-View, Crystal Reports, Active Reports, and OLAP.I would strongly recommend this to any company which uses more than one reporting package.It is a valuable reference tool.

Chock full of examples and side bars, beginning to advanced users will find something worthwhile in its pages. Coverage of popular reporting tools such as Crystal Reports and Active Reports prove informative, but more informative, interesting and cost effective yet was the discussion on using the ubiquitous Microsoft Office as a reporting tool from VB6 and VB.NET. I found the authors' advice on creating general purpose criteria screens for reporting, invaluable in several of my consulting projects. If you want to weigh your reporting options, become a better report smith, build a reusable reporting library and impress your clients, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Real World Enterprise Reports Using VB6 and VB .NET","review":"A clear concise guide to the ever changing landscape of reporting tools and their myriad uses.

His coverage of different 3rd-party solutions such as Crystal Reports and ActiveReports is one of the highlights of the text. I was unhappy with the focus on tabular reports, with basically no coverage of more graphical presentation options like charts and graphs. These are often more challenging to develop, and expert advice from a source like this would be quite valuable. The book also seemed to have too much of a focus on building specific reports for specific business requirements, and not enough on building more generalized solutions to cover a wider range of reporting problems for end users."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"This book is well-written, which is why I give it 3 stars; but much of it is well-written nonsense, which is why I give it only 3 stars.First, it is mis-titled. It is not about opera so much as about opera singers, in particular female opera singers who allegedly appeal especially to gay men, such as Maria Callas (there is a whole section (pp. 134-53) on \\"the gay cult of Callas\\") - what must my wife think when I play her records?Second, where it leaves off the gays-as-super-aesthetes stuff, and attempts to discuss testable hypotheses, it often gets the facts backwards. For example: \\"Records helped kill opera by limiting the repertoire to a handful of repeated and repeatable chestnuts.\\" (p. 47) The truth is of course the exact opposite. Before records, a handful of operas were performed in a season and every season would include at least a Boh&egrave;me, a Butterfly, and/or a Carmen - one would be lucky to hear a couple of hundred operas in an entire lifetime even if one lived in one of the few world cities with an opera company. Today I can, as I do, live in the desert and choose from thousands of recorded operas whenever I feel like it, an unprecedented cornucopia of operatic riches. Similarly, Koestenbaum states that \\"opera virtually died with Puccini\\" (p. 74). That is true only if you don't count Richard Strauss's Arabella (1933) and Capriccio (1942), Alban Berg's Wozzeck (1925) and Lulu (1937), or all or most of the operas of Hindemith, Weill, Krenek, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Gershwin, Poulenc, Menotti, Barber and Benjamin Britten. Puccini may represent the end, even the Indian summer, of romantic Italian opera, but scarcely of opera."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"There's no denying that Wayne Koestenbaum is a very smart man, but that still doesn't make THE QUEEN'S THROAT very worthwhile. The narratorial persona he adopts (which he's stuck to ever since the book was published ten years ago) is of a slight hysterical, over-the-top aesthete who takes to impossibly grandiose and silly declamations (such as when he pretends to dream he is Thas: &quot;Wayne, Thas must have pearls!&quot;). The book really belongs to that peculiar moment in academia when writers could claim whatever trivial thing they did in daily life was politically important, with regard to identity politics, simply because they claimed it to be &quot;subversive&quot;; if you give even two seconds worth of thought to the strictures and actual repressive measures gay men and women must face on a daily basis all over the world, you'll see how trivial Koestenbaum's claims that his trivialities are politically important really are.There is some fun to be had in the reading of this work, but the narrator's giddy narcissism does get very wearisome after a while. This new edition comes with a new and especially pompous preface from Tony Kushner."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"Koestenbaum has crafted an insightful if sometimes academic work in &quot;The Queen's Throat.&quot; He charts the peculiar affinity between gay men and the opera, a relationship he believes begins with an &quot;outsider&quot; sensibility that the sexuality and the musical genre share, and along with that a love of artifice.So far so good, but the book hits rough going about two thirds of the way through when Koestenbaum enters that stream of thought loosely housed under the heading of &quot;deconstruction.&quot; Central to the decon. canon is the impossiblity of separating art and politics, and opera as well as gayness are for the author &quot;subversive.&quot; I read a lot of gender studies/ feminist thought and even so, I found his line of reasoning rough going. &quot;The Queen's Throat&quot; is worthwhile, but a carefree night at the opera, it ain't."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"Written as a series of numbered soul-scouring diary entries, this weightless volume links metropolitan gay American life in the 1970s and 80s with American grand opera's obsession with class, and as such belongs in the cultural anthropology section of anyone's library. But having expressed the link, it bathes in it and rolls around in it, and expects the reader to sympathize, without substantiation. It is its own indictment."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"This is daring, high-wire exploratory literature of the most beguiling kind. Much more than a reach into the mystery-laden world of one aspect of gay culture, though it is that as well, this is a book about desire, about the fantastical meanings within music, about enslavement and redemption. I read the book in one sitting. It's a devastating piece of prose writing, it gleams and pulls you awake with pins! It is a riveting exposition of the extravagance of sexuality, of sexual desire as metaphor for psychological neglect, an enticing and bewitching brew of fantasy and sorrow. Koestenbaum is in sublime command of his thought, the language is both startling and voluptuous, operatic, really. In Chapter 4, entitled &quot;The Callas Cult&quot;, he begins one paragraph &quot;Worshipping Callas, am I behaving like a vulture?&quot; After thoroughly examining the widespread, unreasoned obsession with Maria Callas, he concludes &quot;But it's impossible to circumscribe love. As a commentator, one can only operate like a skylight at a premiere, advertising a location.&quot; The mastery of prose throughout is never anything short of brilliant, and is often ecstatic, so that the book's 'colors' dip inevitably toward the mystical, the ineffable. I think it is a complete triumph, a masterfully accomplished piece of unforgettable literature. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"As an opera lover I found this to be a delightful book aimed directly at all of us who love opera. Unique in his presentation and passionate in his approach to the subject, Wayne Koestenbaum illuminates the queer and queerer aspects of Opera in a way that is both intriguing and fascinating. Using opera as metaphor for gay life the divas of the past take on a melancholy patina that is affecting in its ability to communicate an earlier age of gay culture. The divide marked by Stonewall and the ravages of AIDS lends the book a haunting aura in spite of the morsels of operatic trivia that otherwise are still scandalously funny. The high point of the book for many will undoubtedly be the obligatory paean to the revolution known as \\"The Callas Cult\\".\\"Luchino Visconti, in a photograph, kisses Callas's cheek, which makeup foundation has made unnaturally pale; Leonard Bernstein exclaims, \\"Callas? She was pure electricity.\\" Visconti and Bernstein loved Callas not because they were gay but because she was a genius;\\" (p 136)There are more details than could have been imagined about opera, from divas to opera queens, including musical trivia galore for those interested in the lives of Callas or Ponselle or Patti. The almost fifty pages devoted to \\"A Pocket Guide to Queer Moments in Opera\\" may be alternatively revealing or nostalgic depending on the readers' personal experiences. The result is a unique combination of reflections on camp, glamour, spectacle, privacy, identity, coming-out and more. For those who want to go beyond the basics of the music and drama of opera, who want to delve into the world of gay culture and the desires built upon the lore of Opera divadom, this is the that book takes them behind the scrim and into 'never land'."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"Exquisitely written, I loved this book, especially the chapter on the unspeakable marriage of words and music. A very personal meditation on an art, the author does the unthinkable, merging reminisces with fragments of sometimes personal history, gently turning a kaleidescope. Each tiny list, observation, is a like a breath, repeated as one might experience in meditation. The form conforms to the content--presenting an intuition rather than a didactic explanation. The author traverses the terrain between reality and dream, the pleasurable ground which is opera. Not really about homosexuality, the author explores the nether world between homosexuality and heterosexuality, revealing a realm where dreams inhabit the same universe as daily banal life. I found it profoundly touching, deeply illuminating, exposing ancient roots. If you know how words once married to music can penetrate the ear and push the body to ecstacy, you know the mystery of which the author speaks--poetry, reminding of intimate experiences past. The author succeeds where so many have failed, resurrecting a mystical experience."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"The Queen's Throat is an insightful and animated blend of knowledge and intuition exploring the connections and overlappings of homosexuality and opera, arriving at a number of intriguing conclusions. The core of opera's queerness is dismantled and reassembled with a reflective and lyrical precision that defies typical essay format and approach. This is a brilliant monologue -- a very entertaining brainstorm which even includes silly graphics. It's smart, funny, personal, and spirited and even of interest for the operatically challenged. In fact, I bet big opera fans would give this a five."},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"The author is sometimes outrageous yet outspoken in some of his assumptions and observations about those who attend and enjoy opera and those singers and other musicians who perform these works. Some may disagree vehemently with some or all of his consclusions, but no one who reads this book will be without an opinion - either agreeing wholeheartedly with the author or having a &quot;hissy fit&quot; over his &quot;over-the-top&quot; arguments and perceptions. It is amusingly illustrated with occasionally very droll captions to go with the archival photos. On the whole, this book is a pleasant diversion for before-bed reading and may keep you from falling asleep with some of the author's &quot;apercus&quot; in mind"},{"Title":"Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire","review":"Me likey the book, me likey Gays in Opera cause no one writes about (see \\"Opera: The Undoing of Women; Catherine Clement) them.And Opera, Callas singing Delibes Laksme is good.

Bill Hersh writes his story on a very personal level; I felt his loss and knew, as an American, it was my loss, too."},{"Title":"Passing the Baton: The Norman \\"Joe\\" Hirsch Story","review":"From one generation to the next -- despite life's trials and sorrows -- the baton of hope is passed. This author does a remarkable job of illustrating that point as he tells the story of one family. But Passing the Baton goes far beyond being simply a memoir.Jerry Rekned, as family friend and witness to their lives, shares the Hirsch family story in first person. The author, through Jerry, is an extraordinary story teller. His intimate recollections of life in Brooklyn during the first fifty years of the 20th century draw readers into the story immediately. Each generation of Hirschs come alive in many large and small ways. The effect is touching, humorous, sad, delightful, and real.Joe Hirsch's ancestors came to America from czarist Russia to escape religious persecution. As Russian Jews, even initial poverty in Brooklyn was preferable to the brutal pogroms experienced in their homeland. Despite racial, religious, and ethnic segregation, the Hirsch family grew and thrived in their new land.Norman \\"Joe\\" Hirsch is the amazing central character of this story. As a boy he is the likeable, sensible, athletic and self reliant hero to his younger brother Billy. Joe, Billy, and friends grow up in Brooklyn during the 20s and 30s. Through them we get a close up view of what life was like for them day to day. And through older members of the family we experience the socio-political climate of early 20th century America, and their concerns about yet another war festering in Europe.Joe and Billy Hirsch both enlist in 1942. Like most American boys of the time, they hold an innocent, idealistic world view. For certain, none of them could imagine the horrors they would see in battle. Through letters home, Jerry's commentary as related through family members, and Joe's diary entries, we see what they saw. Basic training, flight school, and realistic accounts of bombing runs under heavy fire are harrowing. Through their words, we live the war with them, feel the fear and experience the sorrow of losing comrades in foreign lands. When Lt. Joe Hirsch is shot down with his crew over Germany in 1944, he is only 21 years old. We grieve with his family and friends, feel that loss as surely as if he were one of our own. But the war does end, and the baton of hope is passed to a new generation of Hirschs by story's end.Passing the Baton is more than a memoir, more than just a charming, well written book. It's living history, rich and alive on every page. My compliments to the author for a book exceedingly well written, entertaining, and educational. This book gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Passing the Baton: The Norman \\"Joe\\" Hirsch Story","review":"Yes, it's a very readable, attention grabbing mixture, bitter & sweet.

As for the translations, the rhyme scemes used for the different characters and parts of the plot make the play come to life.

In some plays for instance the names are changes, or a character is said to have a Bronx accent! The translators goal was to have lively and performable versions, and they do, so this may not bother everyone.Each play has a simple stage diagram, and some notes on what the stage should be like (eg, the first house should be grand and imposing, but the neighboring house is small and unimpressive). The stage directions are good.

If you can read the Latin yourself but want something that better conveys the spirit and humor of the comedies, this is a good choice. I used this in tandem with the original Latin for a 300 level Latin class, and it was useful in that it contrasted well with our own rather stilted and unfunny translations."},{"Title":"Professional PHP Web Services","review":"While I know what Web Services are and how they could help me, the code examples in the book are really bad. For one, it feels that some of the code was written by one person and explained by another. Also, the lack of continuity in code style decreases after each chapter (obviously from all the different people that wrote this thing). Some of the introduction chapters were well written, only because they didn't talk about code so much. This book's major failure was the lack of case studies.

It introduces wide range about the relationship between PHP and the web services, it's a good base to start. However I have to tell, that there are some bugs (or the descriptions are not clear, don't know) in the example sources, for example I've found one in the chapter about security (Chapter 6).This is a problem, but with it, I still could recommend this book for everybody not familiar with Web Services, and would like to learn all the related technologies. As it is true at other books, too: you can learn all these things from the web, but you can just find these together in this (or other) book, and you can read it conveniently at your bed with your girlfriend. :)"},{"Title":"Professional PHP Web Services","review":"...the content is actually quite good. I was surprised to see that there were more OO examples and the book's structure was well thought-out. I wouldn't expect too much from a book on PHP Web Services however, since PHP has a lot of maturing to do and you won't learn much else other than XML-RPC, SOAP and WSDL and how to use these technologies in PHP. I believe an amateur can learn these technologies using PHP in the better part of a day.Another gripe about the book is that it's the standard price of a Wrox book but it's only around 500 pages (unlike the usual 800-1000). If you refer to initial arguments, where is that extra money going for these missing pages? Surely not to the contributors.In any case, please think twice before you purchase the book. Not only is this a highly specialized topic that can be easily learned without the book, but the overall value and ethical consequences make it even worse.

I wish some of these chapters were put into a 'generic Web Services' book, since they are pretty good when PHP isn't concerned, but as for everything else - it pretty much stinks.I'm tired of the Wrox books. What do they do? - slave drive would-be computer scientist from pakistan to pump out the book that they do? There isn't quality or quantity here. It just's a poorly thought out book.

The truth is that this book is quite good, but due to the circumstances surrounding the entire thing, there is a lot of negativity in the air.

How dare she enforce human standards on her sweet, good-natured lab? Sure, he was a little barrel-waisted, but so what? Let the dog be free!That was twenty years ago when I was a young pup myself and hated society's pressure on me to be thin. I have a bit more perspective now. I also have a dachshund. I've read that dachshunds are prone to back problems as they get older, and that excess fat aggravates this unhappy condition.But it's so easy to slip him a little extra dog food or drop a bit of my dinner into his dish after I eat. He loves people food. He also loves training snacks, and the mini-treats in the car, and the food stuffed into his kong to keep him busy when left alone.He began to expand. I knew I had to take steps. To paraphrase that notorious radio psychologist, Dr. Laura, \\"I am my dog's owner.\\" I bought this book to help me be a better guardian of my pooch's girth.It's a very nutritious book! My favorite tidbit is how to know if your dog is really fat of just, ahem, \\"big-boned.\\" And I also know how much food to feel my dog, and how to read dog food labels. No more dumping food in his dish according to how hungry he looks or how especially fond I am of him at that moment. I guess one of the things I need pounding into my head is that overfeeding is not the same as love. If I want my dog to live long and prosper, I'd better control his diet and give him enough exercise. The author gives lots of ideas on exercise for all kinds of different types of households. Just do it! It matters.Halfway through the book, there's a startling picture of a fat daschshund with my dog's face and coloring but a lot more pudge. I look at my dog and see his still boundless energy and healthy spine, and I know that picture is what I want to avoid.I'd like more discussion of different theories of nutrition, because a perusal of the Internet discloses fierce argument over this point, and it seems hard to figure out.

Each represents Jesus as he was seen in different eras, spanning centuries. Each is lovingly painted with the features defined by its era. Suddenly, a white-haired madman comes rushing into the gallery. One by one, he tears each portrait from the wall. He does not merely break them in half, he destroys them utterly. Then, when the walls are empty, the man walks over and places something on the wall. It is HIS version of Jesus. Slowly, a crowd gathers around the image. History itself holds its breath.

They say Schweitzer concludes Jesus was a deluded faker, rendering Christianity a fairy tale. They wish! Nothing could be farther from the truth.In truth, Schweitzer concludes that if someone attempts to live up to the ethical perfection of Jesus, they will discover for themselves \\"who he is.\\" And to be sure, \\"who he is,\\" for Schweitzer, was certainly not a deluded faker. If Jesus' apocalyptic beliefs make him deluded, then most of antiquity, including the Romans, can be called deluded. They all believed in cosmic cycles and world-ending epochs. Was Jesus a faker? Absurd. His absolute sincerity was demonstrated in his willingness to be crucified.Don't listen to polemic interpretations. Let Schweitzer speak for himself. He wrote, in this book's conclusion ...\\"Jesus, in the knowledge that He is the coming Son of Man, lays hold of the wheel of the world to set it moving on that last revolution which is to bring all ordinary history to a close. It refuses to turn, and he throws Himself upon it. Then it does turn; and crushes Him. Instead of bringing in the eschatological conditions, he has destroyed them. The wheel rolls onward, and the mangled body of the one immeasurably great man, who was strong enough to think of himself as the spiritual ruler of mankind and to bend history to his purpose, is hanging upon it still. That is his victory and his reign.\\""},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"We live in an age that hav invented the telephone, the tv, the computer and numerous electronic gadgets thefore we reson what did the people of the 18th century know. well it seems like quite a lot Frudian phycology, Einstein, Darwin and a lot in music.

To be more specific it is clear that our conception of what Jesus taught and beleived about himself does not coinside with what most christians belive and are certain they know.

Obviously, he and they were considerably smarter."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"Although quite long and involved, this book represents a true landmark in the history of the study of the life of Jesus Christ.When it was published, it literally became the period at the end of a sentence - in this case, the book that ended what had come to be known as the First Quest for the Historical Jesus.Schweitzer explained clearly that this quest had ended in failure, as 19th century German theologians failed to find the Jesus the longed to find - a man who was rather suspiciously like themselves - liberal, enlightened and most certainly not the eschatalogical Son of God.It is rare that a single book can have such a great impact on the theological discourse of its time, but Schweitzer's book changed the course of New Testament investigation for at least the first half of the 20th century.This book is a technical investigation, and certainly not for everyone, but for those who have the patience and the desire to work their way through the pages of Schweitzer's Quest, the reasons for the failure of the First Quest will become quite clear.Now that we are in the middle of what has been called the Third Quest for the Historical Jesus, Schweitzer's book is perhaps more relevant than ever.For the real historical Jesus, we should all spend more time reading the Gospels, which were written by the very men who knew and walked with Jesus in his lifetime.They still stand."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"For over one hundred years people have been misinterpreting this book, or at least focusing on a secondary issue. Yes, Schweitzer does show how views of Jesus mirror the culture of the writers who write about him. But that is not as important as the fact that the Jesus who emerges from scholarship is probably not very appealing to modern people. He was not a loving Saviour giving his life for others. He was a Jewish apocalyptic prophet interested only in divine intervention to save Israel and destroy the Romans and other ungodly gentiles. He failed in that God did not intervene, neither to save Israel not to save Jesus from death. Thus Christianity as we know it is a hoax, a delusion, a fairy tale. This is the meaning of Schweitzer's great discovery."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"The Quest of the Historical Jesus made me question my faith.

Let me provide an orthodox counterview.Schweitzer spends 18 chapters going through various Germanic attempts at trying to remove all miracle and supernatural content within the Gospel texts while maintaining some coherent historical documentation that corrects the historical record.The elimination of miracle and the requisite substitution of storyline from the imaginations of these men to fill the gaps leave Schweitzer to admit in more than one instance the ridiculousness of the \\"new history\\".Schweitzer, however misses the starting point of what is at issue in his book. He presumes as axiomatic that neither miracles nor a theophany can happen in history. By definition this cannot be axiomatic because many great minds throughout history stedfastly believe both to be possible.At a minimum Schweitzer should have presented the circular argument of Hume (\\"Miracles do not exist because I haven't witnessed any, therefore miracles cannot exist\\") before he began to present 18 meandering chapters of various theories from arm-chair historians postulated 19 centuries after the fact.A tiring theme that Schweitzer harps on and on about is the sequence of events in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew and John. However, the only Gospel that claims to record events in historical sequence is Luke and therefore Schweitzer is making an argument where there is none.Opposed to the arm-chair theologians is the veracity of the text claimed to be told by eyewitnesses or close associates of eyewitnesses to the events and the price paid by them (death in over 90% of the cases) for the story they held to.\\"The Quest of The Historical Jesus\\" will confirm, regardless of which side of the debate you are on, the following points:1) The belief on Jesus Christ is a matter of Faith.2) The Gospels stripped of miracles and the divinity of Christ become nonsense and incoherent.3) The Christ of Schweitzer, who is merely a philosophical ideal of the early church rather than the God/Man in history, is no threat to the spirit of any age and does not get in the way of man being \\"the measure of all things.\\"It should not surprise that the Early Church and the power of its Miraculous Jesus of History, from a position of weakness, was able to transform the Roman Empire into the Holy Roman Empire, while the German Church of Schweitzer and his contemporaries with their philosophical ideal, from a position of strength and acceptance, could not withstand the forces of evil in Germany that would haunt mankind in the 20th century."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"I found this to be excruciatingly boring.

Schweitzer demonstrates how previous research was really an (unwitting) attempt by liberal and rationalist theologians to proof-text a Jesus who would embarrass orthodox Protestantism and serve as a figurehead for liberal (&quot;Fatherhood of God, Brotherhood of Man&quot;) Christianity. Schweitzer showed how each historical reconstruction of Jesus uncannily matched the beliefs and agenda of the scholar in question. But Schweitzer knew the Christ of orthodoxy was not the historical Jesus either. One could only discover the latter by being willing to find the unexpected, and Schweitzer thought he found a Jesus who was a prophet of the end of the world, who expected to judge the earth as the Son of Man, and who died tragically mistaken. Even so, he still serves as a beacon of spiritual force for the ages. As does Schweitzer's great book!"},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"This landmark classic demonstrates the cliche of \\"the painting telling more about the painter than the subject being painted\\". People use the gospels as a mirror for their own beliefs and reconstruct Jesus accordingly in their self-images. Schweitzer's Jesus, by contrast, stands on a foreign landscape of apocalyptic fanaticism -- a deluded prophet who thought he was God's instrument sent to announce the end of history; burning with apocalyptic zeal, marching to Jerusalem, confident he could force God's hand and usher in the kingdom through a voluntary death. But it didn't happen. Jesus was crushed by the system he defied, and the drama ended on the cross.Even if Schweitzer's portrait of Jesus is a bit extreme, he got the basics right -- Jesus the eschatological prophet -- and closed the curtains on the liberal quest for Jesus. He was a prophet himself, for we have another liberal quest today in the work of the Jesus Seminar. Instead of Jesus the liberal Protestant, the Seminar gives us Jesus the liberal humanist, disguised as a non-apocalyptic sage. For more up-to-date works which follow Schweitzer's apocalyptic prophet, see E.P. Sanders' \\"The Historical Figure of Jesus\\", Paula Fredriksen's \\"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\\", and Dale Allison's \\"Jesus of Nazareth: Millenarian Prophet\\". Allison's book, in particular, is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"I don't think the above review understood the central theme or the historical importance of this monumental work.

The result is a normative portrayal of a &quot;Christ of Faith,&quot; NOT a &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; In fact, the &quot;real&quot; Jesus recedes into historical background as the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke, &amp; John also project their own values &amp; interpretation onto Jesus' life. Who is Jesus, then? That is a question of faith, not a question of history."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"This is the greatest book ever written about the historical Jesus, and it should be required reading for every college student. It is brilliant, profound, thrilling, and fairly easy to read (no Greek quotations to puzzle over, and lots of colorful phrases). The book is an intellectual detective story embedded in the solid framework of a chronological survey, vividly illuminating the theories of dozens of courageous New Testament scholars from about 1750 to 1900.Schweitzer spends little time on supernaturalist theologians, Catholic or Protestant, and their ancient mythological god, \\"Jesus Christ.\\" Instead he focuses on pioneering, critical, inquiring scholars such as Reimarus, Bahrdt, Venturini, Paulus, Hase, Schleiermacher, Strauss, Weisse, Bauer, Renan, Ghillany, and others, who sincerely sought the real Jesus of history, long covered up with magic and metaphysics.Conservative and/or supernaturalist Christians often like to claim that Schweitzer's book shows how previous Jesus researchers mistakenly depicted a Jesus who merely reflected themselves and their own soft modern times - a \\"gentle Jesus meek and mild,\\" or such like. That generalization is partly true, but mostly very misleading. The \\"liberalism\\" of those 18th and 19th century scholars actually consisted of their common naturalism, their search for natural explanations for the bizarre stories in the gospels. They were not so much mistaken as they were correct (or at least more correct than their supernaturalist opponents). They were not so much failures as they were successes, even heroes. Schweitzer emphasizes their collective heroism on the first page of his book. And his own naturalistic understanding of the man Jesus as a stark and mistaken prophet of apocalypse certainly has more in common with the other naturalistic views he surveys than with the entrenched supernaturalist camp.By way of preparation, anyone not very familiar with the four gospels should first spend several days carefully reading all of them (or at the very least Mark and John) and taking good notes before beginning to read Schweitzer's dense book. That preparation will vividly reveal some of the glaring differences (and similarities) among the gospels. The historical reality behind those largely fictional gospels is the major focus of the scholars whom Schweitzer discusses. He makes it clear that the different versions of the mind of Jesus and the course of his career depicted in each of the four gospels are as much to blame for the many different scholarly \\"lives\\" of Jesus as are those scholars and their times.After reading Schweitzer's \\"Quest,\\" or at least a sizeable portion of it, please share it with friends or family members and ask them to do likewise for others. Spread the good word. Discuss it at length. We Americans especially, given our gullibility and inclination to extremes, urgently need to know the sobering facts behind our ancient religious legends."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"THE QUEST OF THE HISTORICAL JESUS is Albert Schweitzer's monumental attempt to review and comment on the research done on the historical Jesus mostly in the nineteenth century. The book covers the work of Herman Samuel Reimarus, Paulus, David Friedrich Strauss, Bruno Bauer and many others.Strauss was particularly important since his analysis of the Gospels' miraculous stories was that they were mythical. For this he was attacked by other scholars of his time although his basic idea about the mythical character of the biblical miracles has steadily gained popularity among academics. Schweitzer, on the other hand, saw Jesus as a prophet who had a strong apocalyptic message for the world. Everything Jesus said and did was influenced by his belief that the end was near, according to Schweitzer.Schweitzer's work helped to lay the groundwork for future research on the historical Jesus. All subsequent research, including that of the Jesus Seminar, has owed a debt to Albert Schweitzer."},{"Title":"The quest of the historical Jesus;: A critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede,","review":"Though it could benefit from 20th-century discoveries about the nature of Jewish apocalyptic, Schweitzer's majestically written, often devastating analysis of the covert theology-as-history of German academia is timeless. He gives all a fair shake, particularly Strauss, certainly the 19th century's boldest and most original quester, and finally shows that all are insufficient to account for the (apparently quite embarrassing) fact of Jesus' intense eschatology. His work is still applicable to the innumerable \\"liberal\\" portraits we're treated to nowadays (one thinks especially of John Dominic Crossan, though I find much of his work laudatory for other reasons), to say nothing of the televangelist's Jesus or the nauseating, \\"your best friend\\" youth-group Jesus.

Almost every current book on the historical Jesus from the most conservative to the most liberal references this book as a starting point. As well, most seminaries and graduate programs in New Testament have this listed as required reading.The book flows very well. The first half of the book is largely a summary of the 18th and 19th century biographies of Jesus. Schweitzer details their methodology and the author's social situation and also provides his own commentary on the matter. The second half of the book is his own ideas and thoughts on the situation.Whether or not you agree or disagree with Schweitzer, this is a good starting point for the issue, whether or not you end up reading John Dominic Crossan or N.T.

I've always loved stories like this, and especially about the way God can use printed words to slip quietly into the hearts and minds of so many peoplein so many ways, and to accomplish such marvelous miracles. I tell you, I lapped this book up!Victor Maxwell, a pastor in Ireland, brings us the story of a quiet, unassuming man, named Ernie Allen, who had a passion to win souls to Christ, and who started by preparing little leaflets with some articles on revival by Charles G. Finneyand Reuben A. Torrey. He advertised in newspapers, and offered to send a booklet, &quot;Pardon for Sin and Assurance of Peace with God,&quot; to those who requested it. Such requests began to flood in, and Ernie and his wife, Kathleen, kept printing them in their living room, and mailing them out. They called it the Revival Movement.When Ernie heard of Every Home Crusade, he lined up volunteers to take the tracts to every door, neighbourhood by neighbouhood in Ireland's cities and rural communities. As the work outgrew their home, they moved progressively to a larger house, an old church building, and eventually had a great big literature factory built in Belfast. This book details the steps of their growth, and tells many wonderful stories of the responses around the world.You see, as people in other countries heard that they could get large quantities of tracts and gospel booklets from Ernie Allen, they began to request them. Without ever charging them a penny, he produced and shipped all they asked for. The Lord saw to it that supporters continued to send in donations to cover these costs. He never ever went into debt, he just hired helpers to run their own presses as they got to needing them, and they kept rolling out literature to meet the demands."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"I was excited to find this book! Great communication and shipping from seller.This is possibly one of the most important collections of post 1950's pop science-fiction. Harlan Ellison challenged himself and his peers to create this volume. Anyone interested in putting this book into context of the science-fiction genre should read \\"Science Fiction At Large\\" (edited by Peter Nicholls)."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Tremendous collection. Many great imaginative stories, especially \\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" by Fritz Leiber. What a piece of work! I'd recommend this collection to anyone who digs off the wall ideas, especially the above mentioned story; amazing. To me, that one story is worth the price of this volume itself."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"In the prelude, Harlan Ellison describes \\"a 2nd Revolution\\", those science fiction writers that emerged out of the 60's and led SF into a new direction. This is their book, a testament to imaginations of the post-Golden Age thinkers and doers. With '33' compositions on everything under the sun, this work brings a broad spectrum of what-may-be thought and speculation to our view. As you can get a list of authors from the web I won't go into detail. But if you are looking for the very best in SF thought this a good stop. The stories are still on top 40 years into their future."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"This is a difficult review for me to write. I really didn't like the collection though I wanted to. I believe the problem is that the success of this book has made it seem nowhere near dangerous 35 years later. They pushed the envelope, now everbody goes there and their works seem commonplace.On the plus side we get some early works from Zelazny and Delany, Harlan's acerbic, biting introductions cannot hide the love he actually feels for his other writers.There are some quite good stories in here, typically these stories are where the author didn't feel the need to try to be &quot;edgy&quot;, or &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;relevant&quot; and let the pushing of the mores come from the story, not the other way around.The stories where it seems the authors wanted to be &quot;dangerous&quot; don't come across well now. They are either irrelevant, naive and some even seem to come across as little children playing potty-mouth in the absence of their parents. When the stories are bad, they are very, very bad.Good works do abound in this collection, thus the three stars. However some are so bad you'll wonder if it's worth continuing. The last stories are generally stronger. The stories that begin the collection are the duller and poorer ones.I am disappointed I did not find this to be revolutionary, and it does not live up to its hype, nor legend. It is a look at a certain time in the field, a time when the style of writing changed, or tried to change with some good stories and some bad ones. That's all it is now I'm sorry to say."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"This book is stunning. Most of it is still shocking to this day. Maybe not amongst sf writers and readers. (Certainly not after Delaney's Dalghren.) But in the increasingly hypocritical and fundamentalist world we live in this book still lays down the gauntlet and says, \\"Non serviam!\\" The first story, by Lester Del Rey, has humanity hunting down and imprisoning God. Do you seriously see anyone in the clique that runs the Whitehouse for the foreseeable future paying people to say these sorts of things? And Poul Anderson's story takes the sf formula (an average everyday phenomenon seen in a new way) and applies it to incest for incendiary results.For my money the best story in the book is Phillip K. Dick's. The guy was the only American to report on the sacred honestly, in every one of his books. Not only is God a killer. He's the Devil. It's about time someone said it.Ballard's meditation on sex is a close second best.There's a story by William S. Burroughs here about a doll house. It's the usual demented Burroughs stuff, complete with Satanic cackling, only without the cut-up method.Read this book if you want to clear out the cobwebs and confirm that you are thinking correctly after all."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"....is good in parts.I read about this anthology when I was in my teens, in the 1970s, but never encountered it until I literally fell over it second hand. A couple of quid swapped hands and there I had it...I too was diappointed in 'Riders of the Purple Wage' - but found a great deal of pleasure in reading less publcised stories like 'A gift for Juliette', 'Judas' and 'Shall the dust praise thee'. Fritz Leiber's 'Gonna roll the bones' was also a delight. I think my problem with this book was the number of stories that dropped in to the 'New Wave' of Science Fiction that was prevalent in the mid to late 1960s when this collection was first made. I guess I'm a fan of the 'flange and grommet' school of science fiction and find some of the sociological meanderings in this book to be a little pointless 40 years on.Is it as good as it's hype? In my opionion, No. But there are some good stories in here. It will entertain, inspire and infuriate you if you are interested in science fiction, and I guess that's all you can ask for from an anthology!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Some great stories, the kind where you can suspend disbelief, abound in this volumn. Most of the authors went on to bigger and better things."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Making a long, 33 page original anthology all good is going to be very difficult, and it is the later middle of this book that lets it down. Divided into three as another way of publishing it, Dangerous Visions 1, for example, averages 3.63. The rest of this, 3.32.The book does finish strongly, with several good stories. Given it is 40 odd years later you can see how many stories have been used again in other anthologies, etc., or at least those of have seen. In the main it is from the first part of the book, and the very end. Fritz Leiber's excellent Gonna Roll the Bones notwithstanding, if you want to call that a middle story.There are extensive story introductions by the editor, and as he points out when writing about Slesar and Ersatz, his intro to that story is considerably longer than the story itself.There are also authorial afterwords of varying lengths, as well as an extensive introduction on what a pain in the arse this book was to put together with dropouts, costs, lengths, stupid publishers putting it out of print because they did that to all booksbon general principle (and that was really silly given I think there are new editions now.)Certainly worth reading for historical reasons, if nothing else.Dangerous Visions : Evensong - Lester del ReyDangerous Visions : Flies - Robert SilverbergDangerous Visions : The Day After the Day the Martians Came - Frederik PohlDangerous Visions : Riders of the Purple Wage - Philip Jos&eacute; FarmerDangerous Visions : The Malley System - Miriam Allen deFordDangerous Visions : A Toy for Juliette - Robert BlochDangerous Visions : The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World - Harlan EllisonDangerous Visions : The Night That All Time Broke Out - Brian W.

If there is a way to find this story in another collection, I would recommend finding it there. The remainder of this book is not intended to be enjoyed. Instead it is intended as a rebellion against SF authors from the &quot;Golden Age&quot;.My suspicion is that Harlan Ellison intended to &quot;revolutionize&quot; SF with this book, but all he wound up doing was showing that revolutions start with ideas, not declaring &quot;Revolution!&quot;. The irony was that a &quot;Golden Age&quot; author, Leiber, wrote the only quality story in this anti-&quot;Golden Age&quot; book."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"I would give this book 0 stars except for the fact I've yet to finish it and may NEVER finish it. It's about as exciting as watching a trail of ants all day .First off, I am not one of those \\"pretentious readers\\" who disdain speculative fiction. In fact, I love it and enjoy very cutting edge material. So, with all the hoopla surrounding this book, I rushed to get it only to find the stories laughably bad and amateurish. Or perhaps that was the intent of the writers? To write such bad fiction and then pass it off as \\"way out there\\"?There is no craft evident in any of these stories. I've seen stoned readers at Open Mic nights exhibit more control over their writing. Take for instance, the supposed \\"Avant-Garde\\" and Hugo Award-winning \\"Riders of the Purple Wage\\" -- an overblown exercise on wordplay and silly scenarios that could've come out of a high school freshman's notebook. How such a mess won a Hugo is beyond me then again Philip K. Dick won for \\"Man in the High Castle\\" -- a novel ballooning with stereotypes and I. Ching ramblings.\\"If All Men Were Brothers\\" is another over-written joke. You trudge through reams of pages containing long, pointless dialogue until reaching the \\"Revelation.\\" Okay, I admit the author's theory is interesting, but my question remains: WHERE'S THE STORY??? I don't know why so many Sci-Fi writers feel that just putting forth a \\"theory\\" can substitute for story. Need one be reminded of the old adage: \\"Show don't Tell\\"?\\"Evensong\\" is another one of those pieces that relies on a twist ending. Written in a classic turgid style, e.g. -- \\"And cold horror curled thickly around him.\\", it also places far too much emphasis on a \\"shocking revelation\\" which actually is not all that shocking nor original.One last example -- \\"The Day After the Day the Martians Came.\\" I suppose Pohl expected us to be bowled over by the \\"twist,\\" the supplanting of racial hate? Give me a break. The story is concocted in such amateurish fashion -- guys at poker tables cracking jokes and all -- that it is completely bereft of any power. Also, his idea is asinine -- the idea that hatred towards some other life-form is better. Because HATE, I \\"hate\\" to tell you, is STILL HATE.Well, I could go on, but I won't. I just cannot understand all the praise for this book. It's like praising a Sunday comic strip as the \\"8th Wonder of the World.\\" If this collection was truly \\"avant-garde\\" in 1967, then all I can say is people must've been living in caves in 1967."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"The best part of this book is Harlan Ellison's introductions. He's got two for the book and one for each story. That makes 33 total. The man likes to write and it shows. Another thing that comes through is the respect that he holds for his writers. He truly loves them and their stories. It's hard for the reader to not get caught up when the editor himself is such an adamant cheerleader.I have to admit I didn't find much of it dangerous, but I could see that that wouldn't have been true back when it was first published. We're different now and what we've seen in our entertainment has changed much in the last 40 years. We've matured. Most of the stories are well written, though, and it doesn't matter if they are no longer dangerous. Carol Emshwiller's writing style is as fresh now as it was back in the 60s. Same with PKD. Great discoveries for me include the Hollywood writer: Howard Rodman; the weird writer: David R. Bunch; the beautiful writer: Roger Zelazny; the tried and true writer: Lester Del Rey.The most dangerous story here was Theodore Sturgeon's. It was a tale of accepted incest. Still controversial and weird in my opinion. I am a fan of Sturgeon's work, but I must say, this story felt overwritten to me. A disappointment almost. He's a great writer and I enjoyed the ride, but it did go on a bit.Good book to have in your collection because there are so many references to it. And when it comes to science fiction, anything new is old after a decade, so you can't expect it to remain astounding, amazing, dangerous forever.The main thing is the literary quality. It's tops. That more than anything else has kept this book on the required reading pile. You could have worse homework."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"I originally bought the three volumes of this book (in the UK anyway) back in 1976. From then on I have rated HE THE most important writer of this time, and not just of America. Although lumped into the &quot;Sc-Fi&quot; genre this is not science fiction but speculative fiction as put out by writers who write, amongst other things, science fiction stories. Thirty five years have passed since these stories emerged and some of them are not going to have the impact they had in 1967 obviously. However, take your time and you will appreciate what was being done then and how it shaped writings of the future. Then go and search out 'Again Dangerous Visions' to complete your collection. What ever you do don't mention 'The Final Dangerous Visions' to anyone! This book is essential to any collection of 20th and 21st Century literature."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"This anthology resulted from Harlan Ellison's asking 33 of the sf authors recognized as the best in the genre at that time to submit stories which they felt could not be published elsewhere.

The scarcity of copies in used book stores almost certainly results from readers being unwilling to part with their copies."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Bravo to ibooks for bringing back this classic book of sci-fi stories written by some of the best writers in the genre and edited by a modern master, Harlan Ellison. If you're even a moderate fan of science fiction you owe it to yourself to get this book."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Alrighty! It's about time someone got this book back on the shelves. Leave it to Ibooks, who is bringing a lot of lost classics back into print. Dangerous Visions is the 35-year-old award-winning anthology edited by Harlan Ellison, in which the hot writers of the time could show off some stuff that likely wouldn't appear in the regular publications. There are some enjoyable stories here, and I won't go into detail since the other reviewers cover that. I will agree, however, that some stories aren't quite up to snuff, but the good ones more than make up for it.I am especially happy that this printing contains the original header illustrations by Leo and Diane Dillon. When this reprint was announced and I saw the new cover, I was worried that all trace of the Dillons would be gone. That just wouldn't be right, since the book was originally dedicated to them. I wasn't let down! One comment involving this: it appears that instead of doing new typesetting for these larger trade paperback pages, the publisher may have simply enlarged the original pages and printed them as is. Where the type for the introductions is very crisp and clear, the type and headers for the stories looks oversized and bold. I could be wrong, however...On to the cover! Be aware that there are THREE different versions(that I know of, maybe more?). The first is of a woman peering through a wall of windows. The second is a fractal type of pattern. The third, which I purchased, is a very impressive photo of a barefoot man in coat & tie with daVinci wings on his arms preparing to leap off of a cliff. For all three versions, the back cover shows the full image of the original dust jacket by the Dillons. All in all, a very attractive package... a reprint done right!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"First, I should make it clear that I really like this book. I bought it when it was new back in 1967, and I thought the stories were terrific and novel, and the commentary Ellison provided was both entertaining and informative. If nothing else, it helps form a picture of the times - and there's where we start approaching the qualms I have about the book.An anthology of original stories, no matter how good, is a time capsule. This is true of this book, as well as other original anthologies of the time, such as Damon Knight's _Orbit_ series and the _New Worlds_ quarterlies. Such an anthology contains a snapshot of the period and the Zeitgeist; and the yoking together of all these dissimilar stories written within a few years of one another certainly gives me that sensation after all this time. People who are interested in the literary history of sf or the cultural Zeitgeist of the late '60s - either for personal or scholarly reasons - would find this book valuable.However, when such considerations are eliminated, I ask myself who would want to read this book in this format today, and why? I reassert, it is a good book of stories. The stories by Fritz Leiber (\\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\"), Samuel R. Delany (\\"Aye, and Gomorrha\\"), and Phillip Jose Farmer (\\"Riders of the Purple Wage\\") won Hugos and/or Nebulas. Other stories, such as Silverberg's \\"Flies,\\" Zelazny's \\"Auto da F?,\\" Bloch's \\"A Toy for Juliette\\", Ellison's own \\"The Prowler in the City...\\", (to name but a few) are better than just \\"good.\\" Even the average stories seem mostly of high quality. (Farmer's award-winner, \\"Riders of the Purple Wage,\\" highly regarded in its day, seems to have aged a bit more than others.) The book's excellence was recognized in its time, and it won numerous awards.Yet with the passage of time, its excellence has been tempered by familiarity. The best of these stories have become widely known in the intervening decades. Widely reprinted, the best are practically all available elsewhere. If a reader simply wants to read, for example, Leiber's \\"Gonna Roll the Bones,\\" there are other sources for the story.Yet the book had purposes beyond presenting a collection of good stories. It was a salvo in the American version of the New Wave. One of the book's avowed purposes was to be transgressive. At the time it was; but after all these years, it seems much less so. The problem is that the book is to some extent a victim of its own success. The battle over editorial taboos of adult subject matter and styles in sf was (at least in part) won. What once seemed outrageous no longer really shocks. The other part of the book's intention, to nudge sf out of its well-travelled formulae, has perhaps been less successful in the long term.So the book has lost a little of its significance. It almost seems like a document from an sf alternate history - this is where we were headed in '67, but we changed course somewhere along the way. . . .For all that, I still like the book a great deal, and it is incredibly important in science fiction history. Obviously, there are questions that did not exist when the book was new."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"I read this as a teenager in the 1970s and wanted to reread it; sadly, it's aged pretty poorly.It's hard to get past the repeated \\"shocks\\" involving male homosexuality - including a story in which a character is so horrified by a sexual advance that he runs out into a nuclear wasteland to die, because hey, that's better than saying, \\"Thanks, but no thanks!\\" Layer in some typical 1960s sexism, and you have something... well, something surprisingly lacking in vision. SF writers could imagine strange worlds with different values and alien beings, but not woman who weren't just secretaries or gay people. It's a bit sad, really. And given that it's punctuated by Ellison's intros - every third or fourth one reminding us that he's not gay! not! but he'll tell you about his 147 bad marriages to women! - it just becomes more cringe-inducing. (I'm not saying he is gay, by the way, just that his obsession with the topic is a bit tragic.)All those attitudes, which were part of the culture in which these writers were living, were just a fact of life; I guess the reason they make many of these dangerous visions seem amazingly limited, whereas in non-SF fiction or films they just feel like part of the period.There are, however, some gems scattered throughout the book, and the quality of the writing is generally high; I would suggest just skipping all the intro material about how mind-blowing and challenging it all is, and enjoy them as relics."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Well, it's harlan ellison. what more can be said?

You can't keep those who contributed waiting forever."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"The 1960's gave birth to the idea that human actions might reach a scale that could destroy the human race, create a permanent dictatorship, permanently damage the environment, or otherwise produce a large, irrevocable, novel disaster. This theme weaves through Ellison's landmark anthology. From total machine-driven war to psychological destruction of the human race, most of the stories explore new ways for people to screw things up -- without a happy ending.Even the most conventional story in the book, \\"The Jigsaw Man\\" by Larry Niven, extrapolates a current trend to an unhappy future (at least for the protagonist).This is not a bad thing. Golden Age SF is full of stories where the future is good and the protagonists overcome the central challenge. The time was ripe for a collection of dystopian stories.And some of the stories fall outside this theme. After all, Ellison's stated goal is fresh, taboo-breaking stories, and there's more to that than bad views of the future. Theodore Sturgeon breaks taboos and stays upbeat. Norman Spinrad writes a psychedelic fable and makes it work. Philip Jose Farmer's story is so weird that I couldn't even understand the first few pages, and I didn't even notice when it did start to make sense. And Fritz Leiber doesn't break any taboos but damn his story swings.Ellison got Asimov to write an introduction, a classy touch -- a way of showing respect to the old school while starting a new one."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"This classic anthology of speculative fiction (a deeper form that standard sci-fi) deserves the praise and influence it has enjoyed since 1967. These stories were indeed dangerous for their era, and most of them have proven to be well ahead of their time, retaining the power of expanding your literary horizons even today. Some of these stories are downright shocking - including the submissions from Miriam Allen deFord, Robert Bloch, and Carol Emshwiller. Others are bizarre to the point of great insight - like the stories from Brian W. Aldiss, Larry Eisenberg, and Norman Spinrad. Others have the great social commentary and human drama that most sci-fi writers would kill to be capable of - especially the submissions from Frederick Pohl and Howard Rodman.The true key to this compilation is the editing work of Harlan Ellison, whose sarcastic and caustic personality shines through almost every page, even though he only wrote one of the stories himself. (That isn't self-glamorization, because his submission is an endorsed sequel to Bloch's story.) Ellison's introductions to each story combine the best in praising and roasting, and he certainly located many fascinating writers. Here we can see up-and-comers who later went on to greater things, along with intriguing unknowns who encourage where-are-they-now speculation. Another groundbreaking aspect of this collection is Ellison's use of afterwords by each author to comment on their own stories. This is usually successful except for a few cases of self-aggrandizement by the writers, and at least one attempt to explain a sub-par story (J.G. Ballard). Aside from a few minor clunkers, there is just one story that may have once been dangerous but is now a flop. That's the 70-plus-page novella from Philip Jose Farmer, which has aged wretchedly with an overload of creaky 60's politics and an unreadably faddish writing style. That's about the only story here that's not still capable of opening new horizons all these decades later."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Say what you will about Harlan Ellison, but you've got to admit he's got great taste.I was lucky enough to this up for a measly $.75 at a local used bookstore. Believe me, it was money well spent.There are a few duds in this collection (doesn't every anthology have some?), but they are by far outweighed by the gems. Some examples of the latter: the outrageous Joycean wit of Philip Jose Farmer's &quot;Riders Of The Purple Wage&quot;, the dream-like beauty of Carol Emshwiller's &quot;Sex And/Or Mr. Morrison&quot;, John Sladek's shockingly prophetic &quot;The Happy Breed&quot;, and Kris Neville's Salingeresque humor in &quot;From The Government Printing Office&quot;.If you like science fiction, or just enjoy well-crafted stories, by all means - seek this out."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Too many good and great stories in this one to list in this review.

Many daring, not before tolerated ideas.At the time these stories were written they were considered _dangerous_. They remained dangerous for a long time and when I read them in these days I can see why. Innovating and shocking they still are, well some of them. A great read and necessary reading for SF lovers.This book has also useful for-and afterwords.Lately, many o.o.p. books are instilled with new life, but I don't think this will be available long. It can't hurt to have a bit of a history of SF on your shelves. However, it remains a period book.

The culture and SF have evolved quite a bit in that time. That said, its still a pretty good collection of stories, and even more interesting as a piece of SF history.Harlan Ellison deserves a lot of credit for preserving this book as it was, resisting the temptation to update it (like certain directors have futily tried to update their older movies). This includes his introductions, which are written in the venacular of the time, dig, (and which less secure writers might have been embarassed by). To be honest, I found them the most entertaining part of the book, and they give the reader a great insight into the time in which they were written."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"This is Harlan Ellison's ground-breaking 60s SF anthology for which he invited writers to explore \\"dangerous\\" themes that were generally considered taboo at that time. Even now, many of these tales still retain the capacity to shock. Like most anthologies, the quality of the content is uneven, but the overall result is elevated by Ellison's story introductions, the afterwords to each story by the writers themselves, and the general sense that one is reading a serious attempt to push the genre in a more significant direction. Standouts include stories by Ellison himself, Fritz Leiber, David R. Bunch, Sonya Dorman, JG Ballard, and Norman Spinrad. Interestingly, the only real stinkers in the book are produced by veteran writers: Theodore Sturgeon, Damon Knight, and Poul Anderson."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Good Lord, it's been forty years or more since \\"Dangerous Visions\\" hit the stores. Hardly seems possible, especially for a book that was specifically designed to bring science fiction current with the modern world.According to Harlan Ellison, who edited this volume and its companion piece, \\"Again, Dangerous Visions\\", speculative fiction in 1968 had a problem with synchronization. Many authors had by then spent some little time dealing with the same issues that the world faced, such as civil rights, the retreat of colonialism and sexual freedom. Unfortunately, a lot of magazine editors, having come of age when such things were still taboo, couldn't bring themselves to publish stories on those subjects. What's more, because most of the audience at that time was getting its sf from anthologies rather than magazines, people were continuing to read good but older stories rather than the current stuff. The market for stories that confronted the contemporary world was artificially suppressed. An anthology of brand-new material, designed specifically to tackle previously taboo subjects, would bring things up to date as quickly as might be.In short, \\"Dangerous Visions\\" was too ambitious for its own good, and produced a number of unforeseen results that didn't necessarily do the sf field any favors. In particular, over the years following the book's publication, a fair number of authors and publishers came to assume, not that the sf genre was free to do as it pleased, but that a new system of rules had emerged. All too many stories in the following period took on bizarre, occasionally nauseating settings, extremely unpleasant characters, inevitable sexual oddities and downbeat conclusions. It takes a highly disciplined fan to immerse himself or herself in such material regularly, and a certain portion of the sf audience fell away.Now, it has to be said that a fair proportion of the stories in \\"Dangerous Visions\\" bear some responsibility for this state of affairs. Several of them, let's face it, are rather nauseating in their settings, characters and conclusions. However, if the genre as a whole decided that this sort of thing was worth imitating to the point of driving the audience away, that's not the fault of the collection or of Harlan Ellison. Indeed, Ellison did his level best to remind people that \\"Dangerous Visions\\" was not a prescription for authors to follow. There was no \\"new wave\\" in sf, he stated - rather, each author in the \\"Dangerous Visions\\" series was to be considered an individual \\"new wave\\", giving permission to future writers of sf to deal with whatever issues and styles they cared to. Some did.So, getting back to the original collection, did it accomplish what it intended to? Did it bring sf up to date with its world? On the whole, yes, although not every author succeeded in this way.In 1968, for instance, the United States found itself confronting the violence inherent in its own racism, something that sf had seemed to ignore. On the other hand, a form of prose that includes alien life on a regular basis has an easy way of facing the Other if it cares to take advantage of it, an opportunity that Frederik Pohl and a few others jumped on here. In other forms of oppression, the gay-rights movement had only just begun to make itself felt, but Samuel R. Delany, Poul Anderson and Carol Emshwiller dealt with it, if only metaphorically.It's surely not a coincidence that four authors - Philip K. Dick, Lester del Rey, Damon Knight and John Brunner - dealt in similar ways with the weakening influence of religion in those years. Others faced down the growing threat of sexual violence, including Robert Bloch, Robert Silverberg and Ellison himself. And, of course, not all violence was sexual either in the world or in this collection, as we might see in the work of Joe Hensley, Miriam Allen deFord, David R. Bunch, Keith Laumer and Larry Niven.Indeed, although there was plenty of unpleasantness for the world and these authors to face, some of them made it their business to do so with humor and a certain kind of poetry, such as Harry Slesar, Larry Eisenberg, and Philip Jose Farmer. And, inevitably, some authors didn't quite rise to the occasion. Opinion will differ on who these latter were, but even if you like the Roger Zelazny tale you have to admit that it's nothing more than a curious fantasy. He was considered at the time to be a leading sf stylist, so that's rather disappointing. Less surprising is the fact that many of the weaker stories come from unknown or little-known names like Kris Neville and James Cross, but it's a bit of a shock that some true master, like Brian Aldiss and R.A. Lafferty, dealt well with this opportunity to confront big issues.But no one can come up with a gem every time, however wide-open the field of play. At least almost all of the stories in \\"Dangerous Visions\\" are entertaining, if nothing else. And in any case, it shows that you don't have to turn the reader off when you deal with unpleasant facts.To a certain extent, the sf world has only just started to recover from the nuclear bomb that was \\"Dangerous Visions\\". You'll have to forgive me for saying so, but when an innocent little sf fairy tale like \\"Avatar\\" gets taken so seriously that some conservatives think of it as a threat to the American way of life, you can thank Ellison and these 30 men and women for the attention that such stories receive these days. At the very least, \\"Dangerous Visions\\" started some interesting conversations.Benshlomo says, They call it a risk because sometimes you fail big, and because sometimes you succeed big."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"This book blasts the lid off of all cliches that choke conventional (i.e. safe) SF. Even thirty odd years later the stories are vibrant and original, and you can see just where the current generation of hackmeisters got some of their best ideas. Find it, buy it, read it."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"Back in the sixties SF was in a bit of a state of flux, as a new generation of authors were growing up and trying to discover new things with the genre and becoming interested in more than just telling stories about the future or featuring weird aliens or spaceships. Often the stories were elusive in their telling, incorporating literary techniques or offbeat points of view that pushed the boundaries of what the genre could actually do. People like Michael Moorcock and his New Worlds magazine did their best to showcase the new breed, who were reacting against the relatively conservative old guard. Into this came Harlan Ellison and his big anthology. Ellison has always been a bit of a confrontational figure and it appears the easiest way to get him to do something is to tell him that it can't be done. So he decided to get together an anthology of all original stories featuring these new authors and stories that shoved up against the envelope, or broke through it completely. Thus we have the thirty five or so stories in this work, from a mix of authors that you've heard of before (Brian Aldiss, JG Ballard, Theodore Sturgeon, Poul Anderson, Samuel Delany, John Brunner, etc) and a good number that probably never became real famous. What also sets the anthology apart is the use of introductions and afterwards to bracket the stories, both to give Ellison a chance to talk the author up and the author a chance to give an final thoughts on the story you've just read, which helps makes it more than just a random collection of stories, while Ellison can be often overly effusive in his praise, he's never less than sincere (and his style is to be aggressively enthusiastic, that said, the new introduction where he talks about trying to update the biographical info for the author and had to stop when he realized how many of them were dead is a touching and sobering moment) and it helps give the anthology more of a theme by going into why he picked what stories he did. But what about the stories themselves? Range from pretty good to excellent, and it doesn't depend on how famous the author is, the relative no-names give as good as their more well-established brethren. A lot of the stories have become rather famous themselves in the years gone by, although the only one I can ever say I've read for sure is the Samuel Delany story, which is the perfect ending to the volume. There's an \\"anything goes\\" sense to the stories, and most of them were probably shocking in the day, although less so now these days (or maybe not, in the case of the Emshwiller and Sturgeon stories) since what they are reacting against doesn't really exist anymore, as SF has fragmented further, becoming more and less conservative. A handful of the stories may be too experimental for their own good, although you can give the author credit for trying (the two David Bunch tales come to mind, what is even going on in those?). Even so, the only real \\"product of its time\\" story is the award-winning and really long Philip Jose Farmer story, which is written in a style that just screams \\"aren't I ahead of my time?\\" and comes across as being revolutionary purely for the sake of being revolutionary. I can see why it won an award back then, because it's so stylistically different but today it just feels clunky and show-offy and \\"boy am I clever\\". But the rest are simply darn good stories, making their points in a few simple pages and being as different from one another as fingerprints, whether it's Zelazny's effortless flow, or Aldiss' way with an idea, or Dick's focused paranoia, or Sonya Dorman's unsettling intensity, or Sladek's chilling extrapolation, or even Ellison's forceful sequelizing, there is literally something for any SF fan to take away if they're open minded enough. If you don't like a story, simply keep reading and in a few pages something entirely different will come along. It certainly can't have the impact today that it did nearly forty years ago, but as a collection of quality fiction from your favorites and some who may become your new favorites, it is rare that you see so many good stories in one place. And even if you have read some elsewhere, there's an additional impact having them here in one place, as they play off and inform each other. Not that there's many contenders, but one of the best SF anthologies out there."},{"Title":"Dangerous Visions 35TH Anniversary Edition","review":"There are probably two good reasons for reading Dangerous Visions. One is for the stories themselves and the second is because it was a historic book in the science fiction genre. Ellison certainly accomplished his goal of publishing \\"dangerous\\" stories. However, not all \\"dangerous\\" stories are any good. There is a 50/50 chance that a dangerous story will be just bad as a non-dangerous one. Most stories in the collection are very good. Probably the one that will seem most unsettling and dangerous now is not the sexually edgy ones but \\"From the Government Printing Office\\" which warned of big, obtrusive government long before we had a big, obstrusive government. But the way the author does it, is brilliant.I enjoyed the Ellison introductions too. To me, they were one of the highpoints of the collection.A few of the stories are duds but most are high quality and, even today, interesting to read."},{"Title":"Remember, I Love You SIGNED","review":"I have had this book for probably almost ten years.

Each time I read this book I walk away with something new to apply to my life and there are parts I repeat to myself occasionally. No other book has even touched me this way."},{"Title":"Remember, I Love You SIGNED","review":"I wanted to know more about Charlie and Martha Shedd, and this gave very good insight to them and their final years together."},{"Title":"The Empress of the Last Days","review":"For her third novel of the historical trilogy (The Winter Queen, The Shadow King), about the clandestine 17th century marriage of Elizabeth of Bohemia and Pelagius Van Overmeer, a black slave of royal African lineage, the author attempts a different construct. Rather than follow the theme of her first two novels, the setting for The Empress of Last Days is the modern world of education, where researchers combine resources to uncover the true story of the secret royal marriage and its direct connection to the throne of the British monarchy.Tracking obscure religious and botanical tracts, as well as a play, the road leads to a mysterious young scientist in Barbados, Melpomene Paleologue. While Michael Foxwist, an Oxford don, is editing a play that suggests the original union of royalty to slave, a Dutch graduate, Corinne, works through the internet, acutely aware of the impact of the marriage on current affairs of state in England. A dedicated student of the web, Corinne will be organizing the information for dissemination to the public, with the concurrent need for academic integrity. It is Corinne who will be responsible for the quality of the search engine, site map, index and links to other sites, a huge undertaking, possibly the making of her career.Yet it is Foxwist who steps into the future, traveling to Barbados to pursue the last known person of Pelagius' genealogy. When Michael meets the young woman who could be Queen of England, he finds more than an interesting lineage; Michael falls in love. Yet he is not oblivious to the task ahead, including the blooming relationship with a young woman who has her own plans for the future.In her cleverly crafted final part of the trilogy, Stevenson approaches history with an engaging mix of personalities and possibilities. The novel is a study in the intricacies of academia, literature viewed in the context of real life, adding another dimension to the work. Clearly, Stevenson is comfortable in an educational milieu, her characters struggling for professional survival and personal fulfillment. At times mired in the jargon of academia, this is a multi-layered, densely-plotted novel. Not suited to all literary tastes, this book will definitely appeal to those who appreciate the import of the past on the present in an intellectual world where feelings still demand to be acknowledged. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"The Empress of the Last Days","review":"While each of the books in Stevenson's trilogy can be read on its own, this last offers a richer experience if read in the context of the other two. The first volume, \\"The Winter Queen,\\" set in the 1600s, chronicles the relationship between the former Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia and Pelagius, an African prince kidnapped and sold into slavery, but free at the time he meets Elizabeth. They married secretly and had a son, Balthasar, whose life is the subject of the second book, \\"The Shadow King.\\"\\"The Empress of the Last Days\\" takes place in 2002. It involves a circle of European academics who come upon a trove of 17th century papers in Holland, including a theological journal by Pelagius and his catalog of West Indies plants and their uses. The rest of the papers include a never-before-seen play by the English writer Aphra Behn, and a miscellany of papers from a printer, Petrus Behn, who seemed to specialize in political satire and pornography for an English clientele.Corinne Hoyers, the Dutch Ph.D student who first reviews the papers, has no idea how these items came to be jumbled together, but readers of \\"The Shadow King\\" will know that Aphra Behn, wife of Petrus, stole Pelagius' books from Balthasar. Corinne turns over the Aphra Behn material to a young Oxford don, Michael Foxwist, who subsequently discovers Pelagius' marriage certificate and Balthasar's baptismal record hidden in the binding of one of Pelagius' books.Being English, he instantly sees the significance of this - Elizabeth Stuart's legitimate male heir should have inherited the throne of England - and the succession should never have been diverted to the Windsors, current holders of that chair. As Britain rather half-heartedly gears up to celebrate the present Elizabeth's Jubilee amidst the latest wave of scandals and tawdry gossip, Michael discovers a more legitimate heir - a young black female scientist in Barbados.Michael does not, incidentally, share any of this - from the discovery of the documents to his meeting with Melita Palaeologue, the rightful heir - with his Dutch colleagues on the project. When he does finally get around to telling them of his discovery, they are not in the least perturbed, which strikes one of the book's few wrong notes. Stevenson may be trying to make the point that the British royal dynasty is of interest only to Britons, but our own tabloids can attest the to the speciousness of that claim.Besides, Stevenson has been at pains to point out that academics are a cutthroat lot, in fierce competition for prestige, jobs, money and important finds. Documents challenging the succession of the major reigning European monarchs are good for all of the above. And a man who would keep such a secret from his colleagues would sound alarm bells of mistrust to an already paranoid confraternity.Melita, a plant biologist, also remains unimpressed with her claim to royalty. From her point of view, \\"this whole idea's almost like an insult. In terms of genetics you can't say one bloodline's important and none of the others count.\\" Though Michael agrees when she points out that 90 percent of her ancestors are African, he can't help but point out that Pelagius was an African prince and on the Palaeologue side - 17 generations back - she's a descendant of the last Emperor of Byzantium.A subplot - the obsession of Michael's dotty uncle - makes Melita the \\"Empress of the Last Days,\\" a prophesied messiah-like regent, too confusing to recount here, but showcasing the mystical, almost fairy-tale trappings people confer on descent - ignoring the thousands of superfluous or undesirable ancestors.Melita and Michael fall in love. Stevenson handles this with passionate delicacy; they are cautious people of different backgrounds, interests, attitudes, and ambitions. But Michael is going back to England and they don't have a lot of time. And Melita must decide whether her right to the throne is the moral imperative Michael thinks it is.Like the previous two novels, this one is deliberately paced. Stevenson is not shy about diverting the unfolding plot with a discussion of Oxford's duty to tradition and the modern student, or the relevance of royalty to history and society's present concerns, or various issues of race, privilege, tradition and academia.A page-turner in its leisurely way, this is a fine conclusion to an absorbing, very different trilogy of ideas, romance and history."},{"Title":"The Empress of the Last Days","review":"This book is a novel of ideas, but also reads like an academic mystery novel, somewhat akin to the \\"DaVinci Code\\" without the sinister elements. Reading it was a unique experience for me, because I had read Stevenson's first novel, \\"The Winter Queen\\"; this definitely lends an extra dimension. The academics unravel some of the story of that first novel, speculate about the rest, and also learn about the ultimate fate of its primary character and his descendants. While a novel of ideas, the main character, Michael Foxwist, is competently developed, and the writing is good. Perhaps because I am not British, I found the ending somewhat disappointing: the different views occasioned by the discovery of the \\"true\\" heir to the British throne just were not that interesting, the scene in which Michael and Natty view the painting was not very moving, and the whole novel becomes kind of pedestrian at the end, as Michael and his fiancee are destined to find career bliss. Still, \\"The Empress of the Last Days\\" is an intriguing, and informative, work. It is informative about academic politics in two different European cultures, resources for historical research, and Barbadian culture and tourism, among other things."},{"Title":"The Empress of the Last Days","review":"The first five pages of this book were an incomprehensible mishmash of garbled descriptions and pointless descriptions of some lame Christmas celebration. It went from that dreadful start into a very densely written & interesting book following the search by several historical academicians to track down the trail of Elizabeth of Bohemia, her shadow husband, and their son. One researcher tracks the family to Barbados and finds the \\"heiress\\" to the throne. Some of the discussions pertaining to modern beliefs and cultural stereotypes are hard to follow, but interesting. After a slow start, the novel picks up the pace and the reader becomes interested in next round of research and what it will reveal. Interesting overall. I might think differently if I had read the first two books in the trilogy before reading this one."},{"Title":"The Empress of the Last Days","review":"Those who enjoy reading certain things should be free to do so , of course, but it would be nice if the rest of us had some idea before we spent money and wasted time. I don't know how the rest of the book turns out, but some potential readers might like to know that this 'literary' sounding book, once you get past the first few pages, has graphic refences to hermaphrodites, lesbians and things of that nature, using some truly filthy language. If that's your taste, as I said, well fine, but I won't be finishing it and I am sure that there are others out there who would like to know this BEFORE they buy it."},{"Title":"Mary Mulari's Accessories with Style","review":"Truly a wonderful book.

We know what first wife Gracie added, what massive collaborator Paul De Kruif contributed. We know how badly Sinclair Lewis wanted to prove to critics that he was not just a \\"knocker\\" of flawed characters and a negative satirst of an America full of Babbitts. We know how the researching, planning and writing of ARROWSMITH created and consolidated a method of doing fiction that Sinclair Lewis used over and over again. A method hammered out with Paul De Kruif.We think of parallels between the collaborators' nine week research jaunt by ship through the Caribbean and Graham Greene's turning his travels in Liberia and Mexico into books. We wonder why only in ARROWSMITH Sinclair Lewis created one heroic figure -- again, we notice, in collaboration with a Paul De Kruif whom Lewis taught to write and who taught Lewis about science and scientific role models.We think of the huge impact of Lewis and ARROWSMITH on the contemporary world, not just in the USA. No potboiler novel could have drawn John Ford to direct the 1931 movie ARROWSMITH. Ronald Coleman played Martin Arrowsmith, Helen Hayes was Leora Tozer and Myrna Loy played Arrowsmith's temptress during the plague on the sultry West Indian isle.In the novel Dr Martin Arrowsmith oscillates between medical careerism and self-sacrificial idealistic devotion to a cause: pure research. There is little room for women in his life, especially if they try to shape the hero up into being a competent tennis player and snappy dresser. In the end, Martin Arrowsmith can become Martin Arrowsmith only in a simply living, tiny male celibate community in the woods of Vermont.

He defended a classmate, Clif Clawson, after he tossed a pancreas in the hat of a visiting dignitary to the college. He strayed from his wife by showing ardor toward the daughter of his boss. Yet, his personal faux pas were child's play to the career-limiting moves of his professional life.Sandy quit medical school in a move thought out as well as Michael Scott's resignation from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. When he established a small-town medical practice, Arrowsmith chewed out a local supplier of pharmaceuticals and was forced to purchase medical supplies from a less convenient location. As head of public medical institutions, Arrowsmith established dictates without considering their political ramifications - and then fought those ramifications even when it was inexpedient and sometimes, unnecessary.Martin Arrowsmith could have used a lesson from Benjamin Franklin, who worked hard but also publicized the fact that he did. Yet, Arrowsmith could never be like Franklin; in fact, Martin would have dismissed the Philadelphia statesman as a man of measured merriment.The character of Martin Arrowsmith is based, in part, on a French-Canadian microbiologist named Felix d'Herelle, and also, in part, on American microbiologist Paul de Kruif, who was not officially a co-author of the novel but contributed heavily to the ideas and characters involved. Yet Arrowsmith is more complex: he is a character who must choose his path in medicine. Martin is distracted from his calling as a scientist by being, at times, a physician, and a medical health official. He derisively refers to the 'men of measured merriment' yet also covets many of their trappings. Arrowsmith despises, at first, the scientist Terry Wickert, but also discovers that the scientist Wickert is the man that he wants to be.Max Gottlieb, who is somewhat of a mentor to Martin Arrowsmith, is based on two real-life characters from the medical world. One is the German-born American physiologist and biologist, Jacques Loeb, and another is Dr. Frederick G. Novy, synonymous with the Medical School at the University of Michigan. The McGurk Institute is modeled after the Rockefeller Institute, which is called The Rockefeller University today. These characters and places were influences to de Kruif, whose book, \`The Microbe Hunters,' is probably his most notable accomplishment. Unfortunately, Lewis and de Kruif had a falling out after Arrowsmith was published, with de Kruif believing he was a co-author of the book, while settling for a thank-you page and part of the novel's profits.No matter what your profession, Arrowsmith is a fine novel. His career-limiting moves are lessons to all professions, and his journey is something that all people have to consider in discovering their calling in life."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"This story rings true about someone living a life full of thought and desire to do good.

At that time I just kind of ploughed through it. However, this time in my old age I savoured Lewis' descriptions which were interesting and meaningful, without actually being visual. I could get into the skin of protagonist and identify with him. What I found a bit lacking is Leora's character description and development. I kept waiting for this throughout the book. She didn't really have a personality, a character except being passive and almost non-existant.The book as a whole however, was a great experience. It was wasted on me when I was young and read it for the first time - really just from snobbery. I'm now looking forward to reading Babbit, what I also purchased.

Because this novel was written in 1925, it gives us a good view of what was then the current study and practice of medicine. It will seem dated because the development of the tools to fight infectious diseases (vaccines and antibiotics) was in its infancy, and the lack of these tools took a large toll on human life. Sinclair Lewis wrote an amazing book, both because of the compelling story and great use of language. Indeed, Sinclair won a Pulitzer Prize for this book, which he declined. Adding to the greatness of the story was the material provided by Paul de Kruif, a microbiologist who it is said contributed around a quarter of the story. This added a lot of then-contemporary medical science. I first came across de Kruif in The Microbe Hunters, another fabulous book (see my previous review of this). I strongly recommend Arrowsmith for anyone interested in the history of science or anyone who just wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"In ARROWSMITH, Sinclair Lewis tells the story of idealistic Martin Arrowsmith, born poor, who rises through hard work, a passionate dedication to \\"the truth\\", and two advantageous marriages to become one of the world's leading medical scientists. Writing in 1961, Lewis's main biographer Mark Schorer said that ARROWSMITH remained the most widely read of Lewis's novels, and that in its day of 1925 it was \\"another instant success.... (it) stilled those carping voices that had complained that in MAIN STREET and BABBITT Lewis... lacked 'spiritual gifts'.\\" Stung by these criticisms, and determined to write a \\"heroic\\" novel that would silence his critics and give him a shot at the big prizes (his calculations were spot on, as ARROWSMITH did win him a Pulitzer), Lewis concocted a thrilling plot which includes elopement, angry parents, tempting young women, professional intrigue, a bubonic plague epidemic, and an oddly modern finale in which adequately heroic Martin quits his post at a major research institute and retreats to a startup in the backwoods of Vermont.The sentimental seriousness with which Lewis chronicles Martin's career and marriage to one of the most unrealistically ideal wives in literature marks a sad departure from the sardonic wit with which Lewis observed George Babbitt go about his daily American life. When Babbitt meets his wife after an absence during which he's been trying hard to stray from the confines of marriage, \\"he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent.\\" How amusing and deadly that picture of Myrna's patient endurance of Babbitt's dreaded ardor compared to Martin's reaction when he's separated by the epidemic from his long-suffering and thus insufferable (to me, not Martin) wife Leora and tempted by lovely Joyce: \\"Did he really want Leora here, with Joyce... in the house? (Dear Leora, who was the source of life! Was she now... missing him, lying awake for him?) Suddenly he was out of bed, kneeling, praying to Leora.\\" Dear Leora, sticking to her usual policy of self-sacrifice for Martin's sake, conveniently dies, allowing Martin to marry the lovely and very rich Joyce with a clear conscience.ARROWSMITH marks not just a transition in Lewis's work from satire to heroic seriousness but is also the point at which Lewis turns away from seeing marriage from the female as well as the male point of view, and fixes his sympathies firmly with the men. Lewis is sympathetic enough towards Martin's first wife Leora, but how could he be otherwise, since she obliterates herself when her presence isn't required by Martin or the plot. She has the trick of napping \\"inoffensively\\" while Martin works, and remaining \\"unannoyingly silent.\\" But once Leora has been finally obliterated by bubonic plague, the silences of wives in Lewis's novels will invariably be annoying and their napping, offensive. This more limited patriarchal perspective, plus its deadly seriousness and mawkish sentimentality, are good enough reasons for ARROWSMITH to be almost completely forgotten today. Yet there are still reasons for reading it, chief among them the way Lewis, writing in 1925, manages to reveal so much about contemporary American life. Our obsession with the tricks and toys of science while we at the same time venerate a simpler more \\"natural\\" way of life. Our belief that intelligence and sporadic bursts of overwork will more than compensate for periods of drug-soaked dissolution and mediocrity (as they did in Lewis's own case). The tensions and power struggles in a marriage where the wife has money of her own. The vilification of socialism and organized labor by the comfortably middle-class. Reading even the most mediocre of Lewis's novels (which might be ARROWSMITH) lets us see how much of what we think of as modern about modern life has been part of American culture for at least four generations."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"This novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (for whatever reason) which the author refused to accept (maybe he agreed with some of the reviews). The author later won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930. The novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state, going to a fictional university, etc. I may get jumped on by some people for saying so, but personally I found the story dull and tedious (a good cure for insomnia). It does not compare with other prize winning novels which I have read that were written during the same era (Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth,\\" Booth Tarkington's \\"The Magnificent Ambersons,\\" etc.). I suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. If you have an interest in the author, I would suggest trying one of his other novels."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"It is incredible that Arrowsmith was published in 1925, the same year as The Great Gatsby, and yet won the the Pulitzer Prize (refused by Lewis for rather specious reasons, the only time, I believe, that a Pulitzer has been refused)over Gatsby. This is a testament to how times and tastes change. Today, Gatsby is acknowledged as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, fictional English novel of the 20th century while Arrowsmith is ignored and for good reason.I had been a fan of Lewis, having read Main Street, Babbitt and Elmer Gantry years ago. Those were good reads and effective period pieces of American life in the 1920's. Since then, though, I have read so much more of Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and so many other fine authors that, coming back to Lewis, makes it so disheartening by comparison. Sinclair Lewis seems now to me to be so pedestrian and overly obvious in his writing, at least in this book.Arrowsmith is too long and boring. My major problem, however, is with the character. Martin Arrowsmith is not a heroic character, as depicted by so many others, but rather a narrow, obsessed scientist who forgets all his human values along the way. I realize that Lewis was depicting the clash between science and idealism, corruption within the medical establishment, the rapidly evolving state of science at the time, etc. but if his aim was to express the heroic pursuit of science (at any cost?) through Martin Arrowsmith he couldn't have chosen a worse vehicle as a character. It is the cost in human terms that bothers me.Martin Arrowsmith commences as a naive, rustic bumpkin in medical school. Thereafter, he fails in his medical practice, fails as a public health officer and as a pathologist until he is finally brought to a research institute where he can be secluded in a laboratory. It appears that only in a lab, where he doesn't have to relate to humans, is where Arrowsmith can succeed and he does at the expense of everything else. What is the cost? Well, he has a near tryst with a underage girl along the way, in the end he completely ignores his long-suffering first wife (Leora)in his pursuit of experiment. Later, in essence he allows Leora to die on the Caribbean island where they are battling bubonic plague through neglect because he is under the charms of another woman (Joyce)whom he marries later. But the real kicker is that he actually consents to witholding vaccine to certain natives, at the risk of their lives, to validate scientific experimentation!Arrowsmith's slavish devotion to his German mentor, Gottlieb, is also sickening. Gottlieb's cold, impersonal devotion to science only would have made him a great Nazi doctor years later.In the end, Lewis seems to try to redeem his main character as he tries to get back to nature and follow pure research. But, at what cost? Only his abandonment of his second wife Joyce and their young son.If I thought that Lewis was trying to show scientific pursuit, among his other themes, in all its good and ugly aspects, with Arrowsmith at the exemplar, I would feel differently. It is his sympathetic treatment, in my opinion, of Arrowsmith the character and use as the vehicle to caricature and satirize the rest in the plot that bothers me. Arrowsmith, the unfeeling, irresponsible, inhuman and very unheroic automaton is not the proper vehicle for this purpose. At least in my book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Sinclair Lewis defines Martin Arrowsmith as \`a young man who was in no degree a hero, who regarded himself as a seeker of truth, yet who stumbled and slid back all his life and bogged in every obvious morass.' He is \`a snuffing beagle', who in his lifespan covered in this book never was in control of his destiny.This book touches all kind of important themes:- Commercialism and the religion of a scientist: \`Knowledge is the greatest thing in the medical world, but it's no good whatever if you can't sell it.'- Commercialism and profession: \`Explain to a patient, also his stricken and anxious family, the hard work and thought you are giving to his case, and so make him feel that the good you have done to him, is even greater than the fee you plan to charge.'- Public v. private health system: \`to get rid of avoidable diseases and produce a healthy population is killing commercialization, making money. Therefore doctors must become public health officers.'- Psycho-analysts as guess-scientists.- General human problems: \`the cruelty of nature kicking human beings by every gay device of moonlight and white limbs into heaving babies.- Influence of the Church on the irrationality of the masses. Its battle against free-thinking.- Personal problems: alcoholism, marriage.None of these themes is properly developed.The scientific basis of this book is very poor: fighting the plague with bacteriophages.Into the bargain, there is virtually no plot: the human relations with friends, colleagues, professors or women are more or less accidental. Also, after a far too long itinerary, the story ends abruptly.This book is a big disappointment and can only be recommended to Sinclair Lewis fans."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"I read this book as part of my participation in the high school extracurricular event Academic Decathlon. From this book, I was supposed to learn about the medical profession, the scientific research profession, the lives of scientists and doctors and how they fared in a rural, Midwestern America populated by bible-thumpers, illiterates, country hicks, and indigent farmers. What I got was the biography of a workaholic.Martin Arrowsmith, the protagonist of this book, is devoted to basic medical research, and is willing to sacrifice much in life to do it. These include money, fame, time with his loving wife, and time to himself to do things like exercise, go on a vacation, go out for a good meal, etc... In short, Mr. Arrowsmith is a workaholic, pure and simple. Just because his work is medical research instead of say selling cars does not excuse his undying love of work. In reading this book I saw the reflection of many people I know; single or divorced workaholics. Yes their jobs are important and yes they love their jobs, but they, like Arrowsmith, lack balance in their life. Overall, I found the book quite boring, and do not believe it should have won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"I have to say that i do love to read a variety of books, but Sinclair Lewis' novel Arrowsmith was absolutely horrible, and discouraged me from reading any other novels by Lewis. The novel was dull and boring. There was no excitement or suspense. There wasn't even a interesting plot. The novel also had an extreme amount of unnecessary characters,and it was too long which made the novel even more ridiculous. From most novels, you learn some values or something, but I didn't learn anything from Arrowsmith, except that sometimes a nap can be more interesting than reading a book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"I'm surprised to see so many less than stellar reviews of this book, because I really enjoyed it. Those who like tales of the early discoveries in classical microbiology, told with excitement as in Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters, will find plenty to love in these albeit fictional chapters. While the story can really get you excited about science, it also shows that, no matter how well-intentioned and important one's work may be, there can be exorbitant costs associated with too much passion for it. Good lessons for anyone contemplating in a career in science, which can easily consume too much of one's life, in my opinion. Beyond this, I throroghly enjoyed the characters, humor and description of the places and times. This is a book that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Arrowsmith is a 1925 novel by Sinclair Lewis (with considerable contributions from Dr. Paul de Kruif); it won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize, but Lewis rejected the award because the thought it promoted pandering in writers. The book chronicles the life of Martin Arrowsmith, a young medical student who tries to make it both as a practicing doctor and as a research scientist.Arrowsmith is always readable but never particularly interesting. It is rather loosely plotted (although for Lewis it's rather tightly plotted). Martin Arrowsmith is a headstrong, bridge-burning, tantrum-throwing idealist, and Lewis generates most of the novel's tension and conflict by throwing the most obnoxious, contrary characters Lewis can think up at him, and letting nature take its course. Much has been made about Arrowsmith being a \\"heroic\\" character; this is obviously debatable based on how one defines \\"heroic\\". Lewis certainly makes him a hero of medical idealism; but at the same time Arrowsmith is never particularly sympathetic.The novel is one great commentary on the medical and scientific professions. In fact, any time Lewis shifts the narrative focus away from Arrowsmith to other characters (which seems to happen unnecessarily often), the reader gets nothing but commentary. How applicable are these comments today? Well, that's nearly impossible for anyone outside the medical field to say.Today, Arrowsmith is likely to have an extremely limited appeal: those interested in medicine should find it quite engaging, but few others will."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Sinclair Lewis's novels typically look at a facet of American life, circa 1920, via an &quot;biography&quot; of a fictional character. _Babbit_ examined the world of a boobish, hapless real-estate dealer. _Elmer Gantry_ showed us the lives of preachers and clergymen and charlatans._Arrowsmith_ is recognizably another entry in this series. It is partially set in the fictional midwestern state of Winnemac, and George Babbit makes a cameo appearance. This time around, we see the state of the medical profession, from the practice of a small-town doctor to high-end clinics and public health offices. But unlike George Babbit or the hilarious scoundrel Gantry, Martin Arrowsmith M.D. is someone with ideals. He's no saint; he occasionally neglects an understanding wife and &quot;blows&quot; many opportunities to advance his career by spending too much time in a lab, persuing basic research.But Martin eventually does succeed on his own terms, idealism intact, a rare victory for a Lewis character._Arrowsmith_ was definitely a slog compared to _Babbit_ or _Elmer Gantry_. There are plenty of satirical bits, but they are fewer and far between. Those interested in the nitty-gritty of medicine and scientific research before electronic gear, electron microscropes, and computers might forgive the relatively slow pace."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"As a current MD/PhD student, I was struck by how much the protagonist's experiences in medical education in the early 20th century mirrored mine in the beginning of the 21st century. In part, this underscores the large human component of medicine. Beneath the increasingly technological facade, the qualities of a good doctor and the struggles that medical education entails change little because human nature remains little changed throughout history. The book is well-written, if in sarcastic and satiric slang, that captures the inner conflicts of Dr. Arrowsmith. Although Lewis was known for satire, this book and at least its main character and his mentor Dr. Gottlieb are nuanced portrayals of archetypes. Lewis puts the characters in human circumstances such as when the reknowned scientist Gottlieb is rendered powerless next to a country doctor over the sickness of his wife because he has lost all his knowledge of clinical medicine. It is well-worth reading a fine piece of American literature and especially for anyone in medical school (especially when preparing for the Boards) who becomes too focused on their circumstance and what to add emotion and depth to the conviction that score of doctors before and after will trod the same path."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Arrowsmith is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and has an important place in American literature. A major twentieth century novel, it is essential for anyone interested in Lewis, and multiple differences from his other work make it worthwhile for others.The book has significant style and plot similarities to prior Lewis novels; for example, the small town/country doctor bit recalls Main Street, and the Zenith section recalls - and even briefly features the title character of - Babbitt. Lewis is known as a satirist, and those novels virtually epitomize the genre, but Arrowsmith is not satire. It has satirical elements and is sometimes humorous but is essentially a straight realist novel with a more or less straight-up hero. Thus, though Lewis' absolute realism mastery is as strong as ever, one might think Arrowsmith sounds pedestrian or dull. This is thankfully not so because the title hero was a new type - an exponent of scientific idealism. The novel initially seems to offer an interesting but inherently limited inside look at the early twentieth century medical profession and is indeed valuable here as far as it goes. We get a good idea of what things such as medical school, internships, country practice, public health, and urban practice were like. Medicine has of course changed much since Arrowsmith's 1925 publication, giving it notable historical value, but the depiction is still largely accurate, lending considerable insight into an important profession. Lewis' usual excellences are also on prominent display. We get a panoramic grand tour of post-World War I, pre-Great Depression America from mid-size and urban Midwestern towns to the rural West to Chicago, New York, and more. Anyone curious about the era will learn much about everything from speech to social etiquette to fashion. We even get a rare up-close glimpse of an exotic non-American setting; this section is noteworthy for its grim realism and tragedy, showing Lewis has more range than he usually gets credit for. Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.All told, this is a must for fans, but anyone curious about Lewis should know that this is not representative. Elmer Gantry, Main, and Babbitt are probably better introductions, and those who do not like Arrowsmith should try one of them. In the end, though, the novel is strong enough to stand on its own and is highly recommended for anyone interested in American literature.As for this edition, it has a fine Afterword by noted Lewis scholar Mark Schorer with background on Lewis, the novel, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; there is also a short bibliography. Several later editions are likely at least as good, but anyone who comes across this will get a quality version."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Lewis writes, in very basic prose, of a turn-of-the-century man and his love for science. We follow young Martin Arrowsmith through his schooling and then into the upper echelons of doctor's officies, hospitals and laboratories. He grapples with several women and gradually finds himself staring down the figurative barrel of an increasingly-ignorant and hypocritical society. Some things go well for Arrowsmith, some things don't, and it's all wrapped up with a climactic, surreal and satisfying conclusion. I'd say it's a Great American Novel if there ever was one, and certainly another testament to Lewis's mastery.And oddly enough, I found Arrowsmith's story to be every bit as compelling as the finest of the thriller and mystery genres. A cursory glance will more than likely yield skepticism, but give it a few pages and you'll more than likely be hooked. Despite its subject matter, the novel rarely demands familiarity with the world of science and medicine. Lewis's writing is simple, easy to follow along with, and never dry or rambling. Those who are tired of being force-fed Fitzgerald and Steinbeck and Salinger, but still want to sample some of the early 20th Century's greatest literature, should invest some time in Lewis's work. He's a criminally overlooked novelist who deserves a hell of a lot more attention than he gets these days."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Arrowsmith is the story of a young man who constantly tries to find himself and his place in the world.

Eventually, they become engaged and she proceeds to attempt to change Martin's habits and mannerisms to the man she would like him to be.As he continues medical school, he's sent to Zenith Hospital where he meets a young nursing student, Leora Tozer. They become attracted to each other and have more in common than Martin and Madeline. They also become engaged and not knowing what to do, he introduces both women to each other and tells them he's engaged to both. Madeline's condescending attitude toward Leora and her comments about Leora's coming from a country place like North Dakota sways Martin to Leora.We follow Martin as he finished Medical school and moves to Leora's home town to set up family practice. It is interesting to see small town life in the western part of the country in the early nineteen hundreds. They have their own ideas about consuming alcohol, gambling, pharmacical drugs and medicine in general. Martin tries to fit in with the preconceived ideas of the farming community but eventually moves to the city where he will have more freedom.Martin tries a number of areas in his medical practice but his love is research and he takes a position in that area. During WWI, he joins the military and later is active doing research and helping with an epidemic of bubonic plague.The novel is well written but perhaps goes off the subject to moralize a bit too much.

Sinclair Lewis is a master craftsman of cumulative narratives. It becomes a matter of collating details and making a composite.The protagonist in this novel is a bit different from Lewis' other lead characters. Whereas Babbitt was always a sell out and phony, and while Carol Kennicott succumbs to a parochial mindset at the end of Main Street (whether or not she admits it), Martin's retirement to a cabin with friend Terry Wicket is an indicator of something rare and refreshing in a Lewis novel: A leading light who doesn't sacrifice integrity for reknown. There are any number of interesting minor characters to keep it interesting. Leora Tozer, Martin's first wife, is a poignant dim wit, and the story of Max Gottlieb's (Martin's college idol) hard-luck-to-sell-out story is a perfect and diverting trial for Martin, a man dedicated to pure research without sponsorship from some results-and-profit obsessed pharmaceutical company.This book is amazing, as are all Lewis novels I've encountered, in its intelligent depiction of unintelligent or, in some cases, misguided characters. It is something of a departure to find Lewis treating a character as an honorable, not a money-grubbing, human. This deserved its Pulitzer.

Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.All told, this is a must for fans, but anyone curious about Lewis should know that this is not representative. Elmer Gantry, Main, and Babbitt are probably better introductions, and those who do not like Arrowsmith should try one of them. In the end, though, the novel is strong enough to stand on its own and is highly recommended for anyone interested in American literature."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Intellectually driven people are as F. Scott Fitzgerald would say: different. Eponymously named, this book follows the post-collegiate years of Arrowsmith to his early midlife, with great tales of unending frustration of not being the captain of his own ship.Often we love to watch the weak excel and do extraordinary things -Forrest Gumpbeing the most obvious. But, after such people achieve such great goals, we learn they are more than just \\"different\\" but really extraordinary.Being a medical student, one would think Arrowsmith is extraordinary. But, we learn, his struggles in and out of school are quite reflective of an ordinary person with ordinary abilities. Being thrust out of towns in South Dakota and Iowa, he seems to be a wrong fit for even grossly normal society.But, catlike coincidences abound and he ends up stopping the plague in the West Indies, and has experiments successfully deliver answers to medical mysteries which no man had previously resolved. His unending intellectual appetite never subsides, and from his perseverance he can assert acclaim and even fortune.But, his quest is not for anything more than the hunger to kill for more intellectual achievement. Noble is the man who seeks to help other man. Not the man who seeks to pad his own pocket with pharmaceuticals or patents or other money-constituted ventures which many people did or would do in his position. Arrowsmith is a rare man in American capitalistic society.Even after marrying a multi-millionaire (after being a widower to a plain Jane girl from the Dakotas), he wants to be left out of society's primrose elite and seeks retreat to forested Vermont, with outhouses and laboratories which cannot be interrupted. He is the personification of the great man theory: a philosophical theory that aims to explain history by the impact of \`great men', or heroes: highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence and wisdom or Machiavellianism, used power in a way that had a decisive historical impact.It has been many years since reading a Sinclair Lewis novel - in fact this is the first time I did so voluntarily.BabbittandMain Streetwere required reading in junior or senior high. And, whenever you are required to read something, it seems to be less satisfying.I was very impressed and pleasantly surprised that this author is as good as the teachers had apparently thought he was."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"As a biomedical researcher, I identify with Martin Arrowsmith so my review may be a bit biased. As a writer, Lewis is first-rate. Most of the novel (up until the climax; you'll know it when you get to it) is very tightly plotted and quite gripping. I first read it over 30 years ago and I re-read it yesterday; it speaks to me now as then and is one of my favorite novels containing one of my favorite lines: Professor Gottlieb's description of organic vs physical chemistry, which I agree with. Why Lewis refused to accept the Pulitzer for it astounds me to this day.

After reading the first section about Arrowsmith's great-grandmother and her determination to go west, I was hooked. The writing is crisp, the satire is sharp, and the characters are as alive as any on paper. Martin Arrowsmith has his weaknesses and waverings, but his resolute pursuit of his goals is inspiring; like his wife Leora, you're willing to follow him anywhere. This novel will be particularly interesting to those in the fields of science and medicine. But, to quote Martin, if you have ever wanted to be \\"anything but a machine for digestion and propagation and obedience,\\" you will find something in his character and adventures that will push you to live with greater purpose."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Great story of young idealism and enthusiasm in struggle with bigotry, backwardness.

One part of the book I exspecially liked was when Martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time! I love it!

Do read it and see the reflections Lewis carries to you."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Martin Arrowsmith is a semi-competent, ne'er-do-well whiner. I stopped rooting for him about a third of the way through the book. A \\"hero\\" can't shoot himself in the foot a dozen times and remain a hero. At least I've never seen anyone outside a Woody Allen movie pull it off.Martin isn't helped by Sinclair Lewis's habitual \\"telling,\\" rather than \\"showing,\\" and by his tin-ear for dialogue, which comes in two voices: Finishing School and School of Hard Knocks. Martin--one of the few college graduates in his medical school class--speaks in Hard-Knocks English, and a rather forced version at that. Compare the masterful dialogue of Twain's illiterate and semi-literate characters in Huck Finn, written forty years earlier. Compare also the clear, realistic dialogue of Lewis's contemporaries, Hemingway and Dos Passos.Finally, if the writing of Arrowsmith were a meal, Sinclair Lewis finished his dinner around the close of Chapter 35, when Martin returns from St. Hubert. After that, Lewis just played with his food.Arrowsmith is a much more ambitious work than The Great Gatsby, also published in 1925, or The Sun Also Rises, published a year later. But unlike Arrowsmith, these other novels still hold up well, as does Dos Passos's much-more-ambitious USA Trilogy. If Sinclair Lewis's star has fallen in the last fifty years, it's easy to see why, reading this book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"... the John Deere tractor of fiction, a paint-by-the-chapter-numbers novelist! Sinclair Lewis, America's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, did indeed write the same novel time after time. Babbitt the Man of Business, Gantry the Man of Religion, and Arrowsmith the Man of Science are identical triplets. Their life stories all begin as a child who feels exceptional in the drab materialist monotony of a provincial town, who thus foolishly overestimates his own abilities and his proximity to the center of Fate. They make their first escape toward a larger world, only to be hobbled by sexual vulnerability, by the \`natural enemy' of their ego-fulfillment, Woman. On they forge, nevertheless, through chapter after chapter of compromised achievements and mitigated failures, until it seems that the novel per se is merely a contraption for humbling the perennial American Young Man of Promise. No novelist has ever humilated his heroes as vindictively as Lewis, or portrayed every one of his characters with such grim contumely and condescension.But wait! Isn't that Young Man -- Gantry/Arrowsmith/Babbitt; Gantabbitsmith -- oddly familiar? Aren't all those vulgar small-minded philistines perfectly recognizable? Neighbors and kinfolk at some stage of your life? Isn't it lucky for my own self-esteem that Lewis never wrote a book called \\"Bruno\\", about the man of Music?Arrowsmith aspires to a kind of distinction, in science and medicine, that makes his struggles more estimable, and his eventual shortcomings more painful than those of Gantry, but the point of the novel is much the same: the mightiest tree can only grow in fertile soil, and the soil of American culture, as Lewis saw it in the 1920s, was sterile. One has to wonder whether Lewis's fervid denuciations of American pretensions weren't perhaps the qualities most admired in his writing by the judges of the Nobel committee.There are slashes of scalpel-sharp satire in Arrowsmith, though it's hardly a book that you'll roll on the floor laughing over. And it's remarkably pertinent, even after 80 years, to many of the debates over education today, especially at the university level. Every one of the little debacles that beset the life of Arrowsmith in the first decades of the 20th C is just as likely to beset the life of a bright, ambitious youth in America today. That's the weakness of Lewis as a novelist, that he is as episodic as a soap-opera, and almost as predictable. But his strength is that he relentlessly told Americans the truth about themselves, then and now.Unlike Gantry or Babbit, however, as Arrowsmith bumbles through his failures as a small town citizen-doctor and eventually reconnects with his 'counterpart', the immigrant Jewish bacteriologist Gottlieb, his fundamental integrity and decency always survives. Arrowsmith is not a tale of moral degeneration like Elmer Gantry. One can sincerely 'root' for Arrowsmith to come though with his 'self' intact. And then, the surprise: the last large episode of Arrowsmith is uncharacteristically gripping, a genuine adventure that I do not wish to spoil by disclosure, except to note that it takes place on a Caribbean island that sounds identical to Domenica, one of my own Blessed isles. But this is the part of the book that troubles me most; Lewis seems committed to a view of science and scientists as Promethean rebels, only true to themselves when they strive in uncompromising individualism to light some sacred fire. It's that 19th C \\"Hero\\", the exceptional man extolled by 'lofty thinkers' from Carlyle to Rand and beyond. The vision of science as a collaborative triumph of society and government - the vision I share - seems to have horrified Sinclair Lewis. The great scoffer at folly of American literature disappoints me here; he could measure the shallows but he couldn't sound the depths.Arrowsmith is a book that grows as you read it, but I wouldn't suggest this novel for a first approach to Sinclair Lewis. The iconoclastic Elmer Gantry, addressed to religious hypocrisy and opportunism, shoots its barbs of scorn at a bigger target, and tells an uglier truth. Arrowsmith is \\"a good read\\" but Elmer Gantry is salubrious bitter medicine.Did Sinclair Lewis deserve the vaunted Nobel Prize? Sentence by sentence, as a wordsmith, certainly not! But as a social commentator, as a portraitist of a culture with all its warts and pimples, certainly yes! And consider some of the other winners: Rudolf Eucken, Paul Heyse, Romain Rolland, Anatole France, Grazia Deledda, John Galsworthy, Pearl Buck, Frans Sillanp&auml;&auml;, Johannes Jensen, Mikhail Sholokov, Patrick White, William Golding, Claude Simon, Toni Morrison, Orhan Pamuk ...

The main themes of the book seem to be about the pursuit of money vs. the pursuit of science and about the character flaws of many research scientists and medical practitioners.What's good about the book is that the plot is pretty interesting. I kept wanting to know what would happen next and how it would all turn out. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't so great. I end up agreeing with another reviewer that after the part on St. Hubert's island (about 3/4 of the way through) the rest is pretty dull--at least in comparison.The main problem with the book is that the characters are one-dimensional, especially the female supporting characters. The main character, Martin, is too cold, heartless, and selfish to really get behind even though I don't think Lewis intended it. He marries two women during the course of the book. The first one, Leora, is a boring little dishrag. As for the second wife, I didn't see the point of introducing her so late in the book since she didn't really seem to motivate any purpose or action, other than Martin's continued heartlessness in leaving her and their son. However, since she was pretty much just a rich society type with no real personality or apparent goodness, I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy for her and the kid was like a non-entity so I didn't get too worked up about him either.

If, on the other hand, an author wanted to write a lasting novel of top quality, I believe that there is no other way than to develop one or several characters in as much depth as possible, to plumb their very souls (as they say in the classics !) Irving Stone-style fictionalized biographies are another way possible way to go-you can combine the two genres. What Sinclair Lewis created in ARROWSMITH is a piece of socialist realism that drags dreadfully, a book in which no character is open to us, a psychological void. The novel is more a sociology of the American medical profession in the first decades of the 20th century, a kind of uninspired expos&eacute; of medical colleges, country doctors, pharmaceutical firms, big city surgeons, and top-level research institutions---a social catalogue peopled with insipid characters that lack all the zany but convincing frenzy of Lewis' other books. We follow Martin Arrowsmith's career from small town to university to North Dakota hick town and on up. It's not an easy climb; it's not a Hollywood story, I'll grant you that. There is an exotic interlude on a plague-stricken West Indian island to liven up the far reaches of the novel, but nothing can really stir you much if you've hung on till then. The basic problem is, as I've already claimed, that the characters take second place to the process. Who can forget Babbitt or Elmer Gantry ? There are no such larger-than-life figures marching through ARROWSMITH. The protagonist's first wife is so thinly-drawn as to be almost invisible, like some cardboard cutout instead of a flesh and blood woman. She conveniently takes a back seat to her husband's career. The characters tend towards stereotype. A couple characters from other novels---George Babbitt and Chum Frick---have walk-on appearances, and there is a Prof. Schlemihl, (who, so satisfyingly, Lewis did not fail to mention, was quite a porker) but none of the main actors in ARROWSMITH will stick in your mind. Romantic interests are added from time to time, like salt to soup. I felt, as I read, that Lewis' real talent lay in caricature. When he wrote, tongue-in-cheek, about the \\"small town glories\\" of 1920s and \`30s America, and he let his imagination soar, he was unbeatable. When he reined himself in, trying to be \`serious' and \`natural', he lost touch with that special genius. Written in between four of his greatest novels---\\"Main Street\\" and \\"Babbitt\\" came before and \\"Elmer Gantry\\" and \\"Dodsworth\\" came after, I can only think that Lewis' imagination faltered when he wrote ARROWSMITH. It comes to an unsatisfying conclusion and is entirely forgettable."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"There's a lot of intelligent commentary in the reviews on this novel. My contribution: *Arrowsmith* is a great read."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Sinclair Lewis is the bookend to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Both were born in Minnesota. Fitzgerald went to Princeton, Lewis to Yale. Both wrote their best books in the 1920s. Both drank, had women trouble, and turned bitter.But Fitzgerald is everyone's favorite author --- even the high school kids who are clueless about metaphors swoon over \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" You need an appreciation of satire to love Lewis; nobody does, and he goes unread.It's understandable. What would you rather read --- a romantic tale about a poor boy's rise and violent death on the glittering shores of Long Island (Gatsby) or a withering take on narrow-minded life in the midwest (Main Street)? Who's more interesting --- a criminal who went to Oxford (Jay Gatsby) or a blowhard whose ambition is total conformity to soul-deadening values (George Babbitt)?And yet. If you ask who describes America better, the more necessary writer is Sinclair Lewis. Main Street and Babbitt made his name, and most readers stop there. They shouldn't --- my wife, who once attended a one-room schoolhouse in Minnesota --- recently read \\"Main Street,\\" and found it a very close description of life in our chic Manhattan neighborhood. Dodsworth --- later made into a toweringly great movie --- is as fine a love story as Fitzgerald ever dreamed up, and a lot more realistic one, at that. It Can't Happen Here is a powerful political drama with a subject that's not as far-fetched as you might think: how fascism comes to America.And then there's Arrowsmith, which has an actual hero. Set in the midwest, it doesn't lack for satire; as Lewis depicts it, happiness in a small town seems to havbe the shelf life of about a year. And for a writer who won the Pulitzer Prize (and refused it), Lewis can write some dreadful dialogue. But the heroism thing --- that's compelling, and if you can move sprightly through the first half of the book, you'll find yourself getting excited and turning pages quickly for the right reason.The hero is Martin Arrowsmith. We meet him in 1897, in the midwest town of Elk Mills (\\"a dowdy red-brick village, smelling of apples\\"), where he is the 14-year-old helper of the local doctor. Martin is prone to hero worship --- he sees magic in the old man's love of puttering in a lab. That ignites a dream in Martin, and so, seven years later, he's in medical school. There he falls under the spell of bacteriology professor Max Gottlieb: \\"tall, lean, aloof\\" --- and a Jew.Gottlieb's love of science is pure; in an environment where many students and faculty think only of money, he alone seems to have ideals. Martin blossoms. But he's still a rube. He falls for a snooty graduate student in English and proposes marriage; later, he meets Leora, a nursing student, and proposes to her as well. His inept solution: to bring them together over lunch. Leora loves him more. They marry.Leora's family is important --- in their tiny town of Wheatsylvania, North Dakota. But don't call them cultured: They lived in a house \\"that has a large phonograph but no books.\\" Money talks, though. They bankroll Martin's first practice, and he settles into the life of a country doctor.The novel is about the impossibility of \\"settling\\" --- as Martin climbs the medical ladder, he can't ignore research, his first love. He has a knack for it, and, to his delight, he's invited to join Gottlieb at a prestigious New York research institute. And now the novel kicks into high gear --- the plague has broken out in the Caribbean, and the vaccine that Arrowsmith has been working on might just be the cure.Let me not spoil the thrill of these pages by revealing too much. Let's just say: success always comes at a price. And success doesn't always bring people what they most want. \\"Arrowsmith\\" is a book about the forces that fight to dominate us. As Lewis has it, that fight never ends.\\"Arrowsmith\\" is smart about the world of research, and drug companies, and the modest ambitions of many men and women in white coats. It is also about the love of knowledge and the desire to heal; it gets the blood pumping. My brother --- one of our best AIDS researchers --- tells me that \\"Arrowsmith\\" is the book that made him decide to study medicine. Long before page 450, I could see why."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Author Sinclair Lewis had some exposure to the medical profession early in his life through his father, who was a country doctor. Yet, even with some personal exposure, it's amazing how much of the idealism and cynicism, evident in modern physician practice, Lewis portrays in his 1926 pulitizer prize winning book, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;. Martin Arrowsmith, M.D. is a fictional idealist who is a human being before all else, but trying to bring science to the practice of Medicine. Actually, the story seems almost autobiographical due to the personal intensity and human fraility of the complex main character. As a registered nurse, reading Arrowsmith brings flashbacks of the past, like the cliches &quot;deja vu all over again&quot;, or worse, &quot;the more things change, the more they stay the same&quot;. Medicine for financial- profit, patient care challenges, personality conflicts, political shenanigans, professional competition, and overutilization of medical technology are some of the common problems Arrowsmith faces as he pursues a career in medicine after barely struggling through the politics of medical school in the mythical town of Wheatsylvania, Midwest, USA, in the early 20th century. This is not another novel about how physicians affect people's lives, but a masterpiece about the nuances of the medical profession as mysterious and suspect,of physicians who are heros and villans. Most surprising are the humerous vignettes sprinkled throughout the plot like bits and pieces of old Jack Benny radio show skits. When Martin Arrowsmith must decide if he is to fulfill his promise to marry Madeline Fox or betray her for his soul mate Leora Tozer, the genious writer Lewis creates such humor in the ensuing restaurant scene, that should be frought with melodrama, but, instead, is absolutely delightful reading. Similar humor engulfs the life portrayed of Arrowsmith's employer, Pickerbaugh, and his fleet of daughters named after flowers, like the saucy Orchid. Arrowsmith is simply a joy to read, especially for people who have a flair for some classic literature without getting too deep into concentrated philosophic thought. Simply put, Arrowsmith today, were he to practice in modern medicine, would probably be no better or worse off than he was in 1908 through circa 1920, when the novel takes place. Arrowsmith is a classic American novel and an entertaining story."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"This book won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. Lewis also won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is the story of Martin Arrowsmith, a medical researcher who, while attending a mid-western medical school, is influenced by an aged bacteriologist. Arrowsmith marries a nurse, who will encourage his career in research, and tries his hand at private practice. However, he fails in that endeavor. After a number of positions he joins a research institute in New York where he discovers a new microorganism but is &quot;scooped.&quot; He travels to the West Indies to try his &quot;bacteriophage&quot; on an epidemic. After his wife and colleague die, he starts administering the serum indiscriminately, destroying the results of his experiment. He returns to New York and marries a rich widow. However, social life interferes with his research and his search for truth. He quits the Institute and establishes a lab in Vermont with Terry Wickett, an uncouth but conscientious chemist. The model for Terry Wickett was Dr. John Howard Northrup (1891-1987), who will later win the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Apparently, the model for Martin Arrowsmith was provided by the microbiologist and writer Paul de Kruif, whose book &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; became very popular. The novel also contrasts the idealism of the research scientist, who unfortunately looses touch with those that care for him, and the apparent avarice of the medical profession."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"I'm giving Arrowsmith five stars because I read it many years ago and, like most of Sinclair Lewis's work, it is great. My criticism is of the Kindle version. In the preface we are told that some of the text has been rewritten because of \\"anachronisms that might jar the modern ear,\\" or something like that. I immediately clicked off Arrowsmith; I'll find the hard copy. I'd like to ask whoever made this unwise decision: don't you think that someone who is taking the time to read a book written in 1925 might WANT to have their ears jarred? Are you also rewriting Dickens and Shakespeare? I want to read the words of one of the masters, not the words of someone who thinks that he or she knows how a legendary author would write in 2011."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"I first read Arrowsmith as assigned reading while I was studying American Literature as a high school junior. As a boy already preparing for a career in science, I was shocked to find scientists portrayed as vain, publicity-seeking hacks! At the time I imagined that such was the nature of science in the early twentieth century; surely things had changed in the post-sputnik world of the Cold War America in which I lived. Once I went on to graduate school, however, I found a world very much like that portrayed by Sinclair Lewis! I continue to work as a scientist and researcher and continue to be amazed by the accuracy of this book! Happily, Arrowsmith provides a source of idealism as well as cynicism. Any young person who is considering a career in science or engineering research should read this book to prepare him or her for that which lies ahead."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Once again, Sinclair Lewis engulfed me. This is the fourth of his works that I have read (Elmer Gantry, Main Street and Babbit being the others) and although I didn't like Arrowsmith quite as much as those three, I still couldn't put it down.Unlike so many novelists, Lewis' endings are impossible to predict. They're not necessarily happy, or tragic, they're open-ended, which often mirrors real life. For Martin Arrowsmith, he ends up, in a sense, free and able to devote the rest of his life to research without any distractions. At the same time, he's lost his first wife and deserted his second and their son.Like the main characters of Lewis' other books, Elmer Gantry, Carol Kennicot and George Babbit, Martin Arrowsmith is not clearly a protagonist or an antagonist. The reader sympathizes with his frustrations, especially in dealing with his first wife's knee-jerk family. At the same time, I found myself rather angry with Martin's attitude now and then. Many of the other major characters: Max Gottleib (Arrowsmith's mentor), Almus Pickerbrauh, and Terry Wickett (Arrowsmith's friend and partner) evoke the same mixed reactions. Once again, I think this is an example of Lewis' realism, for in real life, there are few &quot;pure&quot; heroes; and even the noblest soul is tainted at times.Read this book to understand the personal frustrations and conflicts that infect everyone's soul; read it for a contrasted depiction of American life in small towns, mid-sized cities and large metropolis' in the earlier 20th century.

When I first read it (a dozen or so times ago), I could not fathom how any writer could be so creative, so different, so perfect. Give it to your favorite teenager. You could change his or her life."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"A period piece of early twentieth century America, this book still remains a worthwhile read in spite of typed, flat, and cardboard caricatures of the players in the story. The sometimes didactic discussion of \`doing the right thing' is timeless and worth consideration by any generation of readers. The tension of what is right versus what is good in Arrowsmith's science and medical profession can be teased and tested beyond that parochial domain. Every reader's battle with that tension will find a thorough airing of important considerations for their own lives through Arrowsmith's saga."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"Martin Arrowsmith is a man with a mission, a scientific truth-seeker, an idealist who perpetually returns to his pure research interests despite the material influences and social pressures of the world around him.Lewis's biographical novel portrays Arrowsmith, accompanied by his sympathetic wife, Leora, in a roundabout career from medical student to small-town doctor to public health administrator to bacteriology researcher. From boyhood to middle age, Arrowsmith walks a lonesome road, placing verifiable scientific knowledge and sincere craftsmanship above money, publicity, political power and social status (this is Lewis's affront to American \\"commercialism\\"). Ultimately, Arrowsmith is heroic in his remarkable perseverance and quest for truth, although some might label him a cold-hearted escapist for deserting his wealthy second wife, young child and promising New York City career in favor of a rustic laboratory and rugged backwoods existence on a fellow rebel researcher's Vermont farm.Modern readers will find Arrowsmith's devotion to his early 20th century \\"science as truth\\" dogma somewhat tiring, narrow and dated. Yet, in a broader sense, what is most important is that Arrowsmith consistently remains true to his core personal belief (which in his case just so happens to be scientific truth). His unwavering self-honesty is what makes Arrowsmith an eternally heroic figure.However powerful its message, the novel unfortunately reads like a patchwork of stages in our hero's career, somewhat artificially connected with the support of unconvincing reappearances of Arrowsmith's medical school classmates later in their careers (e.g., the sudden reappearance of the crazed, doctor-turned-missionary Reverend Ira Hinkley on Arrowsmith's trip to fight the plague in the West Indies, where incidentally Leora tragically dies). I conjecture that in reaching beyond the familiarity of his family's medical practice and venturing into the more rarified realm of scientific research, Lewis has stretched--as a chronicler commonly does but, I would say, a novelist should not--too far outside his own life experiences. The result is that this classic novel falls short of becoming a more emotionally engaging literary work with a truly believable flow of realistic life events."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith (Collier reprint)","review":"The central conflict of this novel--commercialism versus scientific idealism--reveals a different sort of author than we see in Babbitt and Elmer Gantry. In these earlier novels, Lewis neglects to offer a clear alternative to the unspiritual, conformist materialism of George Babbitt and Elmer Gantry.(O.K., Seneca Doane and Frank Shallard do represent an antidote of sorts. But Doane gets little attention in Babbitt and, considering his condition at the end of Elmer Gantry, Shallard's &quot;philosophy&quot; seems as futile as Gantry's.)In Arrowsmith, readers finally get a clear sense of one sort of life--and one sort of culture--that Lewis would prefer, namely, one dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge rather than material gain or intellectual homogeneity. In his pursuit of truth, Martin Arrowsmith faces many obstacles. He must overcome the accepted belief that one's duty in life is to make other people comfortable with themselves, no matter how shallow or simple-minded they might be. He must overcome the natural human desires for love, fame, money, respect, etc. Lewis's recognition of such conflicts makes Martin Arrowsmith's life more believable. But, at the same time, Arrowsmith's imperviousness to the usual effects of these conflicts--pessimism, greater self-awareness, less self-confidence, to name a few--seems suspiciously optimistic.I doubt many readers will recognize Leora Tozer as a legitimate female character, some critics to the contrary. No doubt she represents an ideal from the perspective of many men: she lives ONLY to care for and to please Martin Arrowsmith. But does anyone know such a woman?"},{"Title":"The Story of Suzanne Aubert","review":"This is a very learned book on this wonderful French woman who came to New Zealand in the 19th Century.

In an afterward, editor Roger Zelazny gives a gracious tribute to newcomer Gary Wright: \\"He is a newcomer who I think will do many a goodly thing as time wears on. I eagerly await his first novel. I tip my hat to him on the eve of what I think will be a grand career\\" (191).The Wright story, \\"Mirror of Ice\\" (_Galaxy_), was a cleanly written story of man versus suicidal aliens on a giant bobsled run. It was Wright's third published story. His first two were well written tales that also blended science fiction and some kind of racing. After that... silence. I felt that this was a shame. Like Zelazny, I believed that Wright was a promising writer.There are three other runners-up: J.G. Ballard's \\"The Cloud-Sculptors of Coral D\\" (_Fantasy and Science Fiction_), Harlan Ellison's \\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\" (_Rogue_), and Anne McCaffrey's \\"Weyr Search\\" (_Analog_). The Ballard is a late Vermillion Sands story of the men who fly gliders to shape cloud portraits that weep over the corpses of their subjects. I used to think that Vermillion Sands was set on Mars, but Ballard wrote that the setting was intended to be a resort on Earth after its glory days have passed. The Ellison is his hard-hitting tale of the murderous slot machine. Ellison writes that she is based on a real person, and I have no reason to doubt him. The McCaffrey is the first of her Dragonrider stories. Runners-up of novella length are not usually included in Nebula collections. But this one was such a grand adventure 'twould have been a sin to have left it out. You remember: The one about the clever scullery maid who bonds with a dragon hatchling and makes her way to the Big Time.We are left with three winners. For best novella, we have Michael Moorcock's \\"Behold the Man\\" (_New Worlds_), about a time traveler who goes back to view the \\"historical Jesus\\" and ends up replacing him. The trouble is that he and his companions are all too human and all too neurotic. This is not a story to please orthodox Christians. But it does provoke thought.The best novelette award goes to Fritz Leiber's \\"Gonna Roll Them Bones\\" (_Dangerous Visions_), a futuristic tall tale set on an asteroid in which the reckless Joe risks it all in a battle of wits against the Big Gambler. It reminds me of some of the old Appalachian deal with the devil stories. It is absolutely terrific, one of Leiber's very best.The best short story award goes to Samuel R. Delany's \\"Aye, and Gomorrah\\" (_Dangerous Visions_), set in a strange future of teleportation machines and pickup trucks, nightclubs and slums. In this world, spacers carry on a precarious relationship with the despised frelks. Who are the spacers and who are the frelks? Read the story to find out.Zelazny expresses enthusiasm that Chip Delany is at last being recognized. He refers not simply to his short story award, but to his award for best novel of the year: _The Einstein Intersection_ (Ace).All in all, an excellent anthology."},{"Title":"Nebula Award Stories: 3","review":"--------------------------------------------------------------------The book opens with JG Ballard's \\"The Cloud-Sculptors of Coral D\\",a fine Vermilion Sands story: moody, atmospheric, gorgeouslywritten, if slight of content. There are better stories in Ballard'sVermilion Sands collection, which is well-worth seeking out --especially if you're new to Ballard, or to land-coral, sonic statues andthe eccentric habitues of Vermilion Sands, a future seaside resort inpicturesque decline.\\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\" is a solid Harlan Ellison \\"down & out inLas Vegas\\" tale: the protagonist drops his literal last dollar into a slot-machine and hits the jackpot -- three blue eyes across, intead of threecherries. Then he hits the jackpot again -- and again. Someone inthere likes him... A nicely-done urban fantasy, with a nasty twist.Then-new writer Gary Wright has faded so far from view that hedoesn't even rate an entry in the current Encyclopedia of ScienceFiction, but I think you'll like his \\"Mirror of Ice\\", a gripping story offuture toboggan-races on suicidally-steep courses. The namelessviewpoint racer is making 'one last run', and it's a dilly. Finestraight-ahead sports-adventure writing -- hasn't aged a bit. I wonderwhat became of Wright?Samuel R. Delaney won the short-story Nebula for \\"Aye, andGomorrah...\\" -- he also took home the novel award that year for TheEinstein Intersection. Delaney's spacers have had... unusual surgicaladaptations -- \\"loose, swinging meat\\" -- and troll for Earthboundfrelks -- space-groupies -- on their time off. \\"Gomorrah\\" hasresonances I missed back in the sixties, but it's a fine, memorablestory on any level.\\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" is my favorite Fritz Leiber: it's unbelievablygood, one of the best SF novelletes ever written -- more thandeserving of the 1967 Nebula it won. If you've been reading SF forawhile, you'll remember this one -- it's another gambling story,which develops into a deal with the devil. Joe Slattermill, Mr. Gutsthe cat, the Big Gambler, Lottie the dice girl, whose \\"long, skinnywhite-gloved arm... snaked out like an albino cobra\\" -- areunforgettable. What a story! The sfnal apotheosis of the American talltale. Michael Swanwick writes that \\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" is \\"astory so good it makes my teeth ache with jealousy.\\" If you'vesomehow missed \\"Bones\\", well -- here's your chance, and the rest ofthe book is gravy. I've read this story countless times, and it gets meevery time. And -- it has the best last line in the history of SF. See ifyou agree...I remember bouncing off Michael Moorcock's \\"Behold the Man\\"wayback when, and I read it this time mostly out of a sense of duty,Nebula-winner or no. Moorcock just doesn't write to my taste, mostof the time, anyway. The plot here is simple enough: time-travellerGlogauer is stranded in Judea, 29 AD. He's rescued by John the Baptistand the Essenes, and... well, let's say he develops a serious Messiah-complex.\\"Behold\\" is certainly well-written and researched, and has a sockofinish, but I just don't care about religion -- or Mr. Glogauer, or hisneurotic girlfriend. \\"Behold\\" is written in a self-consciously 'literary'style, which put me off, too. Anyway, editor Zelazny asks us to \\"read[Behold] very carefully, please\\" -- but life is short. Hell with it.But do give it a try -- tastes differ. Anyway, who do you trust -- me, orthe Nebula voters?I must confess to being underwhelmed with Anne McCaffery'sDragonriders of Pern series, but \\"Weyr Seach\\" is where it all began,and it is interesting to see the setup of the sfnal premises for theseries. Her fans will enjoy \\"Search\\" , but 'mild pleasure' is the best Ican say after rereading this one.Happy reading!Pete Tillman"},{"Title":"The Deep-Sky Observer's Year: A Guide to Observing Deep-Sky Objects Throughout the Year (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"This book is a nice overview of some deep-sky objects, but has a number of flaws. Overall, I would say you should consider it as supplemental material only, not a primary reference. This is unfortunate, as a more thorough job of handling this topic would be extremely useful.First, like most (if not all) books in this series, there is no index. This makes it difficult to try and cross-reference information on an object to other books or charts. I fail to understand why a book of this type would not have an index, as with modern word-processing software, they are easy to generate.Second, at the beginning of each month, there is no table of objects giving catalog number, common name, constellation names and coordinates, as I would have expected. There is only a list of catalog numbers. The finder charts are skimpy, also.Potential buyer's should be aware that almost half the book (first 108 pages out of 248)is introductory material on such topics as binoculars, telescopes, how to observe, etc. This material, while good (although all aperture sizes are metric, with no translation to inches), is not why I wanted the book.

Pope is the story of the deep, dark descent of Alberta Graham. Alberta is a security officer at a Federal nuclear plant in rural Cherokee, Tennessee. Because of a promotion, she is transferred to this rural and racist area of Tennessee. Alberta has two strikes against her, one she is black and two she is female.The story depicts the corruption, for monetary gain, by the employees at the nuclear plant, Alberta&#65533;s discovery of it, the cover up that ensues and the racist attitudes of the employees. In addition to the corruption, Alberta&#65533;s mental state into abyss is showcased. We read and watch as this woman attempts to fight the system within and lose her mind in the interim. Additionally, we are able to experience with Alberta a romantic encounter that she has against her better judgment. How does this encounter fit into the scheme of things at the nuclear plant? Who are these people, both black and white, that enter and disturb Alberta&#65533;s world? Why is Alberta marked as a revolutionary and troublemaker within the &#65533;good ole boy&#65533; network?It is quite evident, as Pope states in the synopsis, that this book is for both the casual reader and the scholar. The colored waiting room, on the grounds of the nuclear plant, is symbolic and through Alberta&#65533;s actions and her musings this room becomes her refuge. The use of several literary techniques is excellent providing for a thoughtful, sympathetic, yet disturbing read.Reviewed by Dawn R. Reevesof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Colored Waiting Room","review":"The term \\"Colored Waiting Room\\" brings to mind segregation and Jim Crow in the south when African Americans were subjected to separate facilities, most often inferior. That is the crux of Alberta Graham's dilemma as she agonizingly awaits her fate in the rural south's equivalent of corporate America, in the backwoods of Tennessee. The Cherokee Nuclear Plant is the setting for the racism, sexism and snubs Alberta endures time and time again.The incidents are slowly and methodically taking toll, her sanity coming into question, acquiring that all too familiar label of angry black woman. Is this in truth the diary of a mad, black woman or a strong black woman? Labels withstanding, career mishaps including uncovering a corrupt management, family relationships and a workplace affair all combine to drive this woman spiraling into a descent of destruction.Pope's story is a good one, though her style has a sort of noire, surreal effect. At times, this was troubling to read but also served to drive home the serious reality of the situation. This reviewer felt this book could reach a wider audience and compete with other writings by black writers who tackle psychological issues experienced by African Americans, had the author received better content editing. Nevertheless, perhaps she will be discovered by a traditional publisher that will give her work justice.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Colored Waiting Room","review":"Ms. Pope's book reminds us daily that racism is alive and well.I can relate to this book and I know quite a few people, men as well as women, who share my sentiments.

The imagery in wording kept this reader entertained throughout the book. I so wanted Alberta and her life long friend, Reggi, to connect in a romantic way.I am sure there have been those that have offered suggestions as to how they felt a particular passage or point should have gone or would have liked for it to have gone... This reader is no exception (a slight chuckle should be inserted here).

The character, Alberta Graham, examines the past eight years of her life as she waits for the hours to pass in a long forgotten room at Cherokee Nuclear Plant in rural east Tennessee. Following her as she relives the highs and lows of her life, the reader will cheer her on, cry, laugh, and begin to live the experiences as the story prompts judgment calls. The discovery of an ongoing taxpayer financial burden with government racketerring, as witnessed through the eyes of Alberta Graham, is both disturbing and frightening.Colored Waiting Room took me on an emotional journey and didn't want to let me go. The racisim and blatant disrespect Alberta suffered was enough to make anyone upset. I believe the Colored Waiting Room was a story that needed to be told so that we can wake up and see that although things have gotten better, we still have a long way to go. I gave Colored Waiting Room five stars because of the boldness and complexity of the story. I recommend this novel because it deals with real life issues, and not everything is wrapped up in a nice pretty bow at the end."},{"Title":"Colored Waiting Room","review":"This book reads like a non fiction account of life in rural Tennessee, in the life of a black female officer. It tells the story of Alberta, who dares to wear braids in uniform and stands up to the other officers to don't want a woman especially a black woman with her position there. Alberta endures bigotry,fear, disrespect and fights back respectively, but the waiting game continues. I say it reads like non fiction because a some point this has happened to some black female officer somewhere. The book was well written and a good read. I give the book *** 3 stars.Debra Owsley"},{"Title":"Colored Waiting Room","review":"I love this book. The author has a great ability to make you feel like you know the main characters...as if you grew up with them from childhood. Her ability to make the characters vivid and relatable is uncanny. At the end, the author addresses an issue that most Black people must face at some point in their lives. I wish she had delved into that more...maybe an additional chapter or two. I'm very interested in how she would have concluded that issue.This was a good effort for her first book. I'm sure her next book will have tighter...more cohesive chapters...and address fewer concepts or situations so that the reader can stay focused on a few situations with each character. But overall, this book was pretty good. I love it. It's a nice easy read."},{"Title":"Colored Waiting Room","review":"Patricia Pope's, COLORED WAITING ROOM, will keep you aroused with anticipation as she weaves you in and out of suspense, drama, intrigue, and romance.A story of a Black Woman's struggle in trying to maintain herstrength of character, purpose, dignity, respect, and sanitywhile being entangled in a web of deceit and injustice.Travel with her as she takes you on this perilous journey intothe...

I identified so readily with her, it seemed as though the author were telling my life story .I applaud Patricia Pope for putting pen to paper in the telling of struggle in an area that few have ever been able to put so aptly. Yet there are many who have and are struggling as Alberta Graham. Patricia Pope is an author who has dared to bare the souls of many facing these same on a daily basis.This book has given me hope..that some things can be overcome with a strong sense of being.This is a book that can be read over and over , with each reading bringing to light strength and a greater understanding of the world around us ....as Black Women.

This is definitely a thinker's novel. The novel has been painted in a way that holds you and makes you say, \\"It's got to get better\\". This novel is not a predictable on it does have some dips, turns, and twist in it. Patricia Pope does a fine job in showing how in a given situation, over a period of time, the mind and soul can be stripped of all hope. The story line flowed naturally and you would never be lost or confused. It was easy to follow and remember what was going on. The characters were clearly presented and you knew where everyone stood. Besides Alberta Graham, the novel shows how Chief Klein too has been spiritually broken down. Colored Waiting Room does an excellent job of showing us how a horrible situation tears everybody down and no one wins in the end. This is the classic case of, when the line is drawn what will you do! A job well done and it should leave you wondering,\\" What would I have done\\"."},{"Title":"Colored Waiting Room","review":"Colored Waiting Room captures the readers' attention from beginning to end. The main character, Alberta Graham takes us through the highs and lows of her personal journey, to which many women have gone through and and still going through in today's workplace.

I had to face the bare facts: I was losing money, plain and simple.\\"What had I done wrong?\\" I was asking myself. \\"Haven't I read just about all the trading books everyone is supposed to read? Haven't I tried just about every trading system imaginable? Don't I truly have the passion for trading? Haven't I had several fairly long and satisfying winning streaks?\\" The answer was definitely yes, yes, yes, and YES again to all these questions. So, how come I'm not making it? That was the REAL QUESTION.Then I heard about Vadym's new book, The Master Profit Plan. Intriguing title, I thought, so I bought a copy. And, to my pleasant surprise, after reading just the first few pages, NEW HOPE was already springing up in my heart. Here is finally a book that is NOT about how to implement somebody else's system, but rather a book about how to design and implement your own system! My own system! What a novel idea! The more I read, the more excited I became. I began to realize that the missing ingredient needed for my own success was to GET TO KNOW MY OWN SELF! What are my talents? My limitations? How much time do I have for trading? How much do I need to make on a daily basis? How much can I afford to risk per trade? Am I scalper by nature, or is swing trading better for me? Or maybe it's a combination of the two? Do I like breakout plays, or am I more comfortable with reversals? What data do I really need to track in my daily journal?The author helps you answer all these questions, and many more, through the ingenious use of flowcharts (Mind Maps) that will help you quickly and easily map your own plan. There is much more to the book, with topics ranging from trading psychology to basic technical and fundamental analysis. And as a bonus, there are several real life success stories from other traders who have \\"found themselves\\" and are trading their own unique plan.AND FINALLY, as for me, I've been trading successfully for several months now, and with a plan that is unique to me. Vadym Graifer's The Master Profit Plan has truly been this trader's salvation. Thank you for writing this book, Vadym."},{"Title":"The Master Profit Plan: Your 5-Step Trading Plan Workbook","review":"I wish that this had been the first or second book I read about daytrading for a living. It would have saved me alot of money.Daytrading, at least for me, is tape reading, plain and simple. The book stresses that. Erase the outside noise and watch the tape. If your right, great, if not get out fast (no hard feelings, it's not personal).Also, as discussed throughout the book, I finally forced myself to set up a written trading plan. I read it every morning prior to trading. It has helped re-inforce my discipline.Very good book for daytraders. Especially liked the stories from actual traders. Seems many of us go through the same problems."},{"Title":"The Master Profit Plan: Your 5-Step Trading Plan Workbook","review":"Think of this book as a 101 introductory course in college. It's the basics pulled together in one place. The author introduces the reader to all the necessary facets of trading from the psychological to the tactical and administrative aspects, as well as a bibliography of significant trading texts all traders should read, if not have in their library.Instead of wading through the myriad websites and books out there, start here. It ain't practice makes perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.This book will keep the aspiring trader from developing some bad habits that can later be hard, as well as EXPEN$IVE to break, and help the struggling trader clean up his methods and approach. It will guide you through \\"first things first\\", and how to prioritize and define the steps in your development. It gives you a roadmap to get from point A to point B, so you don't have to figure out the map for yourself.This book is not for the advanced trader looking to broaden his toolkit, unless he/she is looking for a good basic review manual, which frankly, is a good idea to have."},{"Title":"The Master Profit Plan: Your 5-Step Trading Plan Workbook","review":"This book is a great resource and really opened my eyes to many aspects of trading that I've overlooked in the past.

It is often difficult to find reading material covering fire suppression that is niether out dated nor too focused to provide any real benefit to the reader. As a student, I have used Brady's &quot;Fire Suppression Practices and Procedures&quot; in two lower division Fire Technology classes.Author, Eugene Mahoney, brilliantly covers all areas of fire suppresion in a logical sequence. The book opens discussing &quot;Fire Chemistry and Behavior.&quot; This first chapter briefly reviews the fire triangle, stages of fire, and fire phenomena (backdrafts, flashovers, and rollovers). The second chapter focuses on the responsibility of size up. Chapters three through five breaks up operations on the Engine, Truck, and Salvage companies. Chapter 6 covers &quot;Basic Firefighting Tactics,&quot; including locating the fire, confining the fire, and extinguishing the fire. Fire command and the ICS system are covered in detail in Chapter 7. Mahoney concludes by covering in detail, suppression of fires in buildings, mobile equipment, and miscellaneous fires.I would recommend this book be part of every firefighters library. A great reference book, especially useful for promotional testing."},{"Title":"All the Poems of Muriel Spark","review":"Really enjoyed All the Poems of Muriel Spark. Her work is intelligent, witty and not at all concerned with what reviewers on either side of the Atlantic might think. And evidently, Ms. Spark felt that way for over sixty years. Compared to the gobbledygook verse being shoveled our way by legions trained poets, these poems, which come from all periods of Ms. Spark's writing career, truly delight, perturp, shock, amuse, and provoke thought--provoke one to think. I believe I felt something, too.I checked 22 of these poems as outstanding in the table of contents (one check beside the title) and five of them as beyond-outstanding (two checks beside the title). Those beyond-outstanding I believe are \\"While Flickering Over the Pages\\" ( a kind of lament for a \\"wasp-like\\" reviewer), \\"That Lonely Shoe Lying on the Road\\" (a personal favorite for a personal reason), \\"Conversation Piece\\" (an insight into how talking about something sometimes obscures that something), \\"Bluebell Among the Sables\\" (pushes through to transcendence) and \\"Three Kings\\" (clear in its metaphor and timeless in its message).This book was a real find, for me, full of well crafted work in both formal and free mode. All the Poems of Muriel Spark should be read as a lifetime of stand-alone poems, since the poems were written over a very long period of time. Don't look for a developed, single theme the poet is striving to present, but the keen eye and verbal prowess of a genuine poet."},{"Title":"All the Poems of Muriel Spark","review":"One of the greatest and most underrated novelists and short-story writers of the 20th century (Memento Mori, 1959; The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, 1961; The Girls of Slender Means, 1963; The Driver's Seat, 1970; The Takeover, 1976; Loitering With Intent, 1981), Muriel Spark is a visionary and a true original. Despite the genuine and much - commented upon poetic approach she takes when writing fiction, poetry writing itself is not among her authentic talents, as All The Poems Of Muriel Spark (2004) aptly displays.Readers will be uncomfortably reminded of Spark's onetime T.S. Eliot fixation in many of the early poems, while others attempt and fail to carry off Stevie Smith's idiosyncratic brand of British humor. Only a half dozen are even mildly successful, and these barely worth reading more than once.The poems are littered throughout the book haphazardly rather than chronologically, but the earlier, better poems are easy to spot even without referring to the contents page. In most cases, Spark's later poetry consists of little more than plays on words and self - conscious, eccentric scribbles that anyone with a free hour and a pencil might produce.Adding as it does nothing to Spark's literary reputation, this volume would have been better left uncollected."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"This is the collection of essays through which I was introduced to Stanley Hauerwas. I wish I had begun reading him sooner. Hauerwas' arguments are clear and to the point, and some of his comments are jarring; but then, we need to be shaken from our complacency. I like that fact that Hauerwas can combine what is sometimes an abrasive manner with humility. He truly seems concerned not only with whether we think through these problems, but also with whether we properly understand what the problems are that confront us as Christians. I recommend this book to anyone who is concerned with ethics and especially the manner in which Christians should respond to the issues of the day."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"Hauerwas has a reputation as a sort of theological curmudgeon, but in reality he is as clear a thinker as we could hope for in an ethically confused time. And he reveals himself as deeply human at the same time. This survey of his work helps me think my way through many theological briar patches - whether I agree with Hauerwas or not.Readers who like the way Hauerwas combines breadth, depth, and compassion with a stringent ethical vision will also want to read Heroism &amp; the Christian Life by Brian Hook and Russ Reno."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"If you want to understand Hauerwas' thought on the issues of the day, as well as his method for doing ethics, begin here. The selection of essays for this text allows you to see many facets of Hauerwas' writing. The opening essays attempt to show how Hauerwas goes about doing ethics. They explore the way narratives impact the living of life and what Christian discipleship looks like. The later essays explore particular social issues, such as war, capitalism, sex, and medicine. The introductions and conclusion by other authors help to understand some of Hauerwas' thought. The essays in this book range from complex to simple and straightforward. There is something here for everyone, though some of the essays might be a struggle for those who are unaquainted with Theology and Ethics. Be prepared to disagree with some of the things Hauerwas says. However, if you want a thought-provoking book that deals with the issues of the day, this is it."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"Stanley Hauerwas is probably the most influential contemorary Christian ethicist. While prolific, Hauerwas can be frustratingly difficult to read, especially if one's goal is to get a sense for his overall &quot;system.&quot; (He avoids this last word like the plague.) This anthology provides an excellent way to learn Hauerwas's approach to contemporary Christian ethics and his views on a range of topics."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"This volume gathers in one place important occasional works of one of America's foremost theological ethicists. A 'must own' for anyone working in Christian ethics. It is also a useful resource for anyone interested in pacifism, medical ethics, communitarianism, and Christian theology."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"If you think you know what it means to be Christian, read Hauerwas. If you have questions about what it means to be Christian, or how to be Christian, read Hauerwas.Written by a protestant, enjoyed and studied by Catholics, protestants, and others.You may end up with more questions, but that struggle is part of the answer. True Christians will be grateful for a clearer understanding and for the challenges Hauerwas presents. It is a struggle worthy of engagement. Read more Hauerwas, live a better life.Open your mind and be prepared for a deeper understanding, no matter where you are in your journey.This is a well organized collection of writings, but no need to read it in any order. Do not fear loss of continuity if you put it down for months. Keep it handy and pick it up again when you have a few moments."},{"Title":"The Hauerwas Reader","review":"I have not read any of Hauerwas' works in their entirety. But this is an intriguing set of essays. Stanley Hauerwas approaches many issues from a totally different perspective than the world around him. Unlike many western Christians Hauerwas does not look at social issues in term of rights; for example abortion. Hauerwas does not qualify his remarks on abortion in terms of right to life, right to one's body, etc. instead Hauerwas' view of life is that it is a gift of God that we should not address as a right because rights are ostensibly legal entitlements. This does seem to be a Biblical perspective on the issue, at least it is in my opinion. That not withstanding Hauerwas makes little use of scripture in these essays. Something I find rather disturbing. As a Christian I want to see ethics spelled out in scripture because that's the bread and butter of my faith. This is the only major shortcoming I can readily identify in the way he addresses things. Overall I would recommend this work to any Christian would wishes to reflect on social issues in a way that does not require them to play ball with the world at large."},{"Title":"Biographia Literaria (2 volumes)","review":"Coleridge is a writer/thinker whose own life and works, particularly the later ones, seem to defy the eye of future standard, especially in an age of slick convenience. He is looking for &quot;the vast,&quot; does not ignore German idealism like so many other Brits, nor philology, and seeks the vast from the socio-political context of a well-booked, if ne'er-do-too-well, remote, clergy-trained, English townsman. Some chapters are almost unbearably (to our age) slow, but don't forget this was the era of the triple decker, and Coleridge's reading (as was his library) was varied and vast. In all it may serve best the reader who keeps STC's religious and political anachronisms in context without relinquishing their flavor. Although this is another one of those disappearing (if at times arcane) gems by dead, white, European males whom we are obliged to ignore these days, yet Coleridge's romanticism, honest pessimism, and philosophical searching will never be passe for the thoughtful. And inasmuch as this title includes some of his lesser known mature work, the rich surpise implicit in that description will happen, recurrently and rewardingly, on the thoughtful reader."},{"Title":"Gold Panning in New Mexico","review":"The book covers Gold Panning in New Mexico adequately and defines the locations at which to do it."},{"Title":"Gold Panning in New Mexico","review":"This book/pamplet is not completely worthless, but close, and very much over priced. The book has some locations that may or may not exist now, nothing you can't find out by contacting NMBLM or the area you want to go to.I saw this book offered for as much as $98.00, decided on the $28.00 price, and when it arrived found that it had a $9.95 faded tag inside the cover.

It would have been very easy for this book to go over that edge but it keeps it's focus and stays well within the realm of practical advice to enhance your home theater.The sections on how to enhance your projection TV is excellent and very practical. There is good coverage of speaker calibration, system maintenance, and TiVo. There is also good material on acoustic tremblers which will bring the experience really close to home.A must buy book for home theater enthusiasts.

I recommend the book, but I was disappointed with several aspects. 1) It seemed to be aimed more to the high-end user; no information about home-theater-in-a-box or virtual surround sound was given. I can imagine the author's opinions on these subjects, but he should have at least addressed them. 2) Some information is rapidly becoming outdated, especially in the video processing and connectivity sections. This book should probably be updated once a year. 3) Too much unnecessary detail in some areas. For example, a large section on antenna construction should be shortened, since most people probably use either cable or satellite anyway. And while the long section on user service codes is good, most of it will be out of date by the time the book is published. 4) Too much emphasis on projection displays, and not enough detail on flat panels (e.g., mounting issues, care/maintenance issues). 5) I would like to see more information about wiring strategies: different ways to hide wiring, the status of wireless speakers, etc."},{"Title":"Home Theater Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"Home Theater Hacks is the perfect book for anyone in the planning, building, or improvement phase of their home theater. This book really covers everything that has to do with a home theater: from selecting the right components, to component configuration, to cabling, to making your theater look awesome. This book is a must read before you start your home theater.The book begins with a very thorough and impressive discussion of how and where to buy home theater components. The author discusses receivers (both audio and video), DVD players, TVs (both HD and standard), as well as the ins and outs of buying online versus at a local store. This discussion naturally leads to a very large section on \\"configuration\\", which includes such things as how to install and configure a terrestrial television antenna, how to match your subwoofer to your room, and everything you ever wanted to know about cables. I particularly enjoyed the author's discussion of the modern myth of expensive cabling. He provides a very good explanation of what \\"good enough\\" means (you wouldn't put gold water pipes in your home, why spend $100 on a gold cable?).As mentioned, this is a very interesting and useful book for anyone planning or currently working on a home theater. It dispelled a lot of myths I had heard in the past, and provides clear explanations as to why many of these myths are false. Additionally, I found that the book provided sound advice in the purchase and configuration of home theater components."},{"Title":"Home Theater Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"I am by no means a home theater nut, but I figured I could always use a few pointers on setting up my living room to improve my viewing experience. The nice thing about this book (and all \\"hacks\\" books, for that matter) is the broad spectrum of ideas and suggestions. As a lot of this stuff was new to me, I appreciated the amount of detail the author goes into for each hack.I found the hacks on Calibration (#60 - #74) the most helpful for getting noticable improvements quickly. There are also plenty of other simple tips here and there (i.e. lighting, wiring, warm-up vs burn-in) to enhance my home theater. However, the book was a bit over my head at times -- therefore very educational.

Those more experienced A/V hobbyists will relish in this comprehensive industrial-strength expose of information that ranges from the practical to the sublime. Like many other technical subjects, this book let's you take your home theatre system as far as you pocketbook is deep, but does offer practical advice as to how to get the best bang for your buck. But be prepared to understand a lot of technical mumbo-gumbo that the mainstream installer would probably fair better using the services of a pro.

Certain advances in technical quality that the book warns of (e.g., burn-in on plasmas) have been on the large part addressed by the manufacturers in the three years since this book was published. It's a good text for those prepared to do their homework. Considering the cost of the book versus what you could spend finding this stuff out the hard way, it's a very small investment (&lt;0.1-1%).

One of (or the) most challanging tasks for a new A/V system owner - (or an owner with major additions or changes to make), is the nightmare of \\"quantum CABLING\\"!'Cabling' implys the input-and-output of *signal*-carrying cables, (in back of every multi-component A/V system).Scores of \\"Outputs\\" from unit 'A,B & C' to \\"Inputs\\" on units 'D,E & F' were bad enough... on we have *INputs* &lt;and> *OUTputs* to deal with on 'D,E & F'!First came Video Cassette RECORDERS, VCR's - then, DVD Players & RECORDERS and now Hi-Def players & RECORDERS. The information in most publications on the subject of A/V systems tends to be 'dated', which on some subjects is to be expected. But, \\"CABLING\\" should not be one of them.As new products & technoligies arrive there is sure to be new info to be \\"added\\" to the \\"Cabling\\" discussion. But, input-output fundamentals of 'cabling' change very little if at all. One of the 'little' changes that began way-back with VCR players-&-\\"RECORDers\\" was the need for both sound+video OUTputs from the TV/A/V Receiver - plus audio+video siginal 'cables' back, (from the VCRecorder), to>> the TV/A/V Receiver! And then, DVD players+'RECORDERS' were \\"added\\"... OH MY!It is true that some brand names & models (of various A/V products) do have built-in (signal path) restrictions or limitations (which are far to frenzied to cover here). SHAME on the products Manufacturer Standards Association for not requiring a planely visible label on every product box, (and in manuals), listing any-&-every Play-Record 'signal path' or 'format' limitation built into their product or circuitry.All the above combined has lead to a preverbal \\"train wreak\\" in \\"cabling\\" confusion. Few, very few, \\"all about A/V\\" books offer any new information or 'latest solutions' to help with the explosion of new 'stuff' to interface into our A/V systems. Worse yet. The book(s) introductions seldom mention whether the subject of \\"cabling\\" is even discussed. Lame cabling can lead to a myriad of unintended problems, even system damage. 'Cabling' has expanded into a 'hydra' that calls for a well illustrated chapter, all to itself, in any book worth buying."},{"Title":"Home Theater Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"This book covers it all.

Without the voluntary aid of Choctaw soldiers, first against the pro-British Creeks and then against the British themselves at the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson would never have emerged as a national hero. Jackson's cold-hearted betrayal of the Choctaw seems to me to define his character - greedy, opportunistic, obsessed with personal honor, inflexible.But, as Arthur DeRosier makes clear, the removal of the Choctaw and other Christianized, \\"civilized\\" tribes of the American south-east to the trans-Mississippi wilderness, during Jackson's regime, had been foreseen and planned by previous federal and state administrations, most articulately by Thomas (all men are created equal) Jefferson. DeRosier was a scholarly pioneer in re-evaluating Jefferson's Indian policies, and his indictment stands proven by later studies.Like their eastern neighbors, the Cherokee, the Choctaw were agriculturally settled people, living more or less as their English-speaking neighbors did, at the time of their forced removal to the swampy lands now called Oklahoma, which were far from uninhabited by less \\"Europeanized\\" hunter-gatherers. But greed for plantation-suitable land and racial contempt for the Indians pushed inexorably toward two forms of expropriation: violence at the settler level and/or federally managed \\"removal\\" to the trans-Mississippi. During the presidency of James Monroe, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun committed the government to the latter, constructing a \\"moderate\\" scheme of compensated removal essentially the model for what was culminated less than two decades later under Jackson. However sincere or generous the compensation would be - and it was neither - the whole scheme was forthright ethnic cleansing long before the term was coined.The Cherokee's suffering on the \\"Trail of Tears\\" was greater and more dramatic than the misery and disruption experienced by the Choctaw, and has received more historical attention. But the Choctaw removal is well documented in broken treaties, government documents, and personal accounts. These are the materials that DeRosier employs to build his case against the state and federal architects of this massive injustice.Once relocated in Oklahoma, the Choctaw proved themselves more capable as \\"pioneers\\" than most European-Americans, using their agricultural experience to farm virgin soil and building a solid village culture with exceptional emphases on education and Christian piety. Ironically, their greatest difficulties arose from the hostility of less civilized tribes that they had unwillingly displaced. For better or worse, the so-called Indian Territory remained a \\"going concern\\" ... until the next land grab, when the lands were declared open to all."},{"Title":"The Removal of the Choctaw Indians","review":"As a Choctaw indian, I am always looking for books that give me history of my forefathers.

Crippled by disease, the child ponders the small beauties of life that offset her plight.

This memoir was written from the memories of a little girl now grown. Her young life seems nothing but gloomy, and yet she never forsakes her sliver of hope.Little Marianna learned all she could from her peers and other patients at the hospital where she was bound. She was very perceptive and eager. She learned about many other beliefs regarding life and the afterlife, and she (as the author) sums up what she believes to be the truth.The only drag in reading the book is that the author's thoughts sometimes jump around as she remembers more things that are important to her. Many of the details may not seem important to the reader, but are interesting nevertheless.Reading this book was heartening. The author takes the reader on a journey through her heart and mind.

After finding out what has happened she is ready to go.She soon discovers that this is a true archaeology find, and calls to have a team started on digging carefully through the dirt. The only drawback to having her superiors choose a team is the fact that they send her worst enemy, her Ex-husband Jacob Graystone.

Half of the town thought it was great that they were building some new homes in the area - the building brought jobs and the new families would breathe new life into the little town. The other half of the town wanted to preserve the beautiful area which sat by a tranquil pond as a nature conservation area. However, nature lost out to commercialism and the Antietam Creek development was underway when a construction worker found a human skull while he was digging.When archaeologist Callie Dunbrook discovered that the skull was 5,000 years old, she jumped at the chance to go and excavate. This could be the find of the century and make her career. Not even the discovery that Jake Greystone, her ex-husband, would be the anthropologist on site could keep her away. Callie throws herself into her work, but quickly has her world pulled out from under her. Suzanne Cullen, owner and founder of Suzanne's Kitchen, a successful bakery business, spots Callie on TV and knows that Callie is her long lost Jessica, her baby who was stolen when she was only a few months old.Callie refuses to believe it. Her parents never said anything about adoption and she thinks that Suzanne is not very mentally stable to boot. Unfortunately, Callie soon learns that she was adopted and that her parents paid a quarter of a million dollars for the privilege. Callie knows that she cannot be the daughter that Suzanne has always waited for, but she is determined to bring those responsible to justice. But as Callie uncovers dark secrets she discovers that someone is determined to keep the past buried - even if they have to kill for it...I think that this is one of Nora Roberts best romantic thrillers. Her characters are absolutely riveting in this book and I identified with and loved them all. Callie, who loved her parents and thought that being independent was the only way to be free; Jake, who thought that expressions of love didn't have to be verbal and that if there was no trust there was no love; Suzanne, a woman who had sacrificed everything including her husband and her other child to find the child that she had lost; Lana Campbell, Callie's beautiful, capable lawyer who had lost her husband in a senseless shooting and now found herself falling in love again; Doug Cullen, as Callie's older brother, he hated himself for not taking care of the baby Jessica and didn't know if he wanted a sister in his life; and many, many other characters. Lana and Doug had a nice secondary romance going on and Suzanne started to fit her life back together again in the book. The villains were great, evil and a little insane and a complete surprise (to me, at least). The icing on the cake was the archaeological and anthropological detail that Roberts included, which was absolutely fascinating. A great read - well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts has become my favorite female author and with each new release she proves anew her sublime mastery as a writer. I love the evolution of her dialog between parties. It is hip, ultra sophisticated, educational, always informative and just plain real. Personally, I adore her as J.D. Robb and her Lt. Eve Dallas stories most of all, but it is impossible to ignore anything she writes.This novel is like a tour de force, both texbook and site exploration, of an archeological dig with a murder mystery and hot,hot,hot romances tossed in to keep all the intensity glowing. It is also a very emotional exploration of abducted/adopted children and the reunion that confronts those who must meet their birth parents or child whether or not they wish to on either side of the issue.Callie, the heroine is just perfect with her sharp intellect and the veneer of tough as nails professional role. Her background as an archeologist who beds down in sleeping bags rather than in plush comfort accorded her throughout her life by her rich adoptive parents showcases Roberts' amazing skills as an author. She makes characters who are palpably real, multidimensional and believable and she can walk in any one's shoes. That is an incredible imagination.The author's own emotional maturity shines best when Callie is thrown for a loop upon learning of her abduction and adoption. She is struggling to develop a more compassionate self toward her bad-boy ex-husband who has been hired as the anthropologist on site for the dig's duration, and she is tormented by her lingering passion for him that has never been extinguished.Her greatest trial apart from being stalked by a murderer with herself as a target is in being forced to meet her birth mother who is a bit unhinged from her grief over her daughter's abduction nearly 30 years ago, and the reality that she is alive. Callie's struggle is to be open to her birth mother and yet remain true to her own parents. The pain is very deep and one can feel it.Overall, this is a bittersweet tale but one that is so rich with facts and facets woven so skillfully throughout her prose that it is another of Roberts' books that I found simply irresistible."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Though the hero &amp; heroine deserve to have their mouths washed with soap for their frequent use of foul language, this book is definitely worth reading as it's entertaining. It's suspenseful as well as emotive. There were no boring moments as the story does not drag.

I read it by candlelight during a power outage. If that doesn't tell how good this book is nothing else will."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I won't bore readers with my own synopsis of the book; others have already done much better than I could. However, a best selling author should have her facts checked carefully. I'm sure she can afford good researchers. No aboriginal peoples could have chiseled a cow for archaeologists to find (as they did in this book). They had never seen one. No cows in North America before 1611.Secondly, no university would permit a dig to continue with people dying all over the site.

I adore NR &amp; all of her books - trilogies, magic, mysteries, etc. and was excited to read &quot;Birthright&quot;, however, less than halfway through I was totally annoyed with the book. The main characters were so unlikeable, particulary the woman (why is rude &amp; nasty loveable in some of NR's books?) &amp; the storyline just bounced around too much. I found myself, for the first time w/a NR book, skimming through some of the pages.Now that being said, I am enjoying NR's newest trilogy (I've just started the 2nd book) and never find these magical storylines boring - different strokes for different folks I guess."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I liked this book the best of any Nora Roberts I've read - and I've read, and own, them all. I marveled as I read this at how much Nora has grown as an author, how complex and layered the story she told in this great book. Other authors have compared old bones to current suspenseful stories, but none has made me care so much about the current stories.In Birthright, there are not one but two complete love stories, and a third implied, all woven together with a sophisticated, suspenseful plot that kept me turning pages, absolutely riveted. What I particularly loved about the main characters in this story was the witty irreverent humor, the smart-alec tone, the brains behind the exchanges. &quot;Well that's...fetched,&quot; says the hero. &quot;Fetched?&quot; inquires the heroine. &quot;Not quite far-fetched, but fetched.&quot; Wonderful, witty stuff. You can tell that Nora's smart, and it's a joy to read these kinds of exchanges.For anyone who loves an intricate and suspenseful story that never takes its eye off the romance, for those who love brainy characters not afraid to act smart, and for *any* Nora Roberts fan, this is an outstanding book. Buy it! Read it! You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I just reread this book for the second time. I haven't read it since it came out a few years ago. I enjoyed it this time around as much as I did the first time. The book has everything, mystery, romance, humor, and sadness. It's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end. The main plot is around Callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on TV. She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant. After some investigating and tests, Suzanne is proved correct. But a baby stealing/selling scheme is uncovered in the process. Callie is determined to get to the bottom of it. While that is going on she has to deal with her ex-husband Jake being brought in on her dig, he's an anthropologist. I don't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed, reconciled and explored. Callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval. It is a wonderful love story and mystery. I think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents.

It's an ok story but I must confess to finding the heroine irritating to say the least and after she'd kicked her ex husband in the ankles repeatedly, thought that she deserved a good slap around the legs herself !"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This book seemed great from the description I read of it before it was published. The main characters (especially Callie) had promise and I liked a lot of Roberts' ideas. However I think there was too much going on at once in this book - archaeology, a new building development, a romance between two ex's, a long and complex kidnapping plot and several murders. I felt the archaeology dig was a rather dry and boring setting. I felt that the last few pages, as people here have mentioned, were really \\"mailed in\\". The ending was contrived to the point that you couldn't figure out whodunnit because you didn't even know more than a few chracters in the book anyways (and the ones you did know were the 2 couples). Jake wasn't all that well-developed, usually I think one of Roberts' greatest strengths is developing the males so well. I agree with the reviewer who said he/she was getting sick of all the Irish or mysticism stories, so I was hoping this book would be a nice change. However it was also disappointing to me.Frankly I'm kind of surprised by all the really positive reviews for this book because I found it contrived, jumbled, unbelievable and not very engaging. I think some of Roberts' best books are: True Betrayals, the Dream series, Public Secrets, Honest Illusions, and most especially, the In Death series. For books featuring sets of couples, I think Montana Sky and Sanctuary were great and Three Fates was quite good. Birthright is, to me, quite forgettable and not worth picking up, especially in hardcover."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"In an innocuous mall, a mother comforts her three-year-old son taking her eyes off her three-month-old daughter, when someone kidnaps the baby. Twenty-nine years later Suzanne Cullen watches a TV news clip about a Maryland archeological dig when she instantly recognizes her daughter, the site's archeologist Callie Dunbrook. When Suzanne makes contact with Callie, the forensic archeologist is sure the woman is lying because she knows she is not adopted.Suzanne plants just enough doubt in Callie's mind for her to sneak into her father's private files where she is shocked to see the adoption papers. Her parents swear that they adopted her in good faith through a lawyer who specialized in private adoptions. Callie vows that she will find the people connected to the black market scheme and expose them. Her ex-husband Jake is backing her all the way. There are some people who want the past to stay buried and are perfectly willing to kill to make that happen.Nora Roberts has written a very creative romantic suspense thriller where innocent bystanders having nothing to do with the black market adoption scam are killed; thus adding a touch of authenticity to the taut plot. The heroine and her ex-husband, who are slowly working their way back to each other, realize that some amoral person lacking any conscience is using misdirection to confuse and wear them down.

A definite must read for any Nora Roberts fan!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"When I started &quot;Birthright&quot; I was kind of skeptical of the nature of the novel. Boy...was I surprised....not only was it fast-paced...it was interesting as well. Though quite long for a NR book...it was well worth the time spent to get to the finish."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I felt the story line was very believeable. I have many friends that are adopted and often wonder &quot;what if&quot; this kind of story were to &quot;happen&quot; to them as they get older. We live in a very, very large world but sometimes the world is indeed very small.Nora Roberts obviously researched adoption on the black market very carefully. Only if you understand how a couple of any social standing could want a baby so bad to go to any length to get one, can you sympathize with the main characters' parents.I really enjoyed Callie and Jacob's characters. The way Jacob felt about his wife was very touching. It was like two separate souls looking for each other but somehow missing the point. I would love to read about their future together. Jacob's background would be a great book to explore also.As always, when Nora Roberts really researches a subject and brings her wonderful insights into the story, you can't help but enjoy every page of her books.Thank you for a great read. Keep it up Nora."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love Nora Roberts and she didn't let me down with this book. I didn't want to put it down. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The sparks between calli Dunebrook and Jacob Graystone are great!! Alsot he secondary romance between Lynn and Doug. The end was at a great pace. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the consatnt use of G**D***. I don't think I a being a prude but it was not necessary there are other words that would suffice. Otherwise it was a great book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This book is my first hardback by Nora, and what an excellent one. I bought this book at my store, and lo, and behold my other hardback arrived the same day so it took me over a week to read it. Callie is an excellent heroine and Jake a perfect gentleman'through in couple of confused and broken up parents, one who gave her birth,and the ones who raised her, and finally a few confusing bad guys and you have an excellent story. The only wish that I could make for thiswould have more one on one with Callie and or Jessie as she was originally and her parents. I was hoping that Nora would include a final chapter on how she was relate to all four of her new family. I also loved how her two mothers responded to each. If you love reading Nora's book this one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts has written another good romantic suspense mixing archaeology, murder, a stolen baby ring, and, of course, romance.Something holds me back from giving it 5 stars, though. Perhaps because it would not make my top ten favorite N. Roberts. Perhaps it is a little bit lengthy. Still a good book that I would recommend."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"When a 5,000-year-old skull is unearthed at a housing development on Antietem Creek, archeologist Callie Dunbrook is called in to organize an extensive dig. But not everyone supports the dig, which has halted construction and taken away local jobs. Soon Callie is up to her ears in trouble--threats, then murder.If that weren't enough trouble, Callie's anthropologist ex-husband, Jake Graystone, is also hired to work the site. And she's being stalked by a woman who claims Callie is her long-lost daughter, kidnapped at three months and sold in a black-market baby scam.You can always count on author Nora Roberts for a solid, emotional read, and Birthright is that. The murder mystery was intriguing, though there was, in my opinion, absolutely no clues that lead to the real murderer. The details about archeology and anthropology give the story a sense of credibility. However, the lead characters are impossibly gorgeous, smart, and perfect. Callie and Jake are in their late twenties--ridiculously young to be considered experts in any scientific field. Their sense of history--their memories of prior digs and what-not--would have fit better on characters ten years older.Still, a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was disappointed in this book--which never ever happens with a Nora Roberts story. I figured out 95 percent of the mystery almost immediately--and the romances were a big let down. This is the one books of Ms. Roberts that I wish I had waited for the paperback verion--and saved myself some money."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"A reader of fiction must, of necessity, give a writer a certain latitude with respect to how a plot unfolds. The problem here is that the writer went just a bit too far. For example, when the central female character discovers that she may be adopted after being kidnapped, she uses DNA to determine her birth parents, rather than relying on the footprint/and or fingerprints on her birth records. Fingerprints would be faster and more reliable than the preliminary DNA results--although the DNA results in this case were surprisingly quick, too quick, in fact.The plot is just a trifle too drawn out, apparently to fill the requisite pages. This happened and then this happened--without going forward very much.Again we have a strong female lead, rather, two strong female leads in this case, both in a field dominated by men: archaeologist and lawyer. As always, Ms. Roberts' women are young, gorgeous, a bit round in the heels, assertive, and overly competent. Sometimes a flaw might be helpful to make them more realistic. Still, the characters are not dull and that's a plus.As usual, there is an R rated sex scene about halfway through, with buttons flying, followed by some such scenes that are not described in glorious detail. With two female leads here, there are two R rated sex prelims, a bonus, if you will.The description of archaeology is accurate enough. Unfortunately archaeology, particularly of pre-historic sites, is an almost bogus science. Oh, it has the trappings, the grids, the recording of finds, etc. But too often it crosses over into fiction as the archaeologist speculates about the lives of people who owned the pottery shards and pieces of femur. Added to this is the fact that there is no historic record to dispute the speculations. Soon speculations become statements of fact, when we really do not know much at all about the shards and bone. This is particularly well shown in this book. At one point the archaeologist is shown a scrap of bone and dismisses it immediately as being from a deer, without any testing at all. Unfortunately too many archaeolgists actually do just that.Some Nora Roberts books drift into the paranormal and others are, after a fashion, whodunits. \\"Birthright\\" is in the latter category. The tracking down is perhaps too facile, but the outcome scene is pure nonsense. We have seen far too many of these, in which the criminal, once found out, holds a gun on the \\"detective\\" and explains in detail and in sequence exactly what happened, while supposedly intending to kill the detective. Nonsense. Why would the criminal not just shoot his enemy and get away quickly and safely? But no, the villain waits too long and is upended. And I didn't believe a word of it in \\"Birthright.\\"There is much to like, however, as is always the case with a Nora Roberts book. She has style. I just wish there had been a little more here."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I am a big fiction reader and a fan of Nora Roberts. I read lots of Christian fiction, really good books, and was somewhat shell-shocked to go from one great book that didn't need dirty, cheap language, to one that is filled with it!Come on Nora, drop the constant rotten language. Surely you have the imagination to let us know exactly what the character is thinking or saying without subjecting us to constant swearing."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"There's that old cliche about not being able to put a book down. This book was truly that. I read it from beginning to end in one long day, and I loved it. From just reading the description I expected a mystery, but this book was so much more. It was about finding out who you truly are, and what you have to go through to find that out. Callie was an awesome kick butt no holds barred woman who was portrayed as a woman who didn't need a man to complete her, which was definitely refreshing. Hats off to Nora for another incredible book!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook who is a grown woman and a very gifted archaeologist is a woman with a past she has no idea about. Her parents never disclosed the fact that she had been adopted as an infant at three months old. What was unknown, was that she was actually sold by an attorney who was up to no good with adoption scams.How Callie will find out is by a mysterious woman that appears at her door one day inquiring about her past. Callie is dumbfounded and seeks the truth.There is danger lurking out there, and as Callie continues her search, it becomes closer to her. This is where her ex-husband Jake will be of great help. In fact, they may end up in love all over again.A good book about roots and discovery. There is a lot of mystery in this book!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"That this idiocy masquerading as a novel could be published is beyond me. This review won't earn me many positive ratings, but in the hopes of saving just one person from suffering through this tripe I'm going to give it to you straight. Can you handle the truth?I was at the airport and had forgotten to bring a book and was forced to purchase something to read. I must have done something terribly wrong to annoy someone in a previous life for me to have chosen this insipid hokum and I must have been terribly bored to finish this garbage, but finish it I did. My time would have been spent far more productively cleaning out the johns on the airplane.Ms Roberts characters are ridiculously contrived and shallow. They appear to have been cooked up in the fetid imagination of a high-school sophomore cheerleader who didn't bother to take any English or literature courses. Ms Roberts has NO insight into the human condition. Her characters are all androgynous hermaphrodites. Her men are simply oozing with sensitivity lurking just beneath the surface. And her female characters are constantly getting into bar fights when they aren't insisting on having sex with the hapless sensitive men in the book. I guess her total lack of insight into human nature could be forgiven if she'd managed to craft a good tale, but Nooo-o-o-o-o. I wasn't so lucky. This storyline was so silly and inane that I am still kicking myself for bothering to read it.Do youself a favor. Pass on this travesty and find something (ANYTHING) else to read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Most people already know that anything Ms. Roberts writes is an excellent write! Excellent writer, excellent story!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"A very intersting premise and not a bad story overall, but I did not like any of the characters and the dialogue was at times, just plain horrible. I admit, I didn't read the book but listened to the audiobook on CD that I got from the library, I knew nothing about the author, but the storyline seemed interesting. It really took me a long time to get through this, I wasn't impressed enough that I think I would ever read another book from the author. Not a bad book, just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Every time I see a Nora Roberts novel that I haven't read, I grab it. I know that traditionally Robert's novels offer romance, suspense and easy to follow plots, and this was no exception.The story begins with infant, Jessica Cullen stolen from her stroller while her family tried to take Christmas pictures with Santa. Distracted for a moment by her distraught son, Suzanne is devastated to find her daughter is missing without a trace. Faced with grief and guilt, Suzanne eventually separates from her husband but starts a successful baking career. Imagine after several years of disappointing leads her excitement when she turns on the news to see a woman who reminds her of herself and her missing daughter Jessica. Enters, Callie Dunbrook, archaeologist extraordinaire, has been summoned to a \\"find\\" at Antietam Creek, the site of future homes. Faced with the fact that her whole life may have been a lie and she may be the infant taken years earlier, Callie must re-evaluate her entire life, and solve the mystery of who took her and why. Sent to assist Callie on their most recent discovery is Jake Graystone, Callie's estranged ex-husband who intends to woo her back. With support from Jake and a host of other supporting characters (a widowed attorney with a child, Lana; a newly discovered big brother, Doug), Callie is determined to discover the truth. As deaths start to plague the site, Callie and Jake soon realize that her abduction could be the catalyst of all recent events.I enjoyed this Roberts novel and would definitely recommend it to readers who like romance and suspense. It's a quick and easy read and has just the tight amount of twists and turns to keep you guessing, and a nice well wrapped up ending. I would suggest this Robert novel to all those that traditionally enjoy her works."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook is an acclaimed archaeologist at the top of her game, but one appearance on television changes her life forever. While working on a historic dig in Maryland, she discovers she was kidnapped when she was an infant and raised by another family. As she struggles to deal with her new family ties, the sudden appearance of her anthropologist ex-husband Jake Graystone, she also has to try to find out who is sabotaging the site.I really enjoyed this book! It is now one of my favorites. I have been on geology digs, so I really liked the setting of this story. There was good rapport and chemistry between Jake and Callie. They made a very likeable couple. The secondary characters were also an important part of the story. The biological family Suzanne, Jay, and Doug were well written."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It was great...of course. Roberts never lets you down. Everytime you pick up one of her books you already know the outcome; you're going to get romance, mystery, comedy and a well researched plot, of course there are never really any surprises, but that's ok by me...I know I'll always get my money's worth!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I know this isn't the newest of Nora Roberts' books, but I hadn't read it until recently. I really liked the way she treated archeology in general and these characters in particular.Nora Roberts manages to express the importance of knowing where we come from without preaching about it and solving a mystery and a murder while she does it.Of all the Nora Roberts books I've read (and I've read almost all of hers) there was only one I didn't like and \\"Birthright\\" was not it. I liked the characters and their interplay. The academics at the dig site and the people from the town had good chemistry both with each other and between the two groups.Another masterpiece!!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I have read this book twice since it came out, and I absolutely love it! The best part is that it involves all of the characters at the heart of the book, not just those mentioned in the plot synopsis. The characters were all real as were the emotions that they expressed.Callie is a recently divorced archeologist, who comes out of subatical to work a sight in Maryland where 5000 year old human bones had been found. It is there that Susan sees Callie on television, and is sure that she is Jessie, her daughter who had been stolen out of her stroller in 1974. Doug is Susan's son, and he is tired of all the women his mother claims is Jessie. He doesn't know Callie, so he feels that he needs to warn her away from his mother. Callie hires Lana to find out what really happened in 1974. She is a widowed mother of a 4 year old, who happens to be friends with Susan's father Roger, who wants her to get involed with Doug. Jake is Callie's ex-husband, who is still in love with her and wants her back. He is an anthropologist who is assigned to the case that Callie is working on. Together with Doug and Lana, they work to uncover a decades old truth involving."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I finished \\"Birthright\\" and almost didn't finish it after the first few chapters. Callie's character bothered me with her profanity and temper. I'm thinking by almost 30 a person should have learned more control. Her birth parents as well as adopted are loving gentle people. Where did she come from??? Towards the end of the book I got to where I could tolerate her a little more. I liked Jake's character and loved the end where he tells her he never signed the divorce papers. I had guessed that by a couple other things that was said but that was a fun ending. Unlike some other reviewers I liked Doug and the grandfather and of course Lana and her son. I skimmed a lot and almost didn't read the book because I have no interest in archaeology. I liked the secondary characters and would have liked NR to have gone a little further with the ending of the 2 families together and feelings a little more resolved. I very often think that NR shorts the ending. All in all it wasn't a bad read as some reviewers indicated. The whole adoption thing was interesting because I was taken from my birth mother when I was 2 and adopted shortly after. I found my birth family after my adopted parents were deceased. I could relate to Callie's feelings as your feelings for people who raised you as opposed to the ones who gave you birth are different. It's a difficult dilemma. For some reason my birth mother had raised my siblings and these were 2 different enviornments. We had nothing in common. I think in Callie's case the backgrounds weren't that much different. I didn't care for Callie's birth mother at first because she had been so obsessed with finding Jessica/Callie she destroyed her marriage and neglected her son. Later in the book she realizes what she has done and mellows some but sitll 29 years of damage was done. Some of the book was unrealistic to me but after all it is fiction so I have to remember that. I still didn't think the murder of the 2 people in the story were necessary to the plot. They really had nothing to do with anything going on in the book and a young woman killed both of them?? It's not a book I will read again but it was an okay read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Robert's is my favorite author and her books are the best...but I am having a tough time getting thru this one. Birthright doesn't project any of the detailed gorgeous scenery Nora is so wonderful at describing. The characters are just ok. I am still reading it..and have been putting down for a month now on and off!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The story seems to go on forever. It is a novel after all; a very long one. Each character possesses his/her own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession. The final showdown is worth the reading and waiting. It is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery - who is the person behind all the killings. Romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception. Conveniently, Dr. Dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case - her own. That leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth. The man she never gets over is there to win her heart again. Her brother who she didn't grow up with has his own love interest. A divorced couple find each other once more. Everything boils down to loyalty among friends, lovers, and family members. Not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. I ADORE this book. The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating. Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts). Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot. It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I've been a huge fan of Nora Robberts for years and this book was (as always) a pleasure to read. The characters were so realistic, people you might already know. It made me laugh, it made me think, it is really a great book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Archaeologist Callie Dunbrook has always been fascinated with the past, which is one of the things that makes her one of the best in her profession. When she is called to Antietam Creek, Maryland where a construction crew has found a five thousand year old human skull, she has no idea the turn her life is going to take. Once on site, she gets a visit from Suzanne Cullen, who saw her on the news and is convinced that she is the daughter that was taken from her when she was three months old. Callie is first incredulous and then, when it starts to seem like the truth, devestated. When she feels herself falling apart, she not only has her work to retreat to, but she also has Jake, her ex-husband, whom she never stopped loving.Anthropologist Jacob Graystone has been called to Antietam Creek, which gives him not only the chance to do the job that he loves, but to win Callie back. When Callie learns the secret that has her world crashing down around her, Jake vows that he will be there for her to lean on, and finally, to trust. Together, Jake and Callie start to unravel the mystery behind Callie's kidnapping when she was an infant. The tale that Roberts' has woven will horrify the reader as it is so easy to imagine it being reality.Roberts keeps the reader hooked with the danger, sexual tension, and emotion, not only between these two people, but the secondary characters as well. Callie is the heroine that the reader loves to read about, someone who is strong and feels comfortable in her own skin. Jake is the hero that we all want to know, an intensely dangerous man who just oozes sex appeal. Roberts definitely has a hit in Birthright!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It barely took me two days to read this. I couldn't put it down. From the first chapter she had me hooked once again!!! She keeps getting better and better!!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I must admit to having being spoilt by Ms.Roberts excellent recent books - Three Fates and Chesapeake Blue to name two. Here I feel that the standard has dropped somewhat - that's not to say it was'nt readable - it just was'nt great and that is what I've come to expect from this consistently talented author.The book had too many plotlines going on all at once for me - there was Callie the archeologist on an exciting dig, meeting up with ex-hubby Jake on the site, finding out she was adopted, dealing with her adoptive parents who had never told her this news, meeting her birth mother and her brother, brothers susequent relationship with the lawyer Callie hires to find out her past - she was stolen and sold as a black market baby - and then the murders start.......... I'm exhausted just trying to remember it all.As a result of all this, the characters personalities were under-developed and it was harder to get &quot;into&quot; the storyline, the supporting players who normally provide good back-drop and suspects for all the murder and mayhem barely left an impression and so when the &quot;final curtain&quot; came it was all a bit anti-climatic....Having said all that, it did hold the interest to the end and if it were a first novel by anyone else it would be a 4 star..... it's just not vintage Nora."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was impressed by this new N.R. book. I have been reading NR for many years now and felt her stories were on the decline, but this book was definitely a winner. The story involves an anthropologist/archeologist, and by far their work and the insight into what they do was the best part. The storyline was fairly decent as well - following the female lead as she searched for answers about her parentage. There were actually several strong love stories in this book - the one between the lead characters, the sibling, and even the parents - there was no shortage of romance, and the writing was believable for the lead characters since they were ex's and already had a history together. The only downfall in this book was the ending - particularly the last 3 pages - it was completely fake and didn't flow with the rest of the book at all; the ending was very rushed and didn't seem realistic given the intelligence of the lead characters."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The plot sounded really good a thirty year old Callie Dunbrook finds out that she was adopted and learns she was kidnapped from her stroller at three months. It was a major disappointment. There were too many plot lines going on that you got lost. I didn't like the main charactor Callie at all. She was raised in a loving home so why did she have a hard time accepting love and trust? Neither of her birth or adoptive parents had problems in that department. Even her reason for it didn't make any sense. She blamed it on her adoptive parents' relationship but not once during the whole book did you ever see an example of it. Her language was bad and mouthing off to anyone and everyone got old really fast.The real reason behind the murders was so farfetched it didn't make any sense neither did the end of the story. From the final climax you expect me to believe one person managed to knock out, drug and tie up four people? Would of liked Callie's relationship with her birth parents to of been worked out more. More of Suzanne and Jay working out their problems and getting back together. I did like the charactor Lana. Usually the dead husband is protrayed as evil or a jerk it was a nice change that she loved her late husband and realized she could still move on with her life and Doug. I did like that Suzanne and Jay were portrayed very realistically as parents who's child was kidnapped who find their way back to each other. The fact the person responsible for the kidnapping and black market ring will never have to pay for the crimes made the story fall flat. After all the suffering all those years Suzanne and Jay deserved to face the man who arranged their daughter's kidnapping and see justice served. I felt like they were playing down the crime making it seem less serious then it was. Sure Callie ended up having a great life but that doesn't change the fact she was kidnapped and sold on the black market. She spends more time whining about everything and everyone in her life then being angry about the whole crime. Her immature additude at Jake was annoying. Jake came across as a good guy but I couldn't imagine why he liked Callie especially since I didn't even like her."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Usually I am an Nora Robert's fan, but this book was disappointing to me. I find that the main character Callie is very annoying. There is so much thing going on in the book that sometimes it's confusing. The romance was not what I expected from her other books. I hope her next book will be better than this one."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love almost all of Mrs. Robert's books. Unfortunately, this one just didn't grab me and hold my interest. I thought Callie was, frankly, very annoying. As a big fan of the &quot;In Death&quot; series, I thought I saw a little recycling of &quot;Eve&quot; in Callie, but without her humor and heart. I thought the story line about Callie running into her true parents while on the &quot;dig&quot; a bit far fetched and ultimately I wasn't particularly touched by any of that story line. As always, Mrs. Robert's does her research and the technical look at a &quot;dig&quot; was interesting. Given all the books this prolific author turns out every year, I guess I can't complain when one of them lets me down. She is still one of the best writers out there for romance and mainstream romance/thriller genre."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I really enjoyed this mystery, Lots of twist.

Nora Roberts tells an amazing story, as usual. I laughed. I cried. Wonderful characters & relationships."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I found it difficult to like and stay interested in a main character who was rude, immature, self centered, frequently lost her temper like a child and who used foul language indiscriminately. I was also dumbfounded that a person intelligent enough to obtain her doctorate would be stupid enough to go to an isolated constuction site alone and confront a bunch of construction workers, yell at them using foul language and actually physically push one of them. And that was not the only time Callie put herself in mortal danger with very illogical behavior. I was sorry I wasted my time on this one."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright started out in a very exciting way - a spirited, independent, unique heroine, an archaeological find in a construction site, a discovery and a dig, and a handsome ex-husband - wow! Then it went downhill. There were too many plots, subplots and characters - it was hard to keep it all straight. Lana and Doug were interesting, but I could not sense any chemistry between them - their romance seemed contrived and fake. Callie and Jake fared better, and their dialogue was really sharp and fun (and I liked it that Callie had her faults - it made her more human), but Suzanne was just plain weird, and the mystery was a disappointment - there was no clue about the murderer until the last pages. Also, it was tiring to wade through the clutter of characters and plots - I found myself skimming parts of the book. I think cutting out the Lana/Doug romance (keeping the characters - I liked them, and maybe hitching Lana with someone totally unlikely, like Digger, for comic relief), and cutting out some of the extraneous characters and plots, and strengthening the mystery, would have made it a much stronger book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Though nothing can top the Reef as Roberts' best book to date, I found Birthright to be an exciting read. The characters were not quite so static as usual, although Jake could have been more well developed as Callie's ex-husband. I only wish that Roberts had written the first part of their relationship together, instead of keeping us guessing as to what actually happenend. Even flashbacks would have worked nicely. The only disappointment to this book was the ending. It was abrupt, confusing, and unsuspenseful. It seemed like Nora got tired of writing, and left us readers in the dust. I usually spend the entire book guessing &quot;who did it?&quot; but with Birthright that was nearly impossible, because the supporting characters were not well developed. The book had a bit too much going on at once-- an archeological dig, finding Jake, Lana's relationship, Callie's new mother, the murders-- all were a bit overwhelming. But Callie was a very real character, as was Lana, and they worked nicely. I hope Roberts continues to write &quot;fun&quot; books though, as this was a bit sappy. We need adventure in our lives, and we rely on Roberts to bring a little piece in.

I picked up the book because the topics of archeology, Maryland and Robert's popularity were intriguing. After 50 pages, I just speed-read the book to get the plot (mostly about an adoption/kidnapping, which was not what I expected). I found I could skip page upon page and still get the story (which maybe could be witten in 10 or 15 pages). I know Roberts is popular, but this book was like a worn-out, unnecessary, mediocre, lukewarm &quot;romance&quot; with potenitally semi-serious plot (archeology, land disputes, legal-medical issues around adoption) which drown amidst the &quot;need&quot; for romance. Also Roberts tries to sound too &quot;hip&quot; citing rock groups, etc. I felt like this book was really pandering to the readers. So, guess what, I don't recommend it!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I had to drive to Sacramento and back and so picked up a Nora Roberts book to listen to on the drive. Roberts is a great standby for these sorts of trips because her books are predictably entertaining and fun. Unfortunately, \\"Birthright\\" gave me trouble. Don't get me wrong; the story itself was of the usual Roberts high caliber if not even a little better than some. The problem stemmed from the reader of the audio version. Sometimes I've found that readers try just a little too hard and in this book, it showed.I appreciate the reader trying to differentiate between the characters by using slightly modified voices, but in this recording, it was incredibly overdone to the point of distraction. There got to be times when I would grimace when a certain character or another came back into the plot because the faked dialect was so irritating.If I had it to do over, I'd save this book to curl up with on the couch on a rainy day and choose another to listen to for 14 hours in the car. You may want to consider doing the same."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts continues to amaze me! I love the way she rights about families. She was recently in our local Wal*Mart store for a book signing and was so courteous to everyone and patiently signed everyone's book even over her alloted time frame. I have just finshed \\"Birthright\\" and she blew me away again! I have read all of her books that I know about and also all of the JD Robb series. What an imagination!Was very pleased to learn thru an article in November 2002 Good Housekeeping that the Kayla to whom she dedicates \\"Birthright\\" is her new grandchild! Many thanks to Nora and hopefully she will continue to blow us away with her many talents!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped. On the plus side: good sense of place, good characters (except Callie), good if improbable plot. Too much downside, though.Callie, the main female protagonist, I found beyond irritating. Why is it that too many authors in this genre have to make heroines like this? Instead of smart and strong, we have to have aggressive, profane, out-of-control. Physically and emotionally abusive. And of course, in moments of crisis, her thought faculties turn off. She has panic attacks, can't think, goes all wildly reactive and does incredibly stupid stuff. From which, of course, the male protagonist, who unlike the female, remains lucid and focused, rescues her. Gawd... phuleeeze.The good plot got overwhelmed by far, far too much inner dialog, too much discussion of \\"feeeeeelings.\\" Not that these were an inappropriate focus in the book, just that too much time was focused on them. I kept wanting to get past the naval-gazing and get back to the story.I've read plenty of Roberts, but this is far, far from her best effort."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"In a smalltown in America, there is some controversy over whether or not 30 more houses should be built in the surrounding countryside. So when the builders dig up the remains of what turns out to be a neolithic settlement, they are very frustrated while their opponents are only too happy to call in archeologists. One of them is Callie Dunbrook, a young woman who's very successful in her field. She is soon joined by several other archeologists, including her ex-husband Jake. Soon the sparks begin to fly again between the two who never stopped loving each other but were unable to get along the first time around. While they are trying to do things better this time and in the midst of the conflict between those who want the area to be protected while others want to build, Callie is confronted with her unknown past. A local woman whose baby daughter was stolen 29 years ago sees the similarity between Callie and the women in her family. When Callie starts digging, she finds out that she actually was adopted - illegally. But the people who are still making money by stealing and selling babies won't stop at anything to stop her investigation - not even murder...Nora Roberts writes a lot of books, a lot of them really good, some rather mediocre. This is one of the good ones, in my opinion. The archeological elements are well done and believable, the thriller elements are great, and the romantic elements are also very enjoyable and convincing. In this respect it's not just Callie's and Jake's story, which I enjoyed very much because it shows two people who really love each other, but need to take the time to really get to know each other and work on themselves to make their relationship work. You don't find that kind of depth very often in modern romance books. In addition you get the love story between Callie's brother Doug and her lawyer Lana. Here we have a man who saw the relationship between his parents go to pieces over his sister's kidnapping and who also has to develop as a human being to be able to risk loving someone. Lana is a widow with a young kid who finds it difficult to love someone again after her husband's murder. To a small degree, the relationship between Callie's birthparents also plays a role. So all in all, these are adult relationships in which there's not just blind passion and happy forevers, but people with problems who are willing to work on their relationships. I really liked this book for that alone. So I'd definitely recommend it as a good read. If you enjoy this, you might want to try the books she writes under the name J. D. Robb, starting with Innocent in death. To me they're by far the best Nora Roberts has written.Innocent In Death"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another. Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone. Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction. This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger! Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer. This is a gripping story...I was glued to the book till the very end."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I really enjoy Nora Roberts, but had been disappointed with some of her books that I had read lately. (Of course, they were her earlier works or the Harlequins, so it's kind of understandable.)BIRTHRIGHT delivers!If you enjoy a mystery involving kidnapping, illlegal adoptions, some murder and mayhem, AND the excitement and intrigue of an archaelogical dig, this is definitely the book for you!The dialogue is fun, \\"real\\" and snappy at times; sweet and relevatory at others.The best part about the book is that the \\"secondary\\" couple are just as interesting and just as well developed as the \\"primary\\" couple. This is unusial in this \\"type\\" of book and unusual in hers to this degree.Plus it's a real page turner! I read it in one sitting, and believe me, after just having major surgery and being quite uncomfortable, that's saying something!Buy it, enjoy it! I think you'll LOVE it! It's a great read for folks who aren't fans of hers az well!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts jumped on the \\"stolen baby\\" bandwagon with BIRTHRIGHT. When an archeology dig brings Callie Dunbrook to Woodsboro, Maryland, there's more in store than old bones in the ground, there are a few skeletons in Callie's closet as well. Callie comes to the dig site only to find her ex-husband, Jacob Greystone already there and part of the team. Callie agrees to work with Jake since this is the most important dig in her career.Suzanne Cullen, a successful cookie entrepreneur, sees the news reports of the dig and believes that Callie is her long lost daughter - the one taken from her stroller in a mall when she was only a few months old. Suzanne begins her quest to prove her daughter has returned.This is where it gets a bit confusing. Jake is still in love with Callie and does everything in his power to win her back. Suzanne is convinced Callie is her daughter and refuses to listen to anyone who says otherwise. Callie hires a lawyer, Lana, who is dating Doug Cullen, Suzanne's son and possibly Callie's brother. And there are other subplots too numerous to recant.There is an overload of characters in this tale and many come to the forefront and focus becomes lost. The reader is tossed from one plot to another like a piece of paper in the wind. There is the Callie/Jake angle, the Callie as a stolen baby angle, the Doug/Lana angle, the murder of a worker, and other small inconsequential stories.Even with the abundance of characters, most are well developed - the reader can understand Callie's anger with Jake, can sympathize with Jake when we are told what really happened to cause the separation, can empathize with Suzanne over the loss of her daughter and her determination to find her, and the frustration of Doug as you realize that his mother has spent her life focusing on her lost daughter instead of the son in front of her.The plot and sub plots are a bit convoluted and at times some seem minor and unnecessary. I'm not sure if Roberts had a minimum page requirement, or if she was just unfocused at times.Overall, this is a very good book and will entertain. It's not a brain quest to figure out the villain behind the murder, but it is enjoyable. BIRTHRIGHT is not Nora Roberts' best, but then again, even an average Nora Roberts book is better than most authors' most outstanding work."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Yes, I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan, but I'm willing to say when I don't like a book. Not the case with Birthright. I loved it! It made me cry tears of joy and tears of sadness for the characters. It might have something to do with my own adoption, but I really felt connected with Callie. Great job Nora!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"A good page turner but most of the character plots seemed to neat and obvious. You can almost guess the ending before it begins."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Downside: Jake &amp; Callie were very immature during their marriage. She accuses him of being unfaithful based on his past reputation and the manipulations of a vindictive woman instead of trusting him. Instead of telling her it wasn't true, he says nothing, walks out on her and sends her divorce papers. And she lets it happen.Fast forward, they're now working on a dig together. They each still blame the other for the break-up of their marriage, neither will take any responsiblity. I also didn't get Callie's attitude. She avoided love and commitment like the plague, and was rabidly independent. Why? She wasn't raised that way nor had an experience that would explain it. And it wasn't a genetic trait.Upside: It was an incredible plot. Heartbreaking, thrilling, funny and romantic all at once. The information on the dig was fascinating. I loved the secondary romance and ached for Suzanne and Jay, what a horrible experience. And although I figured out the culprit about half way through the book, the why alluded me until the end."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love Nora Roberts. This book just didn't make it for me. I didn't care one iota about any of the characters. I felt like the dialogue was coming out of nowhere.I really liked the plot. It was the best part. The romance was boring and unnecessary.I usually love anything that Nora puts out. I'm just glad I got this from the library instead of shelling out $25.95."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I am a fairly new Nora Roberts fan in the last 1-2 years, and can't seem to read and listen (audiobooks) fast enough. I enjoy her ability to build characters and connect the dots in drawing them together. When I first read about \\"Birthright\\" and it being about baby kidnapping, I wasn't sure I wanted to read it, thinking perhaps it would be disturbing. But I'm glad I did. I purchased the audiobook and \\"couldn't put the tape down\\". Nora is skilled in her ability to take this horrific experience in a family's life and evolve it into one of love and hope, while trying to figure out who did this and why it happened. And then Nora also brings in the suspense of murder to the story, as the culprits try to keep anyone from finding out the answers to these questions. Though a great story, including the interesting archeological studies, there were two points of disappointment for me. The first was the ending. There is so much \\"meat\\" in the story all the way through until the epilog. It seemed flat and rushed. The second disappointment was that I wished I had read the book this time rather than listened. Other audio tapes of her books are absolutely excellent, but I found this was hard to listen too. The women's voices are fine, but it's hard to imagine a sexy young stud when he sounds like a 90 year old man with throat cancer :) For this one book, read it!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"True to her reputation, Nora hits the nail on the head with another smash. I loved the book. (I always love her books.) The first paragraph drew me in and I couldn't wait to keep reading. Like all of her other books, Roberts makes you want to devour the story and leaves you craving more. If she keeps turning out the excitement and romance, I 'll keep reading and buying the books."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts has long been one of my favorite romance authors. I recently read Birthright and found as Ms. Roberts has done again and again that she had me gulping down the pages till the end. I not only found myself savoring the romance portion of the book but also was equally intrigued by the suspense, which this book provided.Callie Dunbrook is an archeologist hired to work at a site where relics of an early Indian community are discovered. Expecting a certain amount of the unknown, she doesn't expect certain other events occurring at the same time. Chief among these events is a woman who seeks her out and bears a remarkable resemblance to Callie. In time the woman tells Callie that she thinks she is her daughter who was kidnapped many years before. And as if that wasn't enough suddenly Callie has to deal with the arrival of her ex-husband. While they were married he all but ignored her but now seems to be very much in love with her. And then there are a series of mysterious murders that take place at the dig, which can't be explained.Once again Ms. Roberts has presented well-depicted characters with a plot both suspenseful and interesting. Touching on topics such as illegal adoptions, the rights of preservationists vs. land developers and legal issues concerning who profits from found antiquities, Birthright is another good Nora Roberts book which takes its rightful place among so many others good titles."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Archaeologist Callie Dunbrook is called to Antietam Creek to investigate the bones accidentally dug up at a controversial construction project. There she is unhappy to learn that she must work with anthropologist Jake Greystone, a former colleague and her ex husband. Together they must confront their own passions, a town divided about the construction and the very disturbing claims of a local business woman about Callie's own history that deeply affect her.As usual Nora Roberts weaves a great story that is fun to read. The main characters are well developed and easy to like. There is a perfect combination of romance and suspense and the plot twists keep the reader's attention until the final page."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love the setting in Maryland and how she describes the people andcountryside, almost makes me want to move....Having this much going on in one's life is definitely intriguing,just being able to enjoy how the story is written and told makes itall the more interesting...."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Before I picked up this book for the first time, I knew that I could expect a beautifully written, completely engrossing read from Nora Roberts. The story within a story that bound up a group of compelling characters was masterfully executed. The main character, Callie, an archeologist starting a dig in an area where a discovery of very old bones were unearthed, unknowingly came back to the area from which she had been kidnapped soon after her birth. Her birth mother recognised her, but while the reunion was what Susan had yearned for for twenty nine years, Callie had to reevaluate her entire life, and in doing so, began to unravel the web of a dangerous and profitable black market baby operation. At the same time her sexy ex-husband, Anthropoligist Jake Greystone was determined to get back into her life. I have read this book about 3 or 4 times already, and envy you if this is your first time to read it, you are in for a rare treat."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I will be honest that I was rather reluctant to start this book after reading so many negative reviews. However, I have been pleasntly surprised. Unlike many readers I found the character of Callie to be interesting. Just because a woman is educated, doesn't make them perfect people. I for one liked reading about an intelligent woman with flaws. Everyone saw Callie as selfish, but I didn't see that at all. I saw her as someone struggling to deal with a situation that she had no control over. I did not like the character of Doug at all. I thought the romance between him and Lana was just put in to fill pages. Lana would have been better off with someone who had a little more personality. It was very nice to read a Nora Roberts book that didn't have the paranormal mumbo jumbo that she sticks in so many of her books."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrooke is called to Woodsboro, Maryland after a skull is found by a real estate developer while clearing a site. She's an archaeologist and quickly determines the skull is a major find. Things get complicated when her ex-husband, Jake Grayson, is assigned to her excavation team and the developer gets aggressive about his work site being taken over. Vandalism escalates to things more sinister and Callie is also confronted with some surprises involving her family.Jake and Callie's relationship is complicated and fiery. Their marriage ended a year before because of communication breakdowns and it's obvious they're not over each other. Jake is even more endearing as he is committed to doing things differently to win Callie back and, in the process of doing so, wins the hearts of readers. His support of Callie when she's dealt some pretty emotional personal blows was unwavering and done in a way that best suited her needs. Roberts does her typical great job of crafting a compelling hero but falls a bit short with Callie, who comes across as difficult and insensitive instead of the competent, self-assured woman that you'd imagine she is in actuality. It was one of the issues for me with this story and I found myself overcompensating to make the romance work.There were actually three relationships involved in this story, which made it even more interesting and engaging. Additionally, the subplot involving Callie's personal background added quite a bit of tension and substance. Lastly, the mystery surrounding the sinister events at the dig site provided more layers to this complicated story. The complexities of the relationships were at the forefront and Roberts struck the right balance between them and they converged seamlessly. While I learned about the archaelogical process, I didn't feel overwhelmed by it and it provided a good backdrop for the story.I really liked this book and its emphasis on characters, relationships and family. The personal trauma the characters faced were heartbreaking and their reactions were realistically drawn. I liked the people in the story, even Callie, in spite of the flaws in how she was characterized. It's an extremely interesting book and is now one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Callie Dunbrook is an acclaimed archaeologist at the top of her game, but one appearance on television changes her life forever.

It is now one of my favorites. I have been on geology digs, so I really liked the setting of this story. There was good rapport and chemistry between Jake and Callie. They made a very likeable couple. The secondary characters were also an important part of the story. The biological family Suzanne, Jay, and Doug were well written."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I have been a longtime fan of Robert's work....unfortunately, lately it seems some of the story lines are becoming repetitive. This was refreshingly new and I read it twice before putting it down.There are several different curves thrown into the mix of this book. Everything from Black-market baby selling, to ancient civilizations & their cultures, to theories of ghosts & curses, to dealing with ex-romances in the workplace. Only Roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing.Here is the cliff-notes version: Witty and beautiful archaeologist Callie Dunnbrook, is sent to small town Woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site. Unfortunately, the town isn't that friendly. When people start vanishing, many wonder...could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves? Not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site; but her partner for the dig, sent from the university, is none other than her ex-husband, Jake!! To make matters worse local, famous baker, Suzanne (think-Mrs. Smith's) claims Callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant. Only problem is Callie wasn't adopted...or was she?Poor Callie must decipher clues to the past; Suzanne's, Jake's, the remains in the ground, and her own. As the old adage proves true, secrets never last forever!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright is a novel about Cali, an archeologist who is hired to do a job in a small town where really old bones were found. As the team members for the excavation come together, personal histories between Cali and one of her co workers is revealed. Soon there after conflicts arise and Cali discovers something about her past. In the mean time a confrontational, entertaining, and sexy love affair is re-ignited.There is also a sub-love plot between two other characters that is also interesting and cleverly intertwines with the rest of the plot. The characters are well formed and interesting, and very different from each other. Even our Heroine is very different from other Robert's characters. I personally liked her toughness, and how at the same time she was vulnerable. Kind of reminded me of Eve Dallas in the Death series Roberts writes under the pen name J.D. Robb.This book has a few traits that I've picked up in other Roberts' novels: The delineation between the softer character, who is very feminine and often wears the color pink, and the stronger one that wears jeans, and stronger (sometimes abrupt) colors such as red. There is also the element of conflict between mother and daughter, and her greatly developed strong but tolerant male figure.As most of Robert's books, the plot is well developed, intricate and has a few surprises. I think that this is one of her best novels (that I've read so far)."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I think this is one of Nora Robert's best mysteries. The book starts out with a tale of a very young boy waiting in line with his mom and three-month old baby sister to see Santa Claus. A familiar situation to any mom as the boy needs to go to the bathroom but won't say so as he doesn't want to miss seeing Santa. The little boy gets up to Santa and is suddenly so scared he falls and wets himself. His mom rushes up to gather him to her tenderly. She stands up and turns around and her infant daughter is gone. What a horrible tragedy! I feel for that mom right away how devastated she must be.The story comes back to the present with a very old skull found while land is being turned over for a housing development. When the skull is shown to be 5,000 years old, enter the expert archeologist, Callie Dunbrook. Her boss and friend, Leo, brings her and a whole crew in to work on the Antietam Creek lands. The owner and developer of the lands is not happy and neither are the workers he was employing to develop the land. Leo also brings in Callie's ex-husband, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Graystone, as the lead anthropologist. Some of this story is about the discoveries and how they are treated but along with it are two main sidelines: murders that occur on the Antietam land and what connection, if any, is there between Callie and the infant girl kidnapped at the beginning of the book?Of course, we also have the romantic plot line as Jake tries to convince Callie that he is there for her. All the complexities of this plot are well developed and woven seamlessly into this story with the emotions of the Dunbrooks (Callie's parents), the Cullens (whose baby daughter was kidnapped and may be her birth parents), her possible brother, Doug Cullen, and Callie herself. We also have the follow up on who kidnapped Callie and why and how her adoptive parents were fooled. Underlying this is the anger some of the people from the town of Woodsboro have towards the hold up of the housing development.A great read - hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Well, quite opposite of the other reviews of this book, I liked it. I was excited to see that archaeology was the medium used to anchor the story. As someone who's been on archaeological digs before, the portrayal of the site, events, and all characters was quite realistic (if a little fantastic at times). Callie fit the bill perfectly. Women who get involved in and make it in the world of archaeology are tough and sometimes they're mean. I liked that she never stood still, stood up for herself, and really did care for the other characters around her. Jake was also great, even though he could have been a little more developed. I thought the story was good. Was it realistic? I don't know that for sure but why read a romance novel if what you're after is realism? Taken at face value for what it is, Birthright was an entertaining story and a great escape from reality."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I love Nora Roberts work and I am always amazed by the quality to the number of books she cranks out a year.

Finding human remains over five thousand years old, Callie needs more help at the site.

Coinciding with the archeological find is the claim by local businesswomen Suzanne Cullen, that Callie is really her long-lost daughter, stolen as an infant.Tough, beautiful, and brilliant, Callie is the epitome of a strong female lead character. Her romantic sparring with Jake creates a sexual tension that keeps an even pace with the mystery, as Callie discovers that the accidents at the site may be related to her unearthing of her past including an illegal adoption ring.

Imagine my surprise when I read \\"Birthright,\\" an interesting story that weaves together plot threads of Callie Dunbrook discovering a new identity with the very interesting archeological dig, while rekindling her relationship with her very sexy ex-husband, Jacob. The story is interesting, and the characters well-developed - I particularly liked the episode where Lana has a bad day, instead of being as perfect as so many of Nora Robert's heroines are. The major attraction of the book for me, though, was watching Callie and Jake attempt to get beyond their problems and established patterns and really work on their relationship. That really sold me.I'm giving this four stars rather than five, because the ending was rushed and the climax UNBELIEVABLY contrived, but, other than that, I really enjoyed this book.

Not that anything she writes is bad, but this one is simply classic Nora, along the lines of \\"Sanctuary\\" and others of her best works.Simply put (there are lots of satisfying plot lines to sort out), feisty and beautiful Callie Dunbrook, a thirty-something archaeologist, begins work on what promises to be one of the decade's major finds--smack in the middle of the Civil War town of Antietam Creek--and discovers much more than bones and artifacts. A shocking truth about her past, combined with the equally shocking appearance at the dig of her ex-husband, anthropologist Jake Graystone, has her in a turmoil.As Callie and Jake struggle to work together without letting their equally hot tempers explode in the stifling heat, the mystery of Callie's past threatens to surround and destroy everything they are working for and everything they are.

Buy it and give yourself a real summer treat."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Robert's books are always winners, I am never disappointed with her stories or the caliber of her writing and this book is no exception. I am amazed how she can keep writing new and exciting stories.Years ago, a baby girl was stolen/kidnapped from the local mall during christmas- leaving a devestated mother, brother. Now, Callie Dunbrook is an archeologist who is digging a site with her ex husband. Suzanne sees Callie and immediately knows it is her kidnapped daughter- she contacts Callie, but callie know she is mistaken, she is not adopted!Of course, she is mistaken and Callie ( with the help of her ex husband, Jake) begins to uncover the mystery of her life. However, this immediately puts her life in danger as there are others who do not want this illegal baby scheme exposed.A nice subplot to this is Doug- Callie's natural brother whose life was turned around by his baby sisters disappearance. His love story is a great subplot in this book.All in all, a great book if you like mysterys, suspence, romance and intrigue- this book has it all."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was quick to complain over Roberts' \\"Three Fates\\" book, so I owe her enthusiastic praise for her latest, \\"Birthright.\\" Roberts is at her best with this story that mingles the discovery of the remains of an ancient civilization in rural Maryland with the heroine's shocking discovery of her true identity. There's history mixed with murder, mystery, love, sex and the question of what makes us who we are. I couldn't put this book down. I loved Callie, she's a tough and tender mix of brains and beauty with a quick wit. Jake Graystone, the love of her life, is a hero any romance reader would admire. The secondary love story is well developed and fun to follow. While there is never any doubt of the outcome between the pairs of lovers, there is a good mystery that twists and turns to the very end. Thank you, Nora Roberts, for a great read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"As someone who has enjoyed many of Nora Robert's works in the past, I found myself disappointed with the audio version of Birthright. I found the Narrator's voice to be extremely irritating and just did NOT work work for this reader. The voice she uses for Callie, sounds like she smokes six packs a day, and the hero (especially Graystone), sounds like a hick with laryngitis. Awful.The plotline, had potential, but it didn't live up to it. I was quite interested in the archaeological dig, and the community of archaeological workers, but this plotline got buried quickly under the subplot over Callie's identity. For me Callie's long-suffering mother reliving the pain of her baby's abduction over and over was quite maudlin, had me wanting to hit the fast forward button. I know it is callous of me, but I simply DID NOT CARE about Callie's origins, or what had happened to Callie 30 years ago. What I wanted to read was romance. NOW.Callie and Graystone's 'relationship' was unsuspensful, unless you like 'bedhopping and 'big misunderstanding' subplots. Graystone had potential, but the constant bickering between this couple left me cold. (There is nothing sexy or attractive of listening to two people bicker and torture each other). I also felt, that Callie as a major character of supposed intelligence acted rather stupid half the time. An example: Callie ran into the woods after a bad guy, armed with a can of 'bug spray' *groan*.The other romantic character Lana, I actually liked. She was oodles more mature than Callie, and handled her affairs in a professional way. Her love interest Doug, however had zero personality. This character could easily been left out. Perhaps this novel would've been more interesting if the romance had been between Lana and Graystone?Overall, I guess I found this book a disappointment. It had potential, but got bogged down with mindless melodrama over Callie's origins, and a senseless secondary romance and endless, endless whining and hand-wringing.Rating: Average, but poor narration loses it a star."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It is a shame that a book as wonderful as Birthright has such a horrible narrator like Bernadette Quigley. I had the unfortunate chance to hear Ms. Quigley on the Three Fates audio and it was done so poorly, I actually returned it to the store. I didn't check to see who was reading Birthright, much to my chagrin. Ms. Quigley does not seem to have a range of voices to pull from, such as a fellow reader of Nora Roberts, Sandra Burr. In this reading Jake sounds like an eighty year old man and it's actually kinda creepy. Most of the male characters all have the same \`voice' and you aren't sure who is supposed to be talking until their name is spoken. Ms. Quigley does an excellent job of reading Callie. She uses just the right amount of sarcasm in her voice and Lana is pretty well done too, but beyond that, it's terrible. I HIGHLY recommend the book, but stay far away from the audio!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This was a great book, and I just read it for the first time, even though it's older. A wonderful combination of loveable characters, good suspense, setting, interesting job for main character, and all-around good read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I am struggling to get to the end of the book. Too much going on and it drags. Three relationships, baby kidnapping, archaeological digs, murders and more. Too many threads and the pacing is thrown off by it. I find the lawyer/brother relationship completely superfluous and detracted from the pacing. It's plodding to the point where I am wondering why I am still trying to get through the book and no longer care about any of the tangle of threads going on in this book.I am listening to the audiobook version and I also have to add the narrator is awful. The hero (after you figure out who the actual hero is because of all the threads in the story) sounds AWFUL. All the male voices are terrible. Gravelly and I want a throat lozenge after listening."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"As an avid Nora Reader, this is one of my favorites. The story reminded me vaguely of \\"The Face on the Milk Carton\\" by Caroline B. Cooney, but this is the adult version. And to be honest, this version was much more interesting. I love when Nora is able to tell a great story, tug at our heart strings, and weave together not one love story, but two or three.The characters are strong and the story is intriguing. Nora is able to tackle something as sensitive as child abduction with tenderness and tact and create a story of love, family, and mystery.This is one where the book jacket description doesn't do the book near enough justice."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I must say I did enjoy this book, contrary to some of the reviewers. I didn't find it boring or stupid! There was a baby snatching ring in the USA some years back, so the plot was feasible.

I particularly liked the men in this novel, particularly the brother of the main character :)Over all, yep, it was fine."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"It's Nora Roberts....of course it was amazing. Very gripping. I couldn't put the book down! I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The book is another great masterpiece of Roberts.

She seemed whiney and stupid at unnessary times and calm and leveled headed about things that didn't really matter. She was pushy (along w her lawyer) which lead me to like and hate her.

Definitely a 5 star read i would recommend any day of the week."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I seldom can afford to buy hardcover books but I am such a fan of Nora Roberts that I can't stand to wait for the paper back edition. Hence I was on the waiting list for her latest. The editors writeup did not sound like something I'd enjoy but we often have different tastes.This time we were years apart. This was the dullest book I have ever read; and yes, I plowed all the way to the end because often times Ms Roberts saves the last part of the book for a smashing finish.Believe me, I could have lost this book at any point and never wondered again who did what. PLEASE wait for the paper back to bore yourself to death!!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I enjoyed the book very much; it was hard to put down. But come on Ms. Roberts, why the frequent potty mouth swear words? A &quot;damn&quot; hear and there would suffice just fine."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"&quot;Birthright&quot; is classic Nora Roberts. It has just the right blend of romance, mystery, science and great characters. It isn't perfect, but it's the best Roberts I've read in a long time, and I would say that it's easily in her top 10 books.The characters in &quot;Birthright&quot; are particularly rich and real. They are smart people (the heroine and her ex are both PhDs; the secondary characters are a lawyer and rare book finder), and dedicated to their jobs and families. You get to see the everyday lives and interactions that really brings a story to life. The romances are totally believable, and by the end you honestly think that everyone should be together. I have read far too many books with romance in them that simply rely on hormones and nothing else, and I was glad that Roberts stuck to her usual &quot;develop the relationship&quot; style.I also loved the archaeology and anthropology aspect of the book. I wanted to be a digger when I was a child, and I never lost interest in the subject, so I might be biased. ;&gt;For those who are not as interested in that: While Roberts certainly does not beat you over the head with the science, it is always in the background, and she brings the human aspect to it. It's not just big words, folks. She tells you why it matters to Callie and Jake, why they feel what they are doing is important, and she does it in plain language.I found the mystery portion of the book to be very well done overall, but more rushed the closer it got to the end. I understand why Roberts did it the way she did, but it was such an unhurried story that the ending was jarring. However, since life is often jarring, especially when it comes to big revelations, I didn't feel that the mystery's answer was unrealistic.The very end was kind of corny (won't tell you what it is!), but honestly after all the angst and conflict, it was kind of like a little treat to finally have some cornball in there."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Birthright was a fantastic book - worthy of buying in hard back. Callie is someone you can relate to - she is a passionate person - about her work, her family, what's right and wrong, and definitely about her handsome exhusband Jake. The story weaves well, the characters are credible. The continual links between the work she is doing and what she uncovers there, and how it relates to her own life and what's uncovering for herself, are strong. Nora Roberts - still proving she's one of the best."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"If you are a huge Nora fan, you already own this. If you are new to Nora, you might as well jump in with this one.Callie Dunbrook reminds me of Eve Dallas after she has evolved, and I love her. I normally can not stand stories where the protaganists are divorced, and I hate archeology stories. They are usually so technical, that I am not interested. Not so with this one. Nora as always made the book fast paced and entertaining. There was not the awkardness you would expect with the divorce. She handled that beautifully and from the beginning you knew, that they were not ready before, and were know, and that it would work.Jake was wonderful, and Nora did a beautiful job balancing the \\"stolen baby\\" issue, so that you felt compassion for both sets of parents.There is also a side story with her new found brother, and her attorney. It is great too!I won't go into lots of plot detail, many other reveiwers already have as well as the book description. I just highly recommend this book.If you like this, you will love anything by Nora, and I just found another author that writes in a style like Nora. Try Mariah Stewart. She does great stories about families and emotions with the romance/suspense storylines."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Wow - just finished and what a great read. Callie, Jake, Lana and Doug and their families are a wonderful treat to share time with. Love, romance, murder, and intrigue. And the story twisted and turned until the end. Click Buy It Now and get started reading this one soon!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Nora Roberts at her best: Birthright had all the usual ingredients of a great read with strong women, handsome men who just don't get it the first time, a mystery to solve and then a marvelous ending.Callie Dunbrook, aka, Jessica Cullen, as the story unfolds is a successful archelogist on her way to a dig in Woodsboro, Md. At the first media presentation a woman in the area sees Callie on TV and recognizes physical characteristics that lead her to believe that Callie is her daughter Jessica.Jessica was kidnapped when she was three years old as her brother Douglas waited to see Santa. The tragedy tore apart Suzanne Cullen's life, her family and her relationship with her son Doug who had been 3 years old at the time of the kidnapping.Solving the mystery of who Callie/Jessica's parents really are, and how it all came to be makes for a story with escalating suspense. Nora Roberts has so many successful stories under belt that it's hard to say which one is best; Birthright is probably very near the top of the list."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"this is my favorite book EVER i have reread it too many times to count because i love it that much. it actually got me interested in archeology/anthropology again and that is now my major. everyone who loves nora roberts should read this book!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This was the first time I read a book by Nora Roberts. And, I really enjoyed it.I did not care for the main character. She was too virile, and she seems like she is mad at the entire world. And for what? Maybe if the author had really delved into her personality a bit more, I could understand where the anger was coming from.I have rarely found any authors that write good dialogue. So, her dialogue could have been fine-tuned.So, I'll give this story 3-stars."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"My father and I both loved this story. The story started with someone stealing a baby and the after affects of the event. A mystery of the stolen baby and current murders add interesting twists. I enjoyed that the romance was about saving a marriage -which is a fun twist. My father told be it brought him to tears."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"This is the best Nora Roberts book I have read so far. I read the &quot;Jared Brothers&quot; which was ok. I enjoyed the book from the start but once I got into it I couldn't put it down. It was very fascinating. A wonderful book to transform yourself away. Yes, I have read better book this so far is HER best."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Dr. Callie Dunbrook is an archaeologist. When she is called back from sabbatical to head the Antietam Creek dig, she knows it is the opportunity of a lifetime. Finding a 5,000-year-old human skeleton in Woodsboro, Maryland is just too fantastic to believe. It is such a great scientific discovery, but as Callie will find, it is to become even more of a self-discovery than she could have ever dreamed possible.Once on site, Callie learns that her ex-husband, Jacob (Jake) Greystone, will be the lead anthropologist on the dig. She is very upset because their divorce was anything but agreeable. However he is one of the best, if not the best, anthropologist in the country, so he has certainly earned the job. Except for sparks flying with her ex-husband, all goes well on the project until Suzanne Cullen sees Callie during an interview with the local TV news. Suzanne is convinced that Callie is her daughter who was stolen 28 years ago when \\"little Jessica\\" was only three months old.Things begin to get even more complicated when the landowner of the Antietam Creek dig is murdered. He had planned to build houses on the site until the bones were discovered. Why was he sneaking around the dig site? Who would want to murder him, and why? Could Callie possibly be the same Jessica that Suzanne Cullen has been seeking all these years? How can Callie fulfill her responsibilities as head archaeologist without killing, or at least maiming, her ex-husband?This is the first Nora Roberts book I have read. If her other books are anything like this one, I have lots of enjoyable reading to catch up on. This book is excellent. The writing is wonderful. The character development and the plot are first rate. I am not usually one who cares a lot about romance but the author did attraction/repulsion so well in the story that it was truly complimentary to the plot and enhanced the characters' personalities. The mystery piece of the story was spun as well as any master storyteller could have weaved the threads.Unfortunately I wasn't expecting a lot when I began to read BIRTHRIGHT. Some highly well known authors have sorely disappointed me lately. Since I have never read anything by Ms. Roberts before, I was afraid it would be more of the same. What a refreshing experience to find this was not so. Her words flow so smoothly and the characters are real enough to touch. She made me care about the characters and how the story would be resolved. I can't say enough good things about the book, so I will just say to read it for yourself. You'll be glad you did.--- Reviewed by Barb Wright"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"I was given Birthright by a friend. Although I read a lot, I had never read any books by Nora Roberts.

This won't be the last book of Nora Roberts that I read."},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Wonderful story, believable characters, great romance with an excellent twist at the end. This is a must have for NoraRobert fans!!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Well, I just skipped the whole summary thing and go straight to what I think about it ...I think it was one of Nora's most creative books. The story flows on and on and on, I realized that I just spent my sleeping time finishing this book. Although I didn't care that much for murder stuffs ... I enjoyed reading each characters, and of course, the the love stories. Callie and Jake sparked all the way. Lana and Doug were lovable. Heck, I even liked Digger!! Great one liners (\\"No coffee, no brain. I'm lucky I can speak in simple declarative sentences\\") ... some crackled me up. And I loved the the last 3 pages ... I think it was kinda cute.A simple favorite"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"Where is the fire, the magic of our beloved Nora? It's not in Birthright. I plodded through it, page by page. Too many details. I could excavate an archialogical dig myself from this book - I guess some would say that's great - I'd agree. Once.The characters were pretty good, her typical fiery woman and man. But we keep asking ourselves, should we care?I finished the book and was glad when I did. Then I re-read some awesome older Nora works because she is the best - no matter what. And you have to read the best. Since she has plenty of other womderful works out there, don't bother with this one.Find one of her jewels and read it!"},{"Title":"Birthright","review":"The characters were very appealing in this book, and it was nice to get a Nora novel that was neither mystical nor Irish, nor the Irish mysticism combination. I'm not opposed to either of those things, but after reading over a hundred books from Roberts it starts to look the same. And the forthcoming \\"Key\\" series, god help us, looks to be more of the mystical same. That said, I would say that the main weakness of the book was a totally contrived resolution of the murder plot--- if you buy the motivations here, you're more generous a reader than I am. But I also, as with other recent books, wanted more of the main couple. If I'm going to buy a book in hardback, the couple has to be at the center and the suspense has to be well done. I keep looking for Roberts to return to the glory days of Public Secrets--- one of her best. The Villa began to approach the kind of Nora I like, but yet again, the main couple didn't get enough time. After Montana Sky-- which was great--- she seemed unable to sustain a hardback that placed one couple in the center. So I'm hoping she takes more time to develop her characters and the suspense plot in the future--- two things that have gotten more inconsistent over the years. (And another minor quibble--- as usual, her portrayal of academics, is ridiculous. They are all at the top of their fields by thirty, getting their Ph.D.s in five seconds, and NONE of them like to teach [and in this book, they somehow manage to be academics who never have to be in the classroom]. What do you have against teachers, Nora? While you've had a bunch of them in your books, they are always fleeing from the profession. I know teaching might not be exciting for a romantic suspense novel, but can't you ever have people going happily back to teaching when they are done with the danger and living happily ever after? Yes, I am a teacher, so this is a pet peeve.)"},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"Being a fan of Leo Laporte on Tech TV for a couple of years now, I just had to go out and buy his book. This is the follow-up to the 2002 Technology Almanac, and what a great follow-up it is. It's clearly evident how much more work was put into this book, as there are is a lot more substance. For one, every day now is now dedicated one full page, full of tips and tricks. There is also a very extensive table of contents in the front, so it shouldn't be too hard to find something you're looking for right away. Also, Laura Burstein corroborated with Leo for writing this book; she has included important dates in computer/geek history all throughout. Finally, one more thing that I liked was a very extensive appendix with computer statistics. Maybe it's just because I love statistics, but I found some of the information fascinating.All in all, if you are interested at all in computers, this is a great book to buy. It may not be best suited for the &uuml;ber-geeky, but for beginning or intermediate users, it is great. Leo writes with a very down-to-earth personality that does not treat as you as brainless computer user."},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"&quot;Poor Leo's 2002 Computer Almanac&quot; was awesome, but I can't believe how much better the &quot;2003 Technology Almanac&quot; is.

Maybe you've heard of a way to put your CD's onto an MP3 player and put hundreds of songs at your finger tips, but you don't know how to actually do it. This book is for you!Or maybe you will get (or give) a digital camera this holiday season, and perhaps after you've taken the pictures you realize you'd like to email them to your friends, but you don't really know how to do that. This book covers all the fun things in technology and computers that you want to do, but need just a little help getting started. It isn't that hard to do, and Leo makes it all easy to learn by following the Downloads of the Day or the tips that are on each day of the almanac's pages.(The only thing that I didn't like in this book was the inclusion of the &quot;Twisted Lists&quot; from The Screen Savers TV show, they seemed very silly and out of place, but maybe this brand of humor is your cup of tea.)"},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"I've spent quality time with Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac and I must say it is one fine publication. I'm a librarian and I have to pass judgment on whether to buy or not to buy hundreds of books each year. I can't help myself; I always look at a book like this with a critical librarian's eyes even if I'm buying it for myself. Do you know how awful it is to have a book that is chock-full of wonderful information rendered completely useless because the aforementioned information can not be easily accessed? Believe me there are more of those than there are ones, like this, that is well arranged so you can get at the info you're looking for quickly and easily. This has an excellent Index (I love indexes!), Glossary (a great addition and a very good one too), Facts and Figures Section (nice touch) and Leo's Little Black Book (very useful). Each page is easy on the eyes and flows nicely. Over all just a nice, nice job!There are three things I've found computer books to be in the past, complicated, boring and useless for my needs. None of those things can be said about this book. Not only is the information on how to do things like online security, wireless networking, and troubleshooting easy to understand, it goes one step further and makes you understand why you need to know some of these things. It never overwhelms you, it makes you feel you can do these things and with Leo Laporte's sense of humor shining through it makes it entertaining too. How many times has a computer book made me laugh? Cry maybe, when I become so frustrated I toss it across the room but laugh, never until now! Computers are complicated and frustrating enough, why can't computer books have fun to break up that frustration while they are teaching you? I've found the best way to learn is to have fun and this is one entertainingly, informative book.

It's written for you, whether you're a neophyte or an old hand, whether you're using Windows, Mac, or *nix. There's plenty in it for any user and, as much fun and as informative as the 2002 almanac was, the 2003 edition is even better.The content is extensive, relevant, varied, and refreshingly easy to read. The best additions/improvements over last year's, in my opinion, are the exhaustive index, killer glossary, and a really neat section of charts, graphs, trends, and stats, about computers, the web, technology, and how we use it all in real life. Every single day of the year has its own page with explanations, downloads, tips, and historical notes, and it has nearly 200 more pages in appendices, making it a true almanac.Part of my job involves helping people understand computers and the web, and this book has already paid for itself with answers and inspiration (in fact, now I have one at home and one at work, both bristling with post-it page markers). Information in it has saved the day for me personally on more than one occasion, and has made me look good to co-workers and others more than once as well...and who can't use that!Whether you're looking for a gift for a computer user or something for your own enrichment and enjoyment, this book is right on target. It's instructive, fun, and a terrific value."},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"I read the reviews people had left, some were not flattering.

They aren't exactly geek books either. Leo Laporte has pulled off the rather amazing feat of writing books enjoyable by just about any level of computer user.My wife and I are a good example of that. I don't make claims to great geekdom, but I'm more than competent around computers. My wife, however, is just a casual user - email and the web mystified her until very recently. Her primary computer use is just word processing, which she certainly became proficient at, but she has little knowledge ( or interest ) in much else concerning her computer.I had picked up these books because Leo hawks them incessantly (but not objectionally) on Tech TV. If you don't get Tech TV where you are, it's a cable station devoted entirely to technology - it's geek tv. Leo is one of the hosts of The Screen Savers, a 90 minute show that I watch very frequently. Somewhat surprisingly, my wife often watches it with me and, even more surprisingly, she actually admits to enjoying it.Well, maybe it's not all that surprising. The show is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and the hosts and staff are very upbeat, often funny, and do an excellent job of explaining technology in interesting and enlightening ways. A \\"technology is fun\\" attitude permeates the show.That same playful attitude is found throughout these books, and I was scanning through the 2002 version while my wife was reading something else. These are books you can just flip open and read because there's no real organization; just tips and facts scattered about in Almanac style. I was enjoying these thoroughly, and I had read a few little tid-bits aloud for my wife. Then I came across a half dozen Microsoft Word tips, so I handed that volume to my wife and picked up the other. After a bit of reading I started to feel tired, so I put it down and told her I was ready for bed. \\"Go ahead, I'll be right up\\", she said.Yeah, right. About an hour later I got up and found her looking through the 2003 volume. That's the first time in 35 years I've found her looking at one of my computer books. But, there's simply a lot of good stuff here that will interest anyone who uses a computer.At this writing, Amazon had a combo deal where you could buy both books for a good price. Check it out; I think you will enjoy these."},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"This is the followup to Poor Leo's 2002 Almanac and is sure to be a hit for those of you are just getting to know your personal confuser as Mr. Laporte calls it. It's not a really geeky book, but has many good tips in it. The organization is similar to last year's book, a tip for every day of the year. The first two weeks cover how to make your computer secure, well worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"As an avid computer enthusiast, I found that &quot;Leo Laporte's 2002 Technology Almanac&quot; satisfied my quench for a technology-filled read.Since it's not a computer manual, but rather an almanac, you digest the information given to you in daily portions. Each day is packed with little tid-bits of information that will surprise the computer guru in your house, yet at the same time the average person will understand.Leo will you keep you laughing throughout the book, yet maintains the professionalism you would expect him. I recommend this book for everyone: friends, family; you name it! Everyone can benefit from this wonderfully written book!"},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"Leo is the best &quot;geek&quot; on TV, well, and the rest of the Screen Savers set.

Fortunately, I bought my copy at a brick and mortar store who have a 1 dayreturn policy.

DVD, calendar? is there going to be one with useful information?"},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"For free, you can get all this information, better organized, and more up to date, through Google. The authors add nothing to the appeal of the material, and Leo's incessent harping of the book on his show belies the fact that this book is much ado about NOTHING."},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"For each day in 2003, this book has a paragraph about an event in the history of science and technology and a URL containing more information about the event. After that, there is a short description of a topic related to computing technology, a tip of the day with specific information about the topic and a download of the day. Most of the referenced downloads are either shareware or freeware, which can easily keep you busy for a long time.The topics are well chosen, as they kept my interest throughout the entire book. In general, several pages are devoted to a theme, for example eight days are used to describe aspects of computer gaming. Other themes are an introduction to Linux, health, privacy, macintosh, blogging and a guide for buying gifts for geeks. Of course, a few pages are not enough to impart extensive information, but that is not the goal. As a primer and a pointer to detailed information, it is an excellent resource.You could easily spend the better part of a year following through with all the information and software pointed to in the book. I have noted many locations so that I will able to return to them when I have the need for more data on that specific topic."},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"His 2002 Almanac was an awesome source of information. I still turn to it from time to time as a very handy computer resource. So, I just had to pre-order his 2003 Almanac. I was not disappointed! It was even better than his first Almanac!When I first got it, I read through a large chunk of the book. It is chock full of useful and fun information. I find myself turning to it each day to read that day's entry. I also turn to it as needed to look up something that I remembered reading, but now want to do on my computer, or for work. This book is a very valuable tool. I look forward to any more books like this from Leo Laporte!"},{"Title":"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac","review":"This is a good read for anyone with an interest in computer technology and web culture. Leo's book includes loads of tips, download and site recommendations, and even some Twisted Lists.

But even if your not a fan of the show this is a must have. So much information in the book. Each page is dedicated to a day and then each week is dedicated to a particular topic.

I can also tell you that the first lobotomy was performed on November 12th, 1935. How could I possibly know such vital minutiae? My secret is \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" a book where you can find such mind bogglingly cool trivia every day of the year. Leo Laporte also mentions that lobotomies aren't performed anymore and generally considered inhumane. I find that statement highly suspect. After all, someone green lighted not one but three (!) Yahoo Serious movies in twelve years.I bet when you heard the word \\"almanac\\" the first thing you think of is \\"The Farmers Almanac\\". Sure you've probably never actually seen one (I haven't) but you know (as do I) that it is full of highly questionable information such as predicting the length of winter by squishing a wooly worm and measuring the ensuing bug goo displacement. This prejudice does a disservice to worthwhile almanacs everywhere. \\"Technology Almanac\\" is classic bathroom reading, informative and brief articles (one per calendar day of 2003 day) with plenty of humor thrown in for gentertainment value. It is definitely not Mac exclusive but there is no anti Mac bias either. \\"Technology Almanac\\" is just a solid effort with plenty-o-coverage for any computer that a home user is likely to have. But there's more than just tech stuff, there's also loads of the aforementioned useless trivia and a pointless daily poll. . Generally I'd deduct points for the poll (I hate unscientific polls) but since Leo's poll is usually some amusing question I am going to make like the third prong of an electrical plug and remain neutral.If you're wondering just what kind of tech info you'll find scattered throughout this epic length almanac (it's a page a day but \\"Technology Almanac\\" has a whole slew of appendixes that stretch the length to 530 pages) you've come to the right place. On any given page you'll find a tip of the day, a download of the day and probably some nifty links. Sure you won't find every article super useful or every link a must visit but you'll find enough winners sprinkled throughout \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" to make the reading well worth the minimal daily investment of time. Heck part of the fun is turning the page and stumbling onto something useful that you never knew about before.Some books seem written precisely for some people and this was the case with \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\". Leo Laporte clearly wrote this book just for me, at least that's the inevitable conclusion if one judges the book's value by how many pages I have dog eared. I know, I cheated and read the book all at once instead of day by day, call it reviewer's license, but I enjoyed every guilty second.I can confidently say this will be a great Christmas/Hanukkah/Qwaanza/Festivus present for any computer user on your holiday list that leans slightly to the geeky side. Of course if you're really smart you'll run out and buy the book now and read \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" (be careful, avoid signs of wear) before the holidays roll around then give said book to a dear friend. Using my method you get to read the all the coolness that is \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" and you save $24.99 on a gift for that dear friend or relative.Bottom line: If you like trivia and computer tips, some worthless and some worthwhile, or know someone who does you won't go wrong with \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\". As it is I can tell that this book is not as great as I think it is but it is still pretty good.

Over the 18th century, through a combination of military and commercial means, not to mention propitious marriages, they came to control the East African coast from what is now southern Somalia, down to Mozambique. Their rule, centered on the island of Zanzibar, was limited to a series of ports and forts, seldom extending far inland. The Omanis made a lot of money from the slave trade, exporting them to Arabia, India, and the burgeoning sugar islands of Mauritius and La Reunion. As a rising power in the region, Britain attempted to suppress the slave trade, not always from the purest motives. When the export of Africans became difficult, the Omanis turned to clove plantations, using slave labor to work the crop. They also grew sugarcane and coconuts in Zanzibar and on Pemba, a neighboring island, and grain and oilseeds on the mainland. After a period of great profits, overproduction collapsed the clove business, plus the Omani slaveowning landords had become indebted to Indian moneylenders and customs agents. British power,looming ever larger, succeeded in separating Zanzibar from Oman, making two weaker kingdoms. But luckily for the Zanzibari ruling class, the rapidly industrializing West and its newly rich bourgeois craved exotic products. At the same time, industrial goods were coming down in price, thanks to wider and higher rates of production. Ivory, culled from Africa's then-magnificent herds of elephants, filled the gap left by the decline of clove growing. A vast trade network, dealing both in ivory and slaves, grew up covering a huge area from southern Sudan to the Caprivi Strip in Namibia and emerging from the roadless bush to a number of traditional ports on the east coast. Zanzibar traded in goods derived from the mainland (78% of exports came from there in the 1860s), and prevented other powers from dealing with the Africans directly. The British eventually suppressed the slave trade completely, ruining the country economically and forcing Zanzibar into protectorate status in 1890.That is the story in brief. Dr. Sheriff has written a detailed history from the economic point of view, rather than from the more conventional direction of rulers, diplomats, treaties, and military moves. He studies classes, products, and means of production and does not offer any moral lectures on the evils of slavery. I would guess that it was a mighty job to gather all the material, especially since, as he notes in just one small place, he could not get access to the Zanzibar records. This is reflected in the bibliographic notes, where he lists the archives he consulted-in the UK, USA, France, and India. The book abounds with maps, charts, diagrams, old lithographs and photographs (though his chapter on the hinterlands is full of place names that do not appear on any map !---not an easy haul for non-specialists.) As I live less than two miles from Salem, Mass. I was very interested to see the major role that traders from there had played in Zanzibar history. The American consul was long an important figure in Zanzibar and during the American Civil War, the Zanzibari economy took a nose dive. These are all aspects of my own local history that I was completely unaware of.In short, this is a fascinating history of a little-known part of the world which shows how it was inexorably tied in to the global capitalist network. It is not for general readers, but must be considered a major work for specialists, students of African history, and those interested in economic history. I am glad I ran across it."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"\\"It Could Happen to You\\" somehow manages to veer between being hysterically funny and loving and poignant without ever losing the very real, human voice of its narrator. Because of its breezy accessible style (think \\"Tales of the City\\", only in the first person prenatal) it would be easy to overlook the more profound themes beneath the fun stories. In the end, \\"It Could Happen to You\\" isn't \\"only\\" about the making and having and growing of a baby; it's about the emergence of a woman, the narrator Martha, as a wife, mother, writer, and individual. And it's a hoot to read, too!"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"I discovered these short stories on MSN, shortly after my first pregnancy. Some of the stories made me laugh 'til I hurt - others were so right on target they could make you cry. This is a great book to give as a gift to friends who are expecting."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"Martha's book is funny, poignant, and a fantastic read. I have read it (TWICE!) and have passed it on to friends who all agree. This is the perfect gift to give friends who are pregnant, moms, dads, husbands...everyone will love and appreciate this book. Martha brings humor and truth to the joyous and not so pretty parts (read mucous plug)of being pregnant and new motherhood. Go out and buy this book!"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"Not a very good book for those who are pregnant for the first time or any successive time, unless you laugh when someone continually says barf.Not really too much at all on aspects of bein pregnant, mostly on her life which is rather uninteresting and tries to create some sort of humor.Nicely edited, but look elsewhere for GOOD reading."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"When Martha was writing her weekly column of \\"Diary of a Pregnancy\\" on MSN Women, I would wait breathlessly for the next week's edition to see what crazy things had happened to Martha and her husband this time. I don't know how she finds something funny in every mile-marker of pregnancy, but she does! I was thrilled when her columns were published into a book - great cover illustration, too. I now give this book to all my friends as soon as they announce they are pregnant - seems to be a lot of them lately! They always report back to me as to how engaging and funny this book is.

You'll think of her as your best girlfriend who shares the unexpected reality of pregnancy and babies. This book is a refreshing change from all the &quot;What to Expect&quot; style books. I bought a copy as soon as it was available (at B&amp;N in Lynnwood), and moved the books to the New Fiction pile. I hope it made a difference. Makes a great gift."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"I bought this while pregnant hoping for a light read, and somene to say \\"it's really not so bad.\\". I didn't get that from this book. Instead, I felt the author was constantly whining about every little annoyance with her pregnancy and new parenthood. (Trying to do this humorously is still whining.) From complaining she had no time to herself, to lamenting that it was taking her forever to lose her pregnancy weight. At the end of every chapter, she would write some sort of sappy cliche about her baby, as if that made up for all the previous grousing.This book did nothing to encourage me or make me look forward to being a mom. It did make me dread the birth of my baby, but now that I am 6 months into motherhood, I have found it really ISN'T that bad. :)"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"She writes well but I find most of the commentary, ironically...rather infantile."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"Look at the subject first then read on.

I feel this is a special time in anyones life.I recommended: Dr. Miriam Stoppard books"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"I read most of this book, which at times were very funny and cleverly written. However, she praises her own mother for being The Perfect Mother, has no financial concerns to speak of, a passel of supportive familial babysitters, and cares way too deeply about dressing her daughter Lucy in perfectly matching clothing.It seems as though the author's work and family life are so darn perfect that I felt alienated from her and her experiences.I don't live in that kind of world, I live in the world of wierd families, financial worries, job concerns, etc. I much preferred the down-to-earth, reality-infused humor of \\"Diary of a Mad Mom-To-Be\\"."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"This book is NOT funny. It just isn't. Using the word \\"barf\\" a million times in a nonpun- not amusing. In fact the only time I laughed during the book was from a Rita Rudner quote. Rita Rudner- funny. The writing style is overly chatty dear diary. Annoying. I'm not interested in her dull life, only her pregnancy. I could get more insight talking to a random pregnant woman. It isn't even sweetly funny. I would love a good pregnancy book, I'm sick of the medical guides. But this isn't it. I welcome recommendations. PAss on this one.

In fact, I sent a copy to a friend who had asked me &quot;What is it really like?&quot; I'll let Martha tell her."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"If the hormonal swings of pregnancy are getting you down, a dose of Martha Brockenbrough could be just what the doctor (or midwife) ordered. It Could Happen to You: Diary of a Pregnancy and Beyond makes the perfect companion to some of the more serious pregnancy reference books - the kind that may be causing you to toss and turn at night. Brockenbrough has the gift of being able to see the humor in everything from morning sickness to labor to mother guilt - and, trust me, that really is a gift. A lot of mamas-to-be lose their sense of humor long before delivery day...."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"During both of my pregnanices, I read several books on parenting and pregnancy, and this is the only one that made me laugh so hard I ran the risk of snorting pop up my nose.Most of the books pregnant women read contain about seventeen thousand facts. None of these facts are funny, unless you count sentences such as &quot;You need four servings of dairy and an extra serving of protein every day, along with plenty of fruits and vegetables.&quot; This is VERY funny when you can't keep anything down besides Idaho Spuds brand mashed potatoes. Martha Brockenbrough gets the joke, and it's that brand of rueful humor that makes this book so delightful.Martha has captured the vernacular of pregnancy, sounding more like a very funny best friend than like your 10th-grade health teacher (the usual tone of pregnancy reference books). The humor is beautifully balanced with touching reminders that parenting is wonderful, mysterious, and a wildly unpredictable experience that will change you forever.Buy this one, but keep a Kleenex handy--you don't want to get diet Coke all over your nice new book."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"In a world where boring advice books are a dime a dozen, &quot;It Could Happen to You!&quot; is a lovely reprieve. The author's hilarious perspective of in-the-trenches pregnancy and parenthood shows the real side of having a baby. Her witty and sometimes irreverent observations on this eye-opening stage of life provide endless laughs -- and sometimes tears. This book is a must-have for all new moms and those soon-to-be!"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"Martha's book is hilarious. I read her chapters on line when I was pregnant. Now as we are attempting to have a second child I am reading the entire book.It is funny, makes you laugh so hard you cry and other times just cry because it is so sweet. I always leave her chapters with a happy feeling because similar things happen to all of us that have children. It is nice to know others go through the same trials and happy times.I recommend this to anyone who is prengant, trying for another baby or had little ones and just needs a good laugh."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"Loved the column (I've read it when I was pregnant), love the book! Any future mom (or woman having second thoughts about motherhood) should read this book.I cried, I laughed (my husband, my daughter and our pet looked at me suspiciously) I translated favourite parts to anyone who would listen..Martha, please keep writing."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"It did happen to me (well, my wife and me) and Martha does an excellent job of expressing the feelings and experiences that I went through while my wife was pregnant with our daughter. It's like she was there.While other pregnancy books treat pregnancy as an exercise in project management, Martha - and, in a few cameo sections, her husband, Adam - describe the human element of going through those 9 months. This book captures the fun, anxiety, amplified emotions and personal change that takes place during pregnancy.I'm fortunate to have spent time at work with Martha and Adam and I'm happy to say that these people are really as they are described in the book. They're nice, smart, funny and insightful - no embellishment is applied."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"This book is unique. My wife and I are expecting our first child in a couple of months. She got this book from a friend and insisted that I read it. Boy am I glad that I did. Not only is it hilarious, but its the first pregnancy book I have read with a chapter just for Dad's to be that actually contains useful advice. Martha's husband writes a chapter that had me rolling! This book talks about all the things surrounding pregnancy that other books gloss over. It's the perfect, light, funny companion to the pregnancy instruction books we all know about (i.e. What to expect when you're expecting). Martha has a unique style that really sets her apart. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"You'll enjoy this book. It's like talking with a chatty woman about parenthood, pregnancy, etc. The segments on many topics make it easy to read quickly. Colorful and funny photos with comic-like humor.If you're looking for something totally serious, and cold and medical, this is not your book."},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","review":"I loved this book. It was refreshing and witty. Martha looks at her pregnancy and the birth of Lucy as only she can with humor and compassion.

Although I found the diary-like style of this memoir to make for an easy read, I have to admit that I was getting rather annoyed and impatient with the author. As another reviewer stated, my life does not compare with the author's seemingly perfect life. In fact, I enjoyed the sections her husband contributed much more than the rest of the book! Honestly, I ended up skimming through the last portion of the book because I simply had enough of Brockenbrough's whinning and obsession with matching blankets with clothes. I mean...really?!@#! Maybe if I have a little girl my feelings might be different - for now I'm hoping that Jane Symons' \\"How to have a baby and still live in the real world\\", is a better read.

I had been searching for an autobiography of hers for months but never knew anything about her having one until I saw a post online stating that she had actually written one in 1965. The only book that kept showing up persistently in my searches was the one entitled \\"Stormy Weather\\", written sometime in the 90s. I was not impressed by the way the author made Lena to seem as some troubled and bitter woman who was ready to snap at any moment because of the difficulties of her life. Though i'm sure her past had proven itself to be challenging, especially as a black woman in those times, I knew that there was more to her than that. I was searching for words that no biographer could give me completely... and that's HER words and her REAL story. I'm pleased to say that reading this book is a joy. Lena is candid, honest, funny and fully aware of all the elements it took to get her to where she is and how she became the woman she ascended to. Any Lena Horne fan would be in pure bliss just knowing that they are hearing these accounts straight from this wonderful woman. Reading this book is like sitting down over tea and talking about life; the bumps, the bruises, the laughter, the dreams unfurled and everything else. I highly recommend this book. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Cyrano De Bergerac (Edmond Rostand's Play in Five Acts)","review":"The scene that has made Edmond Rostand's verse drama in five acts, \\"Cyrano De Bergerac,\\" a classic drama is the balcony scene, where Cyrano is feeding the inarticulate Christian the lines with which to woo the lovely Roxanne. Finally Cyrano pretends to be Christian and speaks to Roxanne directly, while hiding in the shadows. Cyrano loves Roxanne as well, but would never dare to speak to her in his own name, and the great irony is that he knows his words have won her heart, but for another man.The scene resonates because the vast majority of young men have experienced the pangs of love for a woman who would not give them the time of day. The reason for such slights might not be a large nose, but as long as it is something that is beyond our control, we can feel an affinity with Cyrano. What makes his plight more tragic than our own is because he is both witty and romantic, using words like a rapier to best his enemies one moment and then uttering verbal bouquets that would surely win the heart of any maiden at whom they were directed. Still, the Fates conspire against Cyrano, for when Christian finally realizes that it is Cyrano's words that have won Roxane's heart for him and tries to make things right, the young man's death cements the parts they have chosen to play in this tragic love triangle. After the paradigmatic love triangle of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, that of Christian, Roxane, and Cyrano must rank second.Yet in the end I find that the tragedy of \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" is not his alone, for there is a sense in which Roxanne's loss is even greater. For me, the key line in the play belongs to her, when in the final scene Cyrano is finally allowed to read the last letter that Christian wrote to his beloved, a letter written by Cyrano himself. The words are burned into his soul and it is when she realizes that it is too dark for him to read the words and he is reciting them, that the truth becomes clear to her. \\"I never loved but one man in my life,\\" she laments, \\"and I have lost him twice.\\" There is something to be said for a play that can be accurately reduced to a single line. Furthermore, in terms of romantic tragedy, the emotional impact of the ending is comparable to Shakespeare's \\"Romeo & Juliet,\\" a comparison already warranted by the fact the plays have the two most famous balcony scenes in drama.Rostand wrote \\"Cyrano\\" for the great French actor, Constant Coquelin, who specifically requested the final death scene. The play premiered on December 28, 1897, at the Th&eacute;tre de la Porte Saint-Martin, Paris. The fact \\"Cyrano\\" was effectively commissioned for a particular actor might explain why the playwright was able to take the French soldier, satirist, and dramatist, whose life had been the basis of many romantic but unsubstantiated legends into the central character of his drama. The historical Cyrano (1619-1655) is of interest for writing some of the first works of what we would consider science fiction, \\"Voyage dans la lune\\" (1657) and \\"L'historie des etats et empires du soleil\\" (1662). He was also considered a student of Pierre Gassendi, the writer of philosophical romances and a virile lover, so Rostand's characterization is rather suspect. But it is also one of the most memorable creation of 19th-century drama (along with Henrik Ibsen's Clara from \\"A Doll's House\\").\\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" represents one of the final examples of Romantic drama in France, but ironically the heroic comedy is the best known of all such works today. The only other one of Rostand's plays that has proven to be of interest is \\"L'Aiglon\\" (\\"The Eaglet\\"), a 1900 tragedy is six acts that tells the story of the Duke of Reichstadt, the son of Napoleon, who lived and died the virtual prisoner of Austria (Sarah Bernhardt played the title run in the first production). But clearly it is \\"Cyrano\\" that has made Rostand's name almost as memorable as that of his great dramatic creation."},{"Title":"Rypins' Questions & Answers for Basic Sciences Review (Rypins' Reviews)","review":"I used this book as a quick revision.

He began publishing around 1941. His work rejected realism, using elements of fantasy to mock aspects of human nature and convey existentialist themes. His playful humor, erudition and occasional use of the essay-like short story have prompted comparisons with Borges, though he lacked that author's elaborate style or interest in extended metaphysical constructions. A comparison might also be made with the outlook and some of the work of Donald Barthelme.This book was published in English in 1964. It collected 97 short stories, satirical sketches, fables, vignettes, a bestiary and other writings that Arreola had published in Spanish between 1941 and 1961. Essentially, it followed a similar anthology published in Latin America in 1962.It was divided into four sections. The first two, a bestiary and the author's shortest pieces, often just half a page in length, could be skipped with minimal loss, in my opinion. It was the works in the last two sections that showed him at his most creative.These stories were short, from 2-7 pages. The best of them were original and sharply told, showing people incisively in all their irrationality and absurdity, often with satirical or other humor.In one of the earliest, most serious pieces, \\"God's Silence\\" (1943), a narrator wrote to God asking for some sign of reassurance: \\"I see men all around me leading hidden, inexplicable lives. I see children drinking in contaminated words, and life, like a criminal nurse, feeding them with poisons. I see people who dispute the eternal words, who are called the favorite and the chosen. Across the centuries one sees hordes of bloodthirsty and imbecilic people; then suddenly here and there a soul that seems stamped with a divine seal.\\"To this, God replied: \\"To express myself properly, I should employ a language conditioned to my substance. But then, we should return to our eternal positions and you would not understand . . . . What I do recommend to you very strongly is that instead of occupying yourself in bitter investigations, you devote yourself to observing the small cosmos that surrounds you. Carefully register the daily miracle and take beauty to your heart. Receive its ineffable messages and translate them into your tongue . . . . There are so many topics to talk about, that surely in your lifetime you will only manage to discuss very few of them. Let us select the most beautiful subjects.\\"In \\"Parable of the Exchange\\" (1943), a merchant offered to exchange old wives for new, leading all men but the narrator to trade in their spouses. Given the human pressure for conformity, the narrator's inaction had dire consequences at first, before events played themselves out.In \\"Small Town Affair\\" (1952), a man turned slowly into a bull, growing horns, snorting and pawing the ground, and charging at people who stared back. Because he worked as a lawyer, many clients flocked to him at first for his aggressiveness in attack. But eventually life degenerated into a wild fiesta, and he was dragged from the arena.Some stories were set in the past. One of the most striking of these, \\"My Daily Bread\\" (1952), comprised what purported to be extracts from the letters of one of Spain's best-known Baroque poets. It consisted entirely of persistent, wheedling attempts to extract money from his benefactor. An equivalent for Americans might be if, say, Walt Whitman were revealed in his writing to be a whining beggar.Another, \\"Sinesius of Rhodes\\" (1952), mocked the intricacies of medieval religious doctrine, as represented by a theologian who believed angels and demons were the hidden movers behind all human events. What happened to the man in this story was darkly humorous, showing maybe what the passage of time metes out to such beliefs.Other stories were set in the present but looked backward, such as \\"On Ballistics\\" (1952). Here two academics standing on an old battlefield somewhere in Europe discussed what was known about ancient war machines. Among other things, the story seemed to be saying how little we can truly understand the past despite our never-ending attempts and fascination with its trivia, and how little human nature changes.Some stories satirized the superficial values of contemporary society. \\"Baby H.P.\\" (1952) took the form of a commercial for an improbable device to be strapped to babies, for the conversion of their nervous energy into electricity. It seemed to mock the desire for ever-increasing improvement and efficiency that some may associate with Latin America's northern neighbor.\\"Announcement\\" (1961) was a public service message promoting a certain type of life-sized doll for the convenience of men: \\"Our Venuses are guaranteed to give perfect service for ten years -- the average time any wife lasts . . . [each] is provided with a device which only you can violate . . . . She consumes as much electricity as a refrigerator, she can be plugged into any household outlet . . . . When [the use] becomes popularized we will witness the birth of feminine genius, so long awaited. Women, freed then from their traditional erotic obligations, will establish forever in their transitory beauty the pure reign of the spirit.\\" It can be admitted that in this author there was sometimes a hint of misogyny.For me, the above were by far the most impressive stories in the collection. Some other interesting ones commemorated Villon the poet, or took the form of a diary in which a good-hearted but narrow-minded man gradually came to look beyond society's opinions and decide things for himself. Others were narrated in the first person and went on a bit too long, with no particular point that impressed or was grasped.Another satirized the state of the railway system in what was taken to be the author's home country, as well as bureaucratic systems and modern life in general. This last tale, \\"The Switchman\\" (1951), is the one that's appeared occasionally for this author in major English-language anthologies for Latin America, and it's been called his best-known tale. Yet in their different ways, others of his are its equal or better."},{"Title":"Dream Visions and Other Poems (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Besides the excellent, scrupulously edited texts and Lynch's thorough notes and rich-though-brief introductions, this new edition contains a concise and incredibly useful guide to Chaucer's pronunciation that is alone worth the price of the book.

What a treat. It was a fast read which kept me turning pages eager to see what the next twist in the story would be. King introduced some characters to the tale that I had not had the pleasure of meeting in other Arthurian works - mainly Morgan's other children. He also did a fantastic job of evolving the story as Morgan's life from a six-year old with mysterious visions evolved into her reputation as a witch, a priestess and ultimately a goddess. Unlike the supportive loving sister of Mists of Avalon - unaware of her incestuous relationship with Arthur....Morgan in this book is cunning yet caring in an entirely new way. Her feelings for Arthur also mature as she and her powers mature. I don't normally go in for stories with lots of fire and dragons and shape changing, but King did it all very masterfully and mystically without being too hokey about it.If you like Arthurian tales - give it a whirl...I was very pleasantly surprised!!!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Avalon (Arthurian Novel)","review":"J. Robert King has done some magical things to the King Arthur mythos. Now, King continues his Arthurian story, in Le Morte D'Avalon by giving us the conflict between nature and warfare. This time, having told the story of Merlin and Lancelot, King gives us the story of Morgan Le Fay. Does King pull off a third great book? While it's interesting, it's nowhere near the level of the first two. A lackluster ending makes it even worse.As is common knowledge to anybody even semi-familiar with the Arthurian legends, Morgan is Arthur's half-sister who bears a son with him, Mordred. King expands on this, making Morgan become an incarnation of Gaea, the earth-goddess. Morgan foresees that her half-brother will bring nothing but strife to the land, and that he must be destroyed before he can do that. Camelot, rather than being the paradise portrayed in the legends, will instead be the catalyst for some of the darkest times in history. Ever since the fall of Gaea, men have subjugated women and brought nothing but violence and war to the land that was once green and lush. She is determined to bring it back, starting her own earth religion that works toward this end.As she continues her machinations against Arthur, she happens upon Lancelot, who she discovers is the &quot;perfect consort&quot; of a goddess like she is becoming. She is determined to win him to her side, and she becomes increasingly jealous when she finds out about Lancelot's fascination with Guinevere. This jealousy colours many of her interactions with both of them (as well as Arthur) for the rest of the book. It also causes her to make decisions she wouldn't normally make, jeopardizing her plans. Will she achieve the paradise on Earth that is her goal? Or will the representatives of Christianity and the Faerie folk defeat her?While the concept of this book is intriguing, I thought the execution was flawed. This is not so much because of how King presented the whole scenario, but because many of the events are just rehashes of what he put in the first two books, just told from a different side. At times, this works (such as Morgan's first attempt at winning Lancelot, when she and her two disciples try to woo him into their lair), but at others it really becomes boring. The ending sequence in particular (No spoilers) is tedious, with Morgan mainly observing events that happened in the previous books. She provides some commentary, but she's not involved. The ending jumps from event to event with no real continuity. Whole sections of the previous books are discussed in a few pages and then the book just limps into nothingness.While I'm discussing the ending, there is a really nice coda that really ties the series together. I thought that Lancelot du Lethe was the ending, and that it really worked well that way too. Adding Morgan to the mix, it brings an even more satisfying conclusion, as character arcs are wrapped up and the people involved move on with their lives/afterlives. I could have done without the very last pages, though, where King brings a modern-day spin to the gender issues that he's explored throughout the book, though. They seemed trite and unnecessary.This brings me to the main fault of the book, in my opinion. The gender politics are very heavy-handed in this one. First, the main struggle is between the &quot;male&quot; religion of Christianity and the &quot;female&quot; religion that Morgan sets up (and becomes the embodiment of). Thus, most of the men in the book are either would-be attackers or emasculated men, while most of the women characters are noble and honorable. Some of this may be because of the viewpoint we get (it's all Morgan's), so the shading may be understandable. Arthur and Lancelot are the only two men who don't fall into this trap. Arthur is pretty much a non-character, being the focal point of Morgan's schemes but not interacting with her much. Lancelot is the &quot;perfect consort&quot; so must appear like a beacon of nobility. King does turn this whole idea on its head later in the book, demonstrating that the world still needs what men bring to it, and that a world dominated by a Gaea-like paradise would be, though very green, very cold and sterile. It's a nice contrast, but it's hurt by the fact that there are no sympathetic male characters in the first part of the book. It all appears to be a bunch of male-bashing, and twisting it at the end doesn't help the beginning.Morgan herself is well done (until she becomes just an observer, at least, when she becomes boring). She walks the fine line between the villainess that we're all familiar with and a sympathetic character. King doesn't do as good of a job with any other characters, however. Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot are based on their portrayal in the other two books, but unfortunately you only get that if you've actually read them. Taken alone, they are woefully underdone. None of the other characters are remarkable in the slightest. King does a decent job with the writing as well, though his prose doesn't rise to the level that he reached in the first two books.While, in hindsight, a book about Morgan is almost necessary to complete the series he has started, Le Morte D'Avalon almost feels written as an afterthought. It doesn't read anything like the first two and it seems to be more of a rehash of events than is absolutely necessary. If you've liked the first two, this is a valuable conclusion to the series. But I'd buy it in paperback at least, if not waiting for the library.David Roy"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Avalon (Arthurian Novel)","review":"This is the third and final book of J. Robert King's Arthurian trilogy. Moran le Fey is showcased in this novel. And what a novel it is! We follow Morgan from her innocent childhood, cut short by Uther Pendragon's lust for her mother Igraine, to her obsession with the goddess Gaga whom she is determined to bring back to life in Britain.Arthur, unfortunately, is her sworn enemy, even though he never realizes it, of all she reveres. Arthur is the embodiment of destruction for Britain because he will be a bringer of constant war. Morgan wants to bring back the old ways of Gaea and therefore beauty and peace to the land and its people. She also intends to empower women and give them something they aren't familiar with, power and control over the men in their lives.A wild exciting ride through Morgan's visions of what Britain and eventually the world should be is riveting and imaginative. This book is fairly reminiscent of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; by the late Marion Zimmer Bradley. This story contains much more edge of your seat reading with immense magic, the visions of Morgan and her quest to destroy Camelot before it destroys Britain and the world.All three novels in this trilogy stand alone, however, read them all to experience the wonder that is author, J. Robert King!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Avalon (Arthurian Novel)","review":"Her age of innocence lasted until she was eight years old. It was then her mother caught King Uther's eye and her father, Duke Gorlois went to war with him. In a vision Morgan sees his death but she finds her father in her mother's bed the next day. Only she can see that it isn't her father at all but Uther, wearing a magical illusion to fool the duchess. A child is born of that woman and Morgan's mother marries Uther and gives birth to Arthur, the once and future king.After Uther dies, the queen makes an alliance with King Mark, making Tintagel a part of his kingdom. Sick of being under the yoke of men, Morgan leaves her home. She learns to travel the ley lines and work the earth magic of the goddess Gaea. She becomes a queen in her own right, always plotting to destroy Arthur and his kingdom of Camelot because like all men he seeks to oppress women while she seeks to liberate them.Only a talented storyteller like J. Robert can make a woman like Morgan Le Fey sympathetic and understandable. The world of Camelot is touched by magic and Guinevere and Lancelot are creatures of fey while the worshippers of Gaea grow in numbers until they are actually a viable threat to the Christian religion. LE MORTE D'AVALON is a fresh and colorful interpretation of the Arthurian mythos reading like a ballad sung by troubadours of yesteryear.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wilde Thing","review":"Janelle Denison has written a sizzler.

In order to get to the bottom of things, she begins to investigate the phone sex company her cousin works for. Steve Wilde, the devastatingly sexy Private Investigator, will help her get the job done...An illicit phone sex company, a damsel in distress, a gorgeous PI -- you get the gist. The sex scenes are hot and keep the juices flowing, but I didn't get to know the characters well enough to care about them. The missing cousin comes across as an afterthought, an excuse to get these two together for some steamy, uninhibited, albeit banal (the use of caramel during sex, phone sex, light bondage, etc), sex scenes.

In \\"Wilde Thing,\\" we are introduced to two likeable and inseperable characters who are already lusting after each other from the beginning.

But the hunter and quarry game they played through Steve's house was really hot! Needless to say, if you can't take lots of explicit sex scenes (or a man that really likes to dominate in bed) this book is not for you!But don't let all the sexual content lead you to believe that that's all there is.

But not until Liz Adams hires PI Steve Wilde to find her wayward cousin do they act on their strong mutual attraction. In order to find her cousin Valerie, who seems to have disappeared with one of her phone sex clients, Liz takes a job at the same place where Val worked while Steve calls in acting as a client. Of course this verbal foreplay just adds fuel to their already smoldering fire and convinces Liz's listening boss that she's hooked a client that will spend lots of money on the company's various services. As they were hoping, they gain access to the \\"playboy mansion\\" of sorts and uncover information that brings them closer to finding Valerie. Meanwhile, real emotions have started to emerge, and when it's no longer just sex, are they prepared for something more or will their relationship end once Valerie is found? Ms Denison has created a sweet couple that the reader hopes will find happiness together.

Both Steve Wilde and Liz Adams have been married before, and both marriages ended - his in divorce 6 years ago, hers in the death of her \`bad boy' husband before she could tell him she'd begun divorce proceedings. Liz owns a coffee shop, and Steve is a recent but now regular customer - he rides a Harley and wears denim and leather. On the surface, another bad boy. But both have been fantasising about the other. Now Liz needs help. Her cousin, who works as a phone sex operator, has turned up missing. And that's when she finds out Steve is a PI.There is a lot of sex in this book, from almost the instant the two central characters meet outside the coffee house. A broad theme of erotic fantasy runs through the book, as Liz takes on a job in the same phone sex company to assist in locating her cousin. The perspective shifts between Liz, who tells the bulk of the story, and Steve, but I don't feel we gain anything by it. For the most part, they are thinking the same thing. Also, the timescale of two people thinking they each are wanting a temporary fling, with the excitement and freedom that brings them, to a few days later both desperately wanting permanency, just wasn't convincing to me.The meat of the book is the sex, not the storyline. If hot is your thing then this is a good story for you. It's a well written book that flows well and the chemistry between Liz and Steve sets the pages alight."},{"Title":"Wilde Thing","review":"After reading this book, certain excerpts to be exact, I wanted to grab my boyfriend and try out a few things.

I have all three of the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; anthologies and almost kicked myself silly for nearly missing out reading about another &quot;Wilde&quot; brother. I cannot WAIT to hear about the other brothers...and cousins. Janelle Denison is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Wilde Thing","review":"Janelle Denison's \\"Wilde Thing\\" reminds me of the soft porn flicks that were so popular in the 1970s. There's minimal plot and even less character development sandwiched in between many pages of hot sex. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against erotica, but I was expecting much more when I picked up this highly recommended romance from a used book store. Without a decent plot and characters I can relate to, I am left cold by what could otherwise be very steamy read!Liz Adams, owner of a coffee house, has been eyeing tall, dark, handsome, bad boy Steve Wilde when he comes in for his daily caramel frappuccino, extra caramel - do bad boys really drink this stuff?? Wilde has obviously been checking Liz out too. When Liz' cousin goes missing, she is advised by a friend to call on Wilde, who is an excellent PI. She does and they really get it on - no strings.Liz' cousin Valerie is a phone sex operator and party girl. She was supposed to be going away for a weekend with someone she met \\"on the job,\\" but after almost a week goes by and no Val, Liz feels that something bad may have happened to her. Steve and Liz both think that the only way to get information on Val's client/boyfriend is for Liz to go undercover as a phone sex operator at \\"The Ultimate Fantasy.\\" Much phone sex and a big, bad party later the mystery is almost solved and lust has turned to love for P.I. Wilde - but Liz is afraid to commit. You can take it from there.I will say that the erotica is well written, and I probably would have rated this higher than 3 stars if there had been more meat to the plot.JANA"},{"Title":"Wilde Thing","review":"I'm normally a big fan of romance fiction that has a spicier flavor, but the plot in this book was so contrived I ended up rolling my eyes more often than not. I could almost picture the author sitting at her computer thinking, \\"Hmmmm, how can I get my characters in as many sex scenes as possible? *fingersnap* I'll have her work as a phone sex operator! Hmmmm, wait. Where's the romance in that? I've got it! She's only doing it to find her missing cousin! Yeah, that's the ticket.\\" How ridiculous is that?! Yes, the sex scenes were hot and if that's all you're looking for, then this book is for you. I felt I knew nothing about the hero and heroine except that they loved uninhibited sex. Well gee - alert the media! What a groundbreaking idea!It's a shame that character development was backburnered in favor of explicit sex scenes. I've always found those scenes carry much more impact when you care about the hero and heroine. If you don't believe me, try reading Susan Donovan, Lori Foster or Shannon McKenna. They know how to develop characters that you care about."},{"Title":"Wilde Thing","review":"When I picked up Wilde Thing by Janelle Denison, I knew the book was supposed to be sexy and steamy and all things a romance novel should be. I am by no means a prude and I can enjoy a well-written sex scene as much as the next gal. I should also add that this book is well-written. Denison's style is smooth, the sensations and emotions created between her two characters -- Liz Adams and Steve Wilde -- in the bedroom throw sparks off the pages.Page 29, in fact. And that's part of the problem.Liz Adams, owner of The Daily Grind coffeehouse, and Steve Wilde, a PI, have been bumping into each other for a couple of months, but not speaking. The attraction they feel toward each other is the \\"across the room\\" kind so, when Liz heads over to Steve's PI business to hire him to find her missing cousin and she's already in his lap (literally) by the end of the first chapter, rolling into a quasi-sex scene by Chapter Two when they've only been speaking to each other for a couple of minutes... The book started to lose me.There is a difference to me between hot, steamy sex in a romance novel and lust, and this one of the problems I have with a lot of romance novels lately. When I close the book, I want to feel satisfied (and I'm not talking sexually). I want to believe that the hero and the heroine have found THE person they are supposed to be with. That they love each other, and that that love will last them a lifetime.With Wilde Thing, I didn't feel that way. I felt like all these two had between them was good sex. It didn't strike me as love, it struck me as two people in heat. And heat doesn't last. I didn't \\"get\\" why Liz and Steve were right for each other. I actually shut the book thinking they'd burn out before too long and go their seperate ways. That's disappointing in a love story.Basically the plot was thin and the whole bit about Liz's missing cousin working for a phone sex place seemed contrived for the sole purpose of allowing Liz and Steve to talk about sex on the rare instances that they weren't having sex.

The crimes were committed in the eighties, but I only came to know the villages many years later, when I worked in Narborough (the middle of the three villages) from 1998 to 2002. I heard occasional references to these crimes, although never any in-depth conversations. Even now, the topic is too sensitive, so the only way I could find out what really happened was via this book.Wambaugh gives an excellent account of the crimes and the often futile attempts to solve them. Perhaps occasionally it is more graphic than it needs to be, describing the state of the bodies in intimate detail, but its easy to gloss over that (it is in print, not on film) and there's not too much of that. Some of the main characters, including the policemen and their suspects, are described in great detail. While some may feel that this is just padding, I feel it all helps to make it a good story.Again, plenty of pages are devoted to false leads, but this may help us to understand why detective work is never as simple as we would like it to be. At one point, after the second murder, the police think they've got their man. The parents can't believe that he would do such a thing and it is at that point that the new science of DNA testing is brought in. The parents are convinced their son in innocent. The police are convinced that he is not only guilty of that murder, but also the earlier one. Did the same man commit both murders and was this particular man guilty? The DNA test results eventually provide answers, but to find out what those answers were, you must read the book."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"I read some of the other reviews of this book and found the last 2 to be completely incorrect. This is in fact, not a book for the weak at heart, but it never promises to be. This is very graphic and detailed. So, if you don't like this, don't read this book, but for other true crime fanatics like myself, you will most assuredly love this read. It starts in high gear and stays there throughout. There are no long intros or set-ups, this book hits the ground running and will never leave you thinking that your time could be better spent as some of the other reviews suggest. Sure, if you can't handle the bloodiness and truth of true crime, then go curl up in a corner and read a Harry Potter book!"},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"A fifteen year old girl is raped and strangled, her body left along a footpath near an English Village called Narborough. Though a massive effort is launch to find the killer, he remains at large for years. Then the Killer strikes three years after the first murder, killing another young girl in the same brutal fashion, and leaving her body only a short distance from the first. The police do not give up, but this man continually evades detection until several years later Scotland Yard comes a calling with a new tool: DNA. The first time its was used to solve a police case, and to actually track a killer not just to reinforce a case. In a very controversial move, nearly 4000 men in and around the town of Narborough are tested, everyone from teen to old man are 'blooded' meaning their DNA of their blood is tested against the samples of the killer. Never has any police force taken such a massive Orwellian move, compelling every male able to commit the crime to come forward for testing. Even so, the killer continually evades being blooded, but it was a matter of time and dogged police work.Warbaugh's best work since The Onion Field, may be uncomfortable for some people because of the details of the murders etc, others - believers of the right of individual - will be upset with the Orwellian dragnet, but its a fascinating detailed account that often compels as repels in the same breath."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"I'm a big fan of the forensic programs on Court TV, and I always check the date of the featured crime (almost always murder and/or rape) to see if it occurred before or after DNA testing became common in the United States.

It's also the story of the first time that DNA was used in solving a crime. The girls were killed four years apart, both being young and both virgins. The killer raped and sodomised the girls before strangling them, merely pulling their bodies off the beaten village pathway. It's not a pretty story but the true account of the extraordinary effort by the police to find the killer, eventually using the new method of DNA testing from blood and semen samples given by thousands of local men and boys, and called by the police \\"blooding\\". The staggering thing is that the killer was, and is, a sociopath who has absolutely no conscience or feeling that what he did was in any way wrong, and that while he wasn't labeled as criminally insane, even with these horrific crimes, he is simply a vile man whose mind is wired in this way.

A year later, in another part of the same county, Dr. Alec Jeffreys uncovered something called a genetic fingerprint, of which no two are alike unless they belong to identical twins.With that, the biological leftovers of the killer's attack became evidence that could theoretically put him away, if he can first be persuaded to take a voluntary test.Joseph Wambaugh's 1989 true-crime story \\"The Blooding\\" is perhaps the author's most accomplished book, as he delves headlong into a strange netherworld where science and crime intersect, both in terms of genetic fingerprinting of which this case provided the first working model, and of the psychopathic mind of the killer, whom Wambaugh studies at length in the book's second half.\\"The Blooding\\" captures a small British community in a state of terror, and details a frustrating, often misguided investigation that gets its man only after much confusion. \\"As with many police investigations the secret ways of people often produced peripheral mysteries as baffling as the one in question,\\" Wambaugh writes, and to his credit he follows at least a couple of them at such length you think you are about to discover the killer at last before hitting a dead end.Say this for Wambaugh: No one else makes police investigation seem so thrilling and comprehensible, and at the same time so worthy of respect. Here he is working far away from his California home base, but the differences in culture and police technique only seem to serve to sharpen his focus. He even manages to delineate a few of the key investigators, though here, unlike his more famous \\"The Onion Field\\", Wambaugh's interest remains firmly on the case at hand, however absorbingly he may portray certain indescribable emotions, like that of a father called upon to identify the body of his daughter, \\"the cruelest, most ravaging sight this world has to offer,\\" he writes.As Wambaugh notes at another point, \\"murder annihilates privacy,\\" and in this case this means not only the agony of a murder victim's parents but the ethical question of mass-collecting DNA samples for possible use against a suspect. For it is clear without this innovation of Dr. Jeffreys' and its employment by the Leicestershire constabulary, a killer would have gone free, perhaps while an innocent man was put away.Humane, electric, alive both to individual moments large and small as well as to the overall significance of the case, \\"The Blooding\\" is so good you may close it as I did feeling guilty you enjoyed a book so given the circumstances that produced it."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"This gripping narrative details the first use of DNA fingerprinting in a murder case. In 1984 British authorities found the raped and strangled body of teenager Lynda Mann in the woods near Narborough, England. With a possible suspect in custody, a local scientist named Alec Jeffreys persuaded detectives to let him use the suspect's blood in a new DNA procedure that could certify the young man's guilt. Authorities quickly agreed, but to everybody's surprise the results showed the suspect to be innocent. When young Dawn Ashworth was found similarly brutalized three years later, DNA testing showed that the same fiend had committed both crimes. Scotland Yard then ordered every male in the district to submit a blood sample in a massive (and ultimately successful) search for the killer.Author Joseph Waumbaugh applies his straightforward, readable style in THE BLOODING. He teaches us about the two crimes, the British legal system, the false leads that are part of detective work, and initial skepticism toward DNA fingerprinting. Wambaugh also shows how this now-common technique helped authorities clear an innocent suspect and eventually catch a brutal killer."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"I lived in Narborough between 1960 and 2004 and was one of first set of people to be tested as my home was less than a couple of miles from the murder sites. Despite much local outrage at this book I feel it does reflect the way we all felt. It is a long time ago now but rarely spoken about. Narborough is still considered a village by the locals - not a town - and this book is well worth a look. If you ever visit just don't talk about it!"},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"This starts as an &quot;ordinary murder mystery.&quot; It's pace is fast, even though the crime solving process is painstaking. Wambaugh describes the early days of DNA, resistance to it, and skepticism about it, from the public, the police, and even from science. The British police and science use DNA to eliminate suspects, and finally, identify the bloody murderer. Told in chilling Wambaugh fashion.

It was the first in the world. This book lacks an index, a table of contents, and pictures. Wambaugh recreated events from reliable witnesses or independent corroboration. Two 15 year old girls were raped and strangled three years apart. Could an innocent suspect confess to murder? Can DNA testing be defeated? [This shows an England that is not in the tourist press. The writing shows Wambaugh's skill, it reads like a fast-paced novel.] Details of the crimes are accurately described.Chapter 1 describes the three small villages. Leicestershire is the site of Bosworth Field, Richard III the last Plantagenet. The half-nude body of a 15 year old was discovered one morning (Chapter 4). People were scared and alarmed by the murder (Chapter 6). The body was found near a mental hospital. People were terrified, they had no protection. The police followed every lead, anonymous or not. After months of investigation it was shut down. Chapter 9 tells of the discovery pf DNA analysis at nearby Leicester University. [What is a \\"donkey jacket\\" (p.75)?] Further investigation continued into DNA (Chapter 10). Everyone's DNA is different except for identical twins. The murder of a child creates additional problems for the family. A suspect was arrested for the second murder (Chapter 14). The suspect confessed after being questioned by the police (Chapter 15). The family of the victim also had problems (Chapter 16). In order to prove the suspect murdered the first girl they used DNA analysis (Chapter 17). The result: one man raped and murdered both girls, but it wasn't the suspect in custody! The television program \\"Crimewatch UK\\" showed a recreation of the murder and asked for clues (Chapter 18). The police continued to check all reports.The police tried a new tactic; they would test the blood of all male residents who were in an age group (Chapter 19). There were no identity cards in England then. Chapter 22 tells how one blood test was done. [If anyone tells you a hard-luck to gain your sympathy you should assume it's a confidence trick.] Chapter 23 describes the scientific precision of the testing. At one unguarded moment a man told of taking a blooding test for another. Someone repeated this to the police, who compared signatures and got a break. \\"He looks the way our man ought to look!\\" (Chapter 26). The confession showed neither remorse or emotion. Real life confessions are rarely tidy. One girl survived because she fought back (p.267). There was an ironic ending fro the chief investigator (Chapter 28). The psychosexual sociopath \\"looked almost human\\" (p.275). Chapter 30 tells how the media covered this.Joseph Wambaugh shows his bias in the term \\"gun-crazy country like the U.S.\\" (P.243). The small villages in the US have high gun ownership with no such murders as in this book. It can't be a coincidence. Or is it the higher rate of church membership? Journalist Per Wahloo wrote novels that used Swedish society as the background. They documented their lives and housing. Wambaugh tells little about these villages, or what people do for a living. How do they compare to others?"},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"it's about the first murder cases solved by DNA testin"},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"I did not buy this and I have no idea why I have it on my review list."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"I'm not sure of this book's niche. It is a VERY dry read taken as a thriller, yet I didn't find it to be particularly instructive. It is a book that is worth reading for anyone with particular interest in sociopathic behaviour, or the tyrannical government that our forefathers fled to America to escape. If you have no particular interest in these subjects, you may find your mind wandering while you sift through decidedly mundane details that are completely unrelated to the story. And while the book certainly does pick up speed towards the end, I found it rather unsatisfying that the author purposefully leads you off onto a number of dead ends, at great length, merely to illustrate the point that becomes clear on its own throughout the course of the book(police don't know how to deal with anything new, they just run routines). Overall you may find your time spent better with some other works in the same vein(and even by the same author), whether you're looking for an instructive view of the actual policework that goes into such a case, or just an interesting story."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"A more brutal crime than any treated by Wambaugh's distorted pen, this book details worse than ever the policeman-author's insensitivity to the victim or her family and friends. Instead, as always, the book is replete with charming one-liners over the detective work and the continuation of the case history. Genetic finger-printing, &quot;the Blooding,&quot; details the forensics of finding the true killer through DNA analysis. Meanwhile, Wambaugh has his host of private chuckles, as a policeman story-teller sharing jokes among his readership (as if the book was intended for policemen friends). A recluse in the book &quot;has been harder to reach than Marlon Brando.&quot; The amount of film used to document all aspects of the case has involved &quot;a trainload.&quot; Among the hundreds of townies analysed by the forensics procedure, Wambaugh says &quot;more English blood had been spilled than on the Somme,&quot; a WWI battle that claimed a mere million fatalities. When documentation takes such a tenor, I wonder at the truth of his other statements, and whether the true spirit of all detective work is to find the laughter in the thing.Finally, Wambaugh's own personality splits into a spokesman as well as policeman, when he makes an uncharacteristically compassionate remark that a tragedy had occurred at all. This sensitivity to an actual crime unfortunately stands alone throughout the book, as the rest of the writing provides a mocking parade of the facts."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"This was an interesting story well-told, but I really liked howWambaugh describes the sociopathic personality . Wambaugh has afascination with sociopaths, because they feel no guilt, and Wambaugh, who was raised as a Catholic, thus had guilt hammered into his head, can't comprehend feeling no guilt, so is fascinated by them. Such fascination helped makes this a good book."},{"Title":"The Blooding","review":"Joseph Wambaugh's true crime books such as THE ONION FIELD and this book easily rival his classic fiction. This describes the first case ever involving DNA evidence. We learn each of the pertinant developments in the case as the investigators do, and we are given compassionate looks at the victims and at their families. There are graphic descriptions here, although somewhat lighter than those in the goriest crime novels. Still, be warned that this is strong meat and not for the most sensitive readers. There are instances of police humor throughout the book as there always are in Wambaugh's fiction although I'm sure those here are absolute statements made off the cuff during the actual investigation. After all, police humor is one way real life officers deal with the horrors that are part of their job. Missing is the police brutality shown in some of Wambaugh's fiction.

I was struck as I read this tripe that their hatred for TR has completely colored their ability to write a fair and honest look at the famous Rough Rider. This book is useful only if you want a good laugh."},{"Title":"Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan: The Making of a President (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"The authors reexamine the &quot;Hero of San Juan Hill&quot; to find that the heroic legend was manufactured, partly by Roosevelt himself, partly by the powerful newspaper correspondents he courted, and, perhaps surprisingly, supported by the Rough Riders themselves. That Roosevelt didn't mind risking their lives in his political ambition didn't seem to bother them overmuch - they were, after all, alive and victorious, and shared the prevailing military ethos of those innocent pre-Passchendaele days, when &quot;glory&quot; was counted as a real and achievable goal.The story is well told here in this well-researched and readable work, with admirable maps by Texas A&amp;M's own Cartographic Unit. Highly recommended for the general reader of military history and Roosevelt fans, as well as others who would like to see the birth of &quot;spin&quot;.The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unwelcome feature of the page.

Appleby is left with only a confused memory of the meeting:\\"'The magenta one was anxious that the salmon-pink one should tell me some interesting anecdote.' Appleby just perceptibly hesitated. 'There was to be a railway journey in it, and a retired soldier. But the salmon-pink one rather shut the other one up.'\\"Little does Appleby know that he will encounter Miss Pringle and her mysterious retired soldier, deep in darkest Wiltshire, in a case involving blackmail, various unsavoury goings-on, and possibly even murder.All of Michael Innes' Appleby mysteries abound with eccentric (although highly literate) characters and some of the novels, such as \\"Appleby's Answer\\" tend more toward farce than bloodshed. This author takes stock characters from the British mystery genre and twists them just a bit out of true: the horse-crazy country gentry; the genteel, middle-aged authoress of shocking mysteries; and a couple of British school boys, who could have been plucked from \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"Appleby's long-suffering wife, Judith makes fun of her husband's propensity to involve himself in the criminal affairs of mere acquaintances:\\"'John's answers to such problems are invariably correct. It was a saying, as a matter of fact, at Scotland Yard.' Outrageous invention was occasionally one of Judith's amusements. '\\"Appleby's Answer,\\" they used to say. It became proverbial.'\\"Michael Innes (John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) was born in Edinburgh, educated at Oxford, and taught English in universities all over the world. His scholarly career includes works on Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad, but he is better known as the creator of Inspector John Appleby, whose exploits inspired a lasting vogue for literary (and literate) mysteries."},{"Title":"Appleby's answer, (A Red badge novel of suspense)","review":"Another brilliant mystery by Michael Innes. His characters are wildly eccentric, incredibly erudite, and bizarre beyond all imagination! In this book, a mystery author, Priscilla Pringle, and a headmaster of a boys' school, Captain Bulkington, meet. They discuss collaborating on a book...or are they really collaborating to murder Sir Ambrose? John and Judith Appleby stumble on the scene, and solve the mystery. But wait? Was there really a crime? When you read this book closely, you will realise that even that question is not readily apparent.Michael Innes is one of my favorite mystery authors. His books can be difficult to find, due to the lack of availability. Take advantage of e-shops, and buy them here. You won't be sorry. The New Sonia Wayward is the most famous, but this is as good an offering as you'll find, although my favorite so far is Hare Sitting Up."},{"Title":"Murdered in Central America: The Stories of Eleven U.S. Missionaries","review":"I have to say, this book he wrote with his wife is as informative as his lectures.While the events described in Murdered happened prior to the end of the Cold War, the story gives us pause-we really HAVE to start thinking about what our tax dollars are supporting-dictators and death squads are the same whether they are on the right or the left-to support them in the name of fighting communism or terrorism is immoral."},{"Title":"Murdered in Central America: The Stories of Eleven U.S. Missionaries","review":"I was sorely disappointed that the authors chose to use the pretext of stories about predominantly Catholic missionaries to promote their liberal bias. The Reagan bashing and Ted Kennedy praising (yes, he is a hero in this book!) demeans what should have been a tribute to eleven men and women who were unjustifiably murdered."},{"Title":"Plant Indicators Of Soils, Rocks, and Subsurface Waters","review":"The research presented here dates from the 1950's and 1960's.

I picked this one up at the Museum at Fort Sill Oklahoma a number of years ago. The title is self explanatory. This is actually a pretty dry read. It does not cover the history of use or the effects of the evolution of the pieces it describes. Technical developments and tactical considerations are covered in fair detail, but the operational use and strategic impact are for the most part left out. However, as a focused book it is interesting in and of itself. If you are an artillery officer, this should probably be on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Artillery Through the Ages, a Short Illustrated History of Cannon, Emphasizing Types Used in America.","review":"This book is generally considered the best all-round artillery reference.It's especially valuable to scratch-builders of 18th century andearlier sailing ship models, for its accurate info on cannons of thevarious periods.

However, the most disturbing one was the use of my hips during the golf swing.This book advocates using the hips as a power source. It also insinuates that using the hips is some sort of new idea. Please listen to me. I was taught this same info 15 years ago and it does not work. I was taught that as a woman, our hips are wider and in order to hit a long ball the hips must be very active in the swing. All this did was lead to me casting the club and spinning out on the downswing. Using the hips is not new theory. It is an old theory thrown away years ago. Read David leadbetter or Dave Pelz or any of golf's gurus and they will tell you this is bunk. It took me years to straighten out my timing and undo the damage that this type of teaching does.The author equates using our hips to using our womb power... Oh Please! A pro once said that it amazed them that women ever learned the golf swing with all the bunk that they are taught. This book contains that bunk.

Although women players are no doubt a decisive force within the sport, a training and development book of this kind--for women, by women--has heretofore been lacking. Ms. Steinbach's book (clearly addressed, with witty prose, by her co-author Kathlene Bissell) provides insight and tips to the female golfer that all will find relevant to the development of their (her!) own game. For all those who have wondered &quot;how does this apply to me?,&quot; please find here an irreverent yet completely honest approach to a wonderful sport with the female golfer in mind (yes, it does work differently for you! and BTW, it's OK!).

Great!"},{"Title":"Exile to Sweet Dixie: The Story of Euphemia Goldsborough, Confederate Nurse and Smuggler","review":"Exile to Sweet Dixie is based on the research of the extensive Goldsborough collection. In addition to the chapters of her diaries and the hospital books, there are sections on her life, the political and military oppression under which she risked her service as nurse and smuggler, her Provost Marshal file with the documents used as evidence in her trial, and her personal papers that concerned her war activities. There are seven appendices of war related text written by her contemporaries effected by her service. Subsequent to the death of Goldsborough's granddaughter, the collection has been divided among family members and will almost certainly never be viewed as a whole or be accessible to the public. I chose to present this material as an annotated transcript of a valuable primary source. It is the drama of one woman's horrific war experiences; that of having a dying soldier tied to her back all night, being strip searched in front of the soldiers while imprisoned, and the emotional, physical, and mental toll of nursing and exile. I trust the reader to form their own perceptions and draw from it what they deem important to their particular interests."},{"Title":"Exile to Sweet Dixie: The Story of Euphemia Goldsborough, Confederate Nurse and Smuggler","review":"I got my purchase in great condition. Better than I expected since it had been a library book. Itwas sent out and received fast."},{"Title":"God, the Mind's Desire: Reference, Reason and Christian Thinking (Cambridge Studies in Christian Doctrine)","review":"Dr. Janz, who apparently had a successful career in Christian music before becoming a professor of systematic theology, has written an eloquent and thorough survey, _God, the Mind's Desire_ (_GMD_), on the demands of rationality and transcendence in Christian theology. He uses the word \\"integrity\\" often to refer to those features of reason that make it truly reason (as opposed to a 'ruse' (Rorty, Derrida, et al.], an internalist-pragmatist instrumentality lacking true universality [Putnam], or an externalist-antisubjectivist ineluctability [Nagel]), and those features of transcendence that make it truly transcendent (as opposed to a mere limit criterion of human thought [Kant] or some positivist stricture on reason altogether [Barth]). That is a mouthful, I know, and Janz's prose does tend to clump up at times. But he is dealing with the very grounds of the human encounter of the revealed God, so it's unavoidable the trains of thought run pretty closely together.The keystone of _GMD_ is Janz's very charitable and illuminating exegesis of Kant's _Kritik der Reinen Vernunft_, followed up by a fascinating discussion of how Bonhoeffer tried to carry on the Kantian project in a feasibly Christian way, particularly in his _Akt und Sein_. Janz's key premise is that only by taking seriously the *empirical realism* of Kant, considered as a genuine *inversion* of philosophy's perennial polarities (realism/antirealism, empiricism/idealism, etc.), can we hope to escape those polarities in a way that opens up adequate space for an account of transcendence and reason. The book builds very nicely: from a discussion of postmodern antirationalism (and a rejection of it, even in the guise of \\"radical orthodoxy\\", as a total non-starter for Christian theology), to a critical analysis of realism vs. antirealism, to a great exposition of Kant, to a discussion, following Donald MacKinnon, of tragedy as a finality of nonresolution (which thus leaves us anagogically \\"open\\" to transcendence), to Janz's conclusion--namely, that the Kierkegaardian and Bonhoefferian idea of despair *of* and penultimacy in the face of the Christ-question, \\"Who are you?\\" As you can see, this book is slap-full of ideas and figures, so I can't recommend a much better way to get a handle on so many related issues in one book.Things I did not like about this book were: 1) Janz was very repetitive, 2) sometimes Janz was very repetitive, and 3) his Protestant anti-sacramentalism was really showing in his one-page dismissal of Marion's eucharistic referentialism. I also find it troubling that Janz did not really engage some of the giants of realism in recent Christian theology: T.F. Torrance, E. Gilson, J. Maritain, C. Gunton, E.L. Mascall, S. Jaki, et al. At least bring up Lonergan, if you're going to deal so much with Kantian transcendentalism as a method in Christian theology!A book that you should read along with, or, better, after this, is Donald Keefe's _Covenantal Theology_ (_CT_). It was incredible to see Keefe's thesis--which you can get a sense of in my review of _CT_ at Amazon--confirmed so unwittingly in Janz's offhanded remark that the flaw in Marion's identifying the referent of divine transcendence in the Eucharist (and its episcopal matrix), is that \\"[w]e want fundamental theological discourse...to be meaningful outside of the actual Eucharistic celebration\\" (_GMD_, p. 190). As Fr. Keefe argues in great depth, this sort of \\"want\\" is inimical to Christian integrity, seeing as it either pits the concrete worship of the Church against some supposed absolute (pagan) cosmos in which the Eucharist--Christ fully present among us--is left dangling as an irrational offense against cosmic wholeness, or (often as a result of the first action) subsumes the Church's living worship under the cosmos and, once again, reduces the Gospel to a cosmic ideality. Try as he might, I am not convinced Janz has actually escape the Kantian enclosure."},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"Cooper does what I didn't think was possible--he captures, on the page, the beauty and fluidity of dance. His exquisitely simple watercolors--and exquisitely spare prose--take us from the dancers' studio, to the neighborhood in which the dancers live, to the opening night stage. His artwork evokes rather than dictates, his prose suggests rather than explains. It's a gorgeous book. And my kids, the most important judges, loved it.Three of my four children are or were involved in dance. After reading the review for Dance in the New York Times, I bought it for my youngest for a birthday present. I quickly found myself back in the bookstore buying copies for my other children (and for my sister's kids, and the author's Baseball book for my son) for Christmas. It truly was a wonderful find, and I'd suggest it to anyone who knows kids--or adults, for that matter--with an interest in dance. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"Elisha Cooper's book Dance! is wonderful for what it says and shows but also for what it does not spell out. He shows us some of the exquisite details in the daily lives of the dancers, in the practice studios, posing and touching and relating to each other..walking on your partners back for example. But I'm pleased to say he stops before you get the big show, just when the curtain is about to go up. Now young and old a like will stretch their creative imagination to envision the performance. Almost like the good old days of radio shows when you listened carefully and visualized what was going on. Maybe Elisha Copper will someday give us Act I so we can compare it to ours. He gets better with each book."},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"Every child who ever liked to watch dance performances will love this portrayal of the work and fun that happens behind the scenes before the curtain goes up. Cooper's energetic and ethereal illustrations capture the airy movement of the dancers, and his prose is evocative and sometimes wonderfully quirky and entertaining. I disagree with the former reviewer's complaints about the illustrations, which I found charming, and productive of endless fun with children picking out specific little figures. I particularly like the tiny handwritten notes in the paintings themselves, which lend an air of spontaneity and a playful view into the mind of the artist at work, and which do not need to be clearly legible to have this effect. I also loved the ending, which I found entirely appropriate to a book so specifically about what happens on the other side of the curtain."},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"As a former dancer myself, I was astounded by how perfectly the author captured the lightness, flexibility, and movement of the dancers in this book. This book guides the adult and child reader through the backstage life of a professional dancer -- through the sweat and pain, the music and laughter, the choreography and lighting, the nerves and excitement. The swirling words, the simple colors, and the memorable observations are both entertaining and educational. Any child (or adult) who likes to dance -- or simply likes to ask questions about how things happen -- will love this book!"},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"Join author, Elisha Cooper, as he pays tribute to the marvelous world of dance. This is a unique book about the process, not the performance. Arrive at the studio and warm up with the troupe, stretching and working at the barre. Meet the choreographer and watch as he demonstrates steps and teaches the new dance, bending bodies and correcting positions &quot;as if he were molding clay.&quot; Then practice, practice, practice. &quot;The dancers rehearse until their arms and legs remember the steps.&quot; There are costumes to fit, tickets to sell, programs to print, and advertisements to write. Lights, music, and scenery need to be coordinated with the dance and dancers, and even flowers need to be bought to give to the dancers after the performance. So much to do in only four short weeks... Mr Cooper's lyrical text is filled with imagery, magic, and passion as it creatively mimics its subject and dances across the pages. His simple pencil and watercolor artwork dazzles, complementing the prose beautifully, and captivates with grace, energy, and motion. Perfect for youngsters 8-12, or as a read aloud for younger children, Dance is an evocative and exciting experience that builds with each page turn. &quot;Opening night. A crowd forms outside the theater, bustling for tickets. The dancers gather backstage. They can hear the buzz of the audience finding seats, the beating of their own hearts. They hug. The choreographer tells them they are wonderful. The lights go down. The curtain goes up.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"\\"Dance\\" by Elisha Cooper is a triumph.

I'm so glad there's such a talented young author who chose to investigate the work behind the stage in a style that was unpretentious, kid-friendly, and didn't copy Degas all over again! A light-hearted yet insightful look behind the hard work of the performance, the story's watercolor studies and verbal vignettes capture moments of sweet and bittersweet perfection.

This is the book for them, a perfect gift. The drawings are neat and evocative. The text is matter-of-fact and practical, without a touch of sentimentality, cuteseyness, or fake artiness. Yet precisely because of its cool narrative, both visually and in text, Dance! captures more of the reality of dancing, and also the excitement that arises from that sweaty reality, than any other children's book I have seen. Bravo for Dance! Sybil Schwartz, PhD"},{"Title":"Dance!","review":"Outlining what it takes to create a dance performance, from the gathering of the dancers, to the creation of the choreography, to the sewing of costumes, this book uses very visual language to convey the amount of work it takes to produce a show. With phrases such as, &quot;Their feet squeak on the floor, and it sounds as if they are scrubbing it clean,&quot; the reader can almost hear the dancers crossing the room. What the words convey, though, the illustrations do not. Although the pictures of the dancers are very fluid and expressive, they are also very small and somewhat abstract. Side comments are painted in tiny lettering next to some of the pictures that are difficult, if not impossible, to read. Worse, as the tension leading up to opening night grows with each turn of the page, the disappointment one feels when the book ends before the curtain is raised is crushing. This book is written for the child who has been to the theater and is curious about the ins-and-outs of production, but will leave the average reader feeling frustrated.

I thought that perhaps it was actually Dostoyevksy's personal diary. In fact, it is a journal Dostoyevsky wrote entirely himself and put out on a monthly basis. He muses on variety of subjects such as social-political issues of Russia at the time and criminal cases that have attracted his interest. In addition, he includes a few skeletons of short stories he is working on. Highly recommended for Dostoyevsky fanatics; newcomers would be better off reading Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"A Writer's Diary [Volume 1: 1873-1876]","review":"This book and its companion volume present the contents of a journal written, edited, and published by Dostoevsky over a period of eight years. It is a fascinating collection. There are stories; there are literary discussions; there are commentaries on current events, especially court cases and international developments. There are jaw-drop-inducing vamps on the harmful effects of the Jews on decent Christian people. As time passes and Dostoevsky grows older and sicker, most other topics are abandoned in favor of eschatological Slavophile ruminations on the &quot;Eastern Question&quot; and the coming triumph of Russian Orthodoxy. All of this will be much more than the casual reader will want to wade through. Yet for the serious student or fan of Dostoevsky's novels, the diaries provide a unique and amazing window into the author's thinking. For the student of 19th century history, they are an unforgettable presentation of one side of the passionate arguments over the future of the Balkan countries. For the student of Russian history, they provide eyewitness commentary on the struggles that accompanied the introduction of Western-style legal reforms, such as trial by jury. They are unique and amazing volumes, enhanced by a superb editor's introduction and useful endnotes."},{"Title":"A Writer's Diary [Volume 1: 1873-1876]","review":"This is a book (actually the first volume of a 2-volume set) forDostoevsky aficianados. There is some very interesting and varied material in this large volume -- essays, imaginings, journalism, polemic, short stories, propoganda, rants, etc.. A kind of 'Fyodor Unwrapped.' It helps to have read other books by this great Russian Master, particularly his 'Big 5': Crime & Punishment,The Idiot, The Devils, A Raw Youth, Brothers Karamavoz. The translation by Kenneth Lantz is excellently done; the extensive Introduction by Gary Saul Morsom, is helpful, butdefinitely 'over kill.'The book, in fact, is a microcosm of Dostoevsky himself: plenty of flaws and foolishness, but always worth plowing through. He is, after all, probably the world's greatest novelist, and I recommend this book highly to those who agree with that assessment."},{"Title":"A Writer's Diary [Volume 1: 1873-1876]","review":"All the elements of Dostoevsky's genius come through in this hodgepodge of literary forms.

They are all gone but this book helps you remember them."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"For those of us who were born during the war and cannot be considered boomers....I find myself extremely interested in the years just prior to U.S. entry into and then on to the end of the war. I am reading many books which delve into the lives and activities of people caught up in those times. This book really hits the spot. I had no idea what influence these radio broadcasts had on Americans and the beginning of broadcast news. The men featured in this book were men of courage and vision. Worth the time."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Written in lively and engrossing style, the Murrow Boys covers the salad days of Edward Murrow and his pioneering changes to war news broadcasts. Only after understanding how great a patriot and journalist Murrow was acknowledged to be in general public opinion, does it become clear how and why Murrow was able to take on Joe McCarthy virtually single-handedly. In addition, the internal politics of Bill Paley's CBS become even more riveting. So if you liked the movie, you will love the book."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"If you've read a lot of the histories of CBS News (and there are dozens) most of this will be old news. The authors synthesize the various biographies and histories into a very readable tale. What I found most interesting came from the lesser known members of the team like Larry LeSueur, Thomas Grandin, and Mary Marvin Breckinridge.Once you get out of the war, though, everything becomes very familiar, tedious ground, if you have endured Three Blind Mice, Who Killed CBS?, and any of the Gary Paul Gates door-stoppers.The authors lose their footing whenever they move away from biography and comment on war aims or strategy. One whopper is to blame the North African Campaign (Operation Torch) on Churchill's \\"underbelly of Europe obsession\\". At the time, America had just entered the War and Roosevelt needed to get into the action somewhere in Europe. The only theater open was North America. Similarly, the Italian campaign also gets the \\"underbelly of Europe\\" dismissal -- forgetting that Stalin really needed the Anglo-American Army to continue killing Germans somewhere to take some of the pressure off his front -- and the allies still didn't have enough material on hand to take Normandy. Sitting around doing nothing was not an option. We even get \\"underbelly of Europe obsession\\" for the brief foray into Greece -- a campaign that was always going to be a delaying action anyway.To sum up, if you haven't read much about Murrow before then this is a serviceable, shallow, but well written read. At $3.95 for the Kindle, a bargain."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"I bought this for my husband who was a TV news reporter for 40+ years before retiring. He loved this book. He felt it showed perfectly how and perhaps why the news business has gone from a high-standard public service to what is essentially entertainment. If this is a subject that interests you ... if you have ever asked the question \\"Whatever happened to real news?\\", then this book is a MUST read. Very well written, too."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"The news we receive over television now has for the most part has lost its impact and meaning. What we get is void of any background, color, or substance to make an impact in our lives. Much of the news on television is not on important world stories but on celebrities or entertainment. News has been significantly watered down since Ed Murrow and his boys first started reporting it through the new medium of radio at the onset of World War II in the late 1930's.The technology back then was in its beginning and often didn't work. These men never knew if the words they spoke over the air were even getting through. But that didn't stop them from the urgency of their jobs to get what they knew concerning Hitler and the war in Europe on the air, trying to light a fire under a complacent American public back home, so that we would become involved in helping to save the world from ruin. Murrow was a genius at encouraging young men and women occasionally (which was amazing at that time) to learn to see beneath just the surface of what was happening and look at how for example the war was impacting people on a daily basis in London, as far as being able to get food, clothing, and other basic needs. This in turn made the war more 'real' to Americans, and helped to bring America into the war (especially to send things that were needed prior to Pearl Harbor over to England).Murrow and each of these men had their own problems and quirks, but most of them remained strongly attached to one another and to their idea of good journalism through the advent of television. They had to struggle against advertisers and bosses at CBS who wanted to dilute their 'product' and turn it into the lesser entertainment into which news has now become for the most part (except in cases like 60 minutes and some channels devoted just to news now). This book is a phenomenal read...lots of good and detailed information. It includes some printed excerpts of the on-air news reports, but I would have liked more (I know you can get copies of these now, but I'm deaf and cannot hear them...).

Interesting to see what went on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; with some of the most famous (and not familar) names in broadcast journalism. Not a boring chapter in the book!"},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"The names Murrow, Sevareid, Collingwood, and Shirer have created standards that have been forgotten. Thought has been replaced by good looks. Read this book to see how CBS News became a news operation of mythic proportion with brilliant, yet terribly troubled men creating such high standards that have become forgotten. (You'll see no one on your local five pm television news here.) For these men, the importance was in writing, not pictures. You'll also see how these legendary men were racked with insecurities and self-torture. It's also uncanny in terms of how each had a rise and fall at CBS. Sadly, it's all true. The authors didn't need to resort to poetic license. (Read other accounts of these figures and you'll learn that.) When you're done with this book, you'll wish Howard K. Smith or Robert Trout were still on television today. You'll wish that instead of having happy talk on the news, you had thoughful, intelligent people who respected their audience doing reports that provoked the viewer's intellect and not pander to him. Read how Howard K. Smith was fired from CBS, what prompted it way back then, and realize the standards have been steadily declining since then on all networks. It's an enjoyable, easy-to-read book that describes the creation and erosion of impeccable standards."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"This look at the \\"Boys\\" who covered World War II for CBS radio is quite moving. I liked reading of Ed Murrow's battles with the CBS brass, and the portraits of William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Larry LeSueur, Myra Breckenridge (the Murrow \\"Girl\\"), Charles Collingwood, etc. How odd that such talented journalists were often wracked by jealousy and self-doubt. How predictable that CBS eventually dumped most of the Boys - along with their high standards - after the advent of television. By forsaking such talent, CBS helped usher in the image-conscious, bleeds-it-leads mediocrity of today's news. Fortunately, Howard K. Smith, Shirer, Sevareid and several others left a rich legacy in books and memoirs, and at this writing one can still hear Richard C. Hottelet report for National Public Radio (NPR). This book should be required reading for all journalists and corporate news executives."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"What combination of forces put Murrow and \\"the boys\\" at the forefront of creating the style and format of the network news that is part of our daily lives? \\"The Murrow Boys : Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism\\" by Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson appears to promise an answer to the question. While the book is well written, exhaustively researched, and filled with anecdotes, Cloud and Olson fail to deliver any new insight. After an introduction which sets the background, the authors structure the book around one-chapter biographies of the newsmen, often succombing to the temptation of wandering off into the byroads of celebrity biography, losing overall focus. In many cases, such as the commentary on Howard K. Smith, the biography presented here pales before the honest, understated drama and insight offered by the subjects in their own autobiographies--as in the case of Smith's totally riveting \\"Events Leading to My Death.\\" And when the last mini-biography has been recounted, the book ends. I'm reminded of Snoopy writing his novel and saying \\"In Part 2 I tie all this together.\\" Except the writers never tie it all together. Thus, it is an well done book, and for those unfamiliar with the biographies of the players, it will be an interesting book. When one considers the historical information to which the authors had access, the book could have been so much more. None of the newsmen celebrated in this book would have closed the broadcast without cogent commentary into the meaning of these facts and anecdotes before closing with \\"Good Night and Good luck.\\""},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"A fascinating look at the men at the front lines of the emergence of television journalism. The writers sweep you up in the enthusiasm of men like Ed Murrow, Eric Sevareid, and Howard K.

A real eye-opener if you still believe that TV news is impartial or gives you anywhere near the whole story, and a sad reminder of what once was and will never be. Every chapter and character is intriguing, so dig in!"},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson's THE MURROW BOYS is very well researched and sourced. The writing is lively, and propels the reader happily forward. In this book, Cloud and Olson treat a fascinating and important subject that is largely forgotten in the contemporary world of news-as-entertainment.Edward R. Murrow had drawn together an erudite, talented group of thinkers and writers to form the first cadre of broadcast journalists. His crack team of radio reporters covered the tragedy and triumphs of what became known as World War II, in a way both immediate and personal, both intimate and emblematic, and above all literate. Occasionally, television journalism rises above popular tastes and pretty talking heads to inform and move the viewer on truly critical issues of the day, but never with the consistency and depth of insight of the Murrow Boys.The Murrow Boys, however, by and large shared a weakness with their later television counterparts: they were vain and egotistical, in short, \\"stars.\\" Cloud and Olsen, aside from skillfully explaining the revolution in mass communications that radio journalism was, devote quite a bit of their book to the celebrity status of these prima donnas. This underscores the Murrow Boys' ultimate self-deception and hypocrisy: while they railed at the shallowness of television news production, programming, and personalities, they positioned themselves--each one out for himself--to grab as much limelight as possible. Ultimately, celebrity triumphed over journalistic integrity.Thus THE MURROW BOYs does come off as a fast-paced celebrity biography. As a celebrity biography, it is very successful: it is engaging and sophisticated. From that perspective, one might well treat it as one does an intelligent \\"beach read\\": light, entertaining reading that one does not have to hide.However that may be, the book gives one an appreciation for the significance of the Murrow Boys. Too bad, though, that the authors did not choose to include more text from the reporting of the Murrow Boys; that would have given the reader a greater appreciation of their eloquence. Better yet, a CD with some of these broadcasts would have made a nice accompaniment.And too bad that the authors did not choose to go beyond the Murrow Boys' celebrity to explain the impact of their reporting on the American public as well as how they may have helped to shape history. As an example of the misplaced priorities of the writers: There is an instance described late in the book about how Charles Collingwood was invited to North Vietnam in 1968 and how his reporting from Hanoi helped lead to the peace talks. This half-page is then followed up with three pages on the relationship between Collingwood and his wife, Rita, at this time.Despite these limitations, the book is still fun and informative. And it really ought to read as a reminder of the tremendous service delivered by Murrow's proud pioneers of the airwaves."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"One of the most hallowed names in the history of broadcast journalism is that of Edward R. Murrow whose tenure at CBS News ran from 1935 to 1961. His reputation is legendary ranging from fearlessly covering the London Blitz on rooftops while Nazi bombs rained around him during the Battle of Britain to taking on and helping bring down Communist witch hunter Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950's. While there have been several noteworthy biographies of the gentleman less attention has been paid to the staff of foreign correspondents he put together prior to and during World War II that set the standard for broadcasting excellence. \\"The Murrow Boys\\" a meticulously researched and fascinating tome remedies this situation.The original group alphabetically was the following one woman and ten men: Mary Marvin Breckinridge, Cecil Brown, Winston Burdett, Charles Collingwood, William Downs, Thomas Grandin, Richard C. Hottelet, Larry LeSueur, Eric Sevareid, William L. Shirer, and Howard K. Smith. The beginning was in 1937, when Edward R. Murrow, fledgling director of shows in Europe for CBS radio recruited fellow American foreign correspondent William L. Shirer. Together they would make broadcast history and revolutionize how war news would be reported when Hitler invaded and took over neighboring Austria in the March 1938 Anschluss. In just eight hours Murrow in Vienna and Shirer in London pulled together the first news \\"roundup\\" a thirty minute radio broadcast on the European reaction to the Anschluss, Shirer and a member of Parliament spoke from London, Murrow from Vienna and also American journalists in Paris, Berlin and Rome. After this triumphant accomplishment, when a bone weary Shirer and Murrow reunited at a bar in Vienna, Murrow told Shirer \\"Maybe now, my friend, we can go places.\\" Indeed they did, and radio news broadcasting would truly come into its own with their assistance.As the horizon darkened on the European continent in spring/summer of 1939 and war seemed inevitable, Murrow continued to add new recruits to his team. Thomas Grandin and Eric Sevareid both based in Paris were the next to be hired. He had an unerring eye for nascent talent, and in the course of the next two years would assemble a dream team of the best and brightest in broadcast journalism. The team was a triple threat; they got the news, wrote their own copy, and reported it live on the radio. They were on a whole well educated, erudite, idealistic, mainly of a liberal slant and although some of them did not have the most resonant voices, their writing and analysis were first rate. These were young correspondents in their twenties and thirties, with the drive, recklessness and stamina to get the story, and considering the chances they took, led charmed lives. But oh the stories they covered: Eric Sevaraid breaking the news of the fall of France to Germany, Bill Shirer's exclusive of the humiliating armistice of the French to the Germans, Larry LeSueur hitting Utah Beach in the second wave on D-Day, Richard C. Hotteltot being first to report on the Battle of the Bulge among others!Inevitably fame and acclaim would come to many, particularly Murrow, Shirer, Sevareid, Collingwood and Smith. Bestsellers would be published, they would be lionized by society and their celebrity would seduce some of them. But in the postwar world would come disillusionment with the changing role of the journalist and the media. Radio was starting to recede as television came in, the lofty ideals of wartime replaced particularly by CBS Chairman William Paley with a cautious conservatism as the specter of McCarthyism gained power, coupled with the urge to drive CBS profits higher at whatever the cost. Three significant casualties to this would be Murrow, Shirer and Smith. Others would deal with failed marriages, infidelities, alcoholism, bitterness and ruined health; Edward R. Murrow, \\"the Boys\\" idol and mentor, would succumb to lung cancer at just fifty-seven years of age, a casualty of his trademark ever-present cigarette. Finally as they aged, the world would pass them by, as time does with us all. Reading this engrossing, at times cautionary tale, the above quote from Shakespeare's play \\"Cymbeline\\" seemed an appropriate title to this review.One particular aspect I found intriguing was the role of women in this particular sphere of influence and how much times changed for the better. One woman Murrow was able to hire Mary Marvin Breckinridge did sterling work covering the Nazi invasion of the Low Countries in spring 1940. Yet when she got married later on same year, it was expected she would retire gracefully, which she did, it was her choice, but if she hadn't she would have been replaced. However another excellent American woman stringer reporter in Norway at the same time Betty Wason was not able to continue her position due to female prejudice and was told by New York Headquarters to find a male replacement, she had to yield to Winston Burdett. Several of the wives were extraordinary women as well, equal in bravery to their more celebrated husbands. Tess Shirer gave birth to their daughter in Vienna at the height of the Anschluss, nearly dying of complications, her Jewish doctor fleeing, Nazi goons prowling the hospital corridors; afterwards in Geneva she ran a small news bureau for Shirer while he remained in Berlin. Lois Sevareid, had a similar situation when she gave birth to twin boys shortly before France fell, left alone in a clinic in Neuilly, while the nurses and patients fled the Nazi advance. Rescued by Sevareid, she was soon on her way back alone to the USA with two infants through submarine infested waters. Later in the war, she moved to Cairo as a trained lawyer to work for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Janet Murrow, endured both the fury of London Blitz and her husband's late wartime affair with the notorious Pamela Churchill with courage and fortitude. Yet these women for all their intelligence and talent were expected to take and be content with a second place status. Oh yes, certainly was a different world!Co-authors Stanley Cloud former Washington Bureau Chief for \\"Time\\", and his wife Lynne Olson correspondent for AP & \\"Baltimore Sun\\", journalistic experience gives this biography added dimension and depth. Their style is excellent and this work is very fair and balanced, Murrow and his associates are portrayed honestly yet not salaciously, warts and all. They also show the shift and decline of the broadcast news over the years, where flashy style takes precedence over substance, since the networks can coin bigger bucks that way. I'd recommend this to anyone who's interested in how television news declined to the nadir of the Fox News Network. There is indeed irony that most of the analysis of the news these days is coming laden with heavy doses of satire and sarcasm on \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\", both spoofs of evening news shows on \\"Comedy Central\\"."},{"Title":"The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism","review":"The Murrow Boys, Pioneers On The Front Lines of Journalism, Stanley Cloud & Lynne Olson; Houghton Mifflin Co.

It is more lies and myths than truth.There is a huge difference betwen game management and wildlife management though the author uese the term interchangably. The former is about sport hunting and producing as many trophies and live targets for \\"sportsmen\\" as possible. The latter is about working hand in hand with, not against nature to maintain the natural order in a world dominated by humans.This book is meant to be a propagandist handbook for hunters which will work so long as the audience is either fellow hunters or an ignorant, gullible, brain dead non hunting public.To anyone with even a psssing understanding of the differenecs between game and wildlife managemnt it is a great tool for making the case against trophy hunting and the common practice of allowing hunters to own and operate our public agencies which are entrusted to manage our wildlife with our tax dollars."},{"Title":"Redefining the 'Self': Selected Essays on Swift, Poe, Pinter, and Joyce","review":"The essays in this volume examine the conflict of \`self' in society as a leitmotif in Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher, Pinter's The Dwarfs, The Lover, The Caretaker, and The Homecoming, and Joyce's great modern classic, Ulysses. In his analysis, Murray discusses the ideas of behavioral and ideological conformity in Swift's work. He examines Poe's use of the grotesque to suggest correlations between the moral, physical, and spiritual degeneration of the characters, and the natural decay of their environment. Murray analyzes Pinter's dramas and suggests how the characters within the plays use language to create spatial boundaries to make themselves impervious to the language of their \`social others.' Murray's final essay concentrates on the use of role-playing and misidentification in Joyce's novel. Murray brilliantly bridges the generations and synergizes some of the most influential works of literature within his critical study. New readers and nonspecialists will find his essays to be accessible and well researched. Scholars and advanced students will appreciate his analyses of recent developments in literary theory. Murray presents a work that is at once authoritative, scholarly, and stimulating."},{"Title":"Purrles of Feline Wisdom","review":"This book has a color photo on one page with a phrase under it and on the facing page it has a paragraph.

Because his oeuvre - which included an enormous range of styles in painting, sculpture and etching - is so vast and important for the development of modern art, it is very difficult to cover in such a modest tome as this one. That said, the careful selection of works, the cross-referencing and the clear text all make this an ideal choice for a reader who does not want to be bogged down in masses of detail. Picasso was such an important artist that appreciation of his work should not be the exclusive domain of academics and art critics. For all those who agree with me, this book is ideal."},{"Title":"Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation","review":"What has always turned me off about debunkers and &quot;professional skeptics&quot; is the low, (very low), road they often take of ridicule, snobbery and an almost Evangelical Skepticism. Then there is this wonderful book by Nicholas Humphrey. Where other would-be Rationalists fail, Humphrey succeeds. He lays out for us elegantly, reasonably, sanely and with humour and compassion, the Materialist case; pointing out more succintly than anyone else I've read the flaws, not only in the logic of &quot;Paranormalists&quot;, but many of the logical flaws &quot;debunkers&quot; fall into. The style of the book is relaxed and conversational, honest and straightforward and enjoyable. Sane medicine for the intellect. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation","review":"There are now, thankfully, a number of very good books debunking paranormal beliefs (Shermer's Why People Believe Weird Things, Sagan's Demon Haunted World, for example). Most provide a devasting critique of those beliefs and almost all approach belief in the paranormal in a similiar manner. Humphrey provides some new arguments and insights and hence, Leaps of Faith serves as both a great introduction to skeptical literature and as a source of new insight for people who have already sorted through most of the traditional arguments against the existence of supernatural forces in our daily life.Humphrey's 'Argument from Unwarranted Design' turns out to be an incredible analytical tool and he uses it compellingly in a number of contexts. While most author's content themselves with trotting out the litany of scientific disproofs of the supernatural, Humphrey raises logical objections to alleged paranormal phenomena. Why should strange little phenonoma such as spoon bending bother to exist at all? How and why would they have been created in contravention to the rules of science and the dictates of normally parsimonious design? In short, Humphrey makes a strong case that the supernatural is both empirically AND logically unlikely.One more thing, Humphrey has a very readable style. If the concepts sound complicated and off-putting, they become vivid and immediate as Humphrey gives simple examples and compelling illustrations. Wonderful to read!Buy the book!"},{"Title":"Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation","review":"Humphrey's book has two major virtues that every book should have: it is very entertaining (in an intelligent way), and it actually manages to make a couple of novel points, which is more than can be said for a lot of contemporary publishing... The topic of &quot;Leaps of faith&quot; is what seems to be the eternal (but is in fact only about a couple of centuries old) battle between science and myth. Where &quot;myth&quot; includes the paranormal and in general, explanations of the world around us that are non-naturalistic, or transcendental. Telepathy, psychokinesis, ghosts, and the power of prayer are all under fire in this fascinating compendium of skepticism and logic. But, Humphrey criticizes the usual ways in which scientists have defended their skeptical position, such as directly challenging people like Uri Geller (the infamous &quot;spoon-and-fork-bender&quot;). The author explains that some courageous approaches to the rebuttal of the paranormal may be dangerous and ineffective. For example, the notorious magician James Randi has for years challenged people to bring forth claims of paranormal phenomena. Randi offers a prize if he cannot repeat by perfectly normal means the supposedly supernatural feat. However, Humphrey points out that there are two flaws in this strategy. First, just because James Randi (or whomever) can imitate a phenomenon by normal means, that does not automatically prove that the phenomenon itself is not genuinely paranormal. Second, what if some day the good Randi is actually unable to duplicate a supposedly paranormal phenomenon? Does para-Randi imply para-normal? Of course not, but since it is possible - indeed likely - that Randi's abilities are limited, his strategy might dramatically and embarassingly backfire one of these days... What's the alternative? What the author refers to as the &quot;argument from unwarranted design&quot;. It works quite simply and convincingly. Humphrey asks what are the circumstances surrounding the manifestation of paranormal phenomena, regardless of what specific phenomenon (telepathy, psychokinesis, miracles, or what have you) has allegedly occurred. There is no a priori reason why these circumstances should not be as varied as the human beings, times, and countries in which they purportedly happen. But upon even a superficial scrutiny, we do not find anything like a random background. Somehow, paranormal phenomena always manage to occur under circumstances that can be quite reasonably defined as &quot;suspicious&quot;. Either there is only one witness, or they can never be repeated in front of an investigator, or their physical evidence somehow disappears without leaving a trace. Indeed, even parapsycologists recognize this, and have elevated it to a &quot;principle&quot;, which states that for whatever reason, the presence of an investigator, or of circumstances leading to repeatability (the cornerstone of scientific investigation), somehow &quot;depress&quot; the likelihood of the paranormal phenomenon actually happening. Now, would you by a car if the salesman insists that the car will start only when he is present? But Humphrey goes even beyond the unwarranted design argument, twisting around an old favorite of mystic-oriented people. The usual tenet of many religious people and believers in the paranormal is that &quot;the world wouldn't make sense without it&quot; (where &quot;it&quot; is some sort of supernatural or transcendental power). Actually, the author of &quot;Leaps of faith&quot; argues, it is quite the opposite. If indeed the soul existed, if there really were a way to maintain your personal self forever, if you could bypass the laws of physics and read people minds or move objects without touching them, the whole fabric of the universe would simply be torn apart! Why live a meaningful life on Earth, if you know that it is only an irrelevant and astonishingly brief moment in your &quot;true&quot; existence? Could you really stand the idea that every single thought you think, no matter how remote in your subconscious, can be public knowledge by a simple act of will on someone else's part? And what would be the meaning of the laws regulating the universe, if they could be broken at any given occasion? Would you really like to take the chance every time you walk out of the front door that the law of gravity might have been temporarily suspended ?

If you own this one you do not need *Leaps of Faith*, better look for *The Inner Eye*."},{"Title":"Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation","review":"The chapter title above perfectly synopsizes Humphrey's aim in writing this book. A long-time scholar of &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena, he is well suited to examine and explain the foundations for belief in the irrational. A skeptical critic and insightful observer, he brings many years of experience to present this assessment of the &quot;paranormal&quot;. He is anxious to dispel the emotional delusions of supposedly extrasensory experiences. Such events must not overwhelm reason, he argues. In this well-written and researched book, Humphrey examines how science has addressed and answered many questions over the centuries.Religions and quasi-religions, he contends, are nurturing and explanatory medicinal packages for &quot;orphaned minds&quot;. Seeking consolation, distressed people will cling to such weak reeds with desperate intensity. Attempts to assert rationality over many years have been repulsed or constrained by those who had easy answers to probing questions. The easy answer has always been found outside the realm of nature - the &quot;super&quot;-natural. While these answers are nearly universal, Humphrey focusses on Western European traditions and illusions. Of these, naturally, it is the Christ story which claims his attention.Humphrey's handling of the Messiah phenomenon is unique. Jesus, instead of a &quot;redeemer&quot;, is portrayed as a skillful conjurer from a young age. Using modern child prodigies as models, Humphrey suggests that Jesus, too, exhibited extraordinary talents in childhood. These need not have been &quot;supernatural&quot;, but they certainly garnered attention. Following the example of a father-son mutually reinforcing alliance to perform &quot;spoon-bending&quot; feats, he suggests Jesus was the victim of a &quot;virtuous circle&quot; of family and friends encouraging him. While those in his home town remained skeptical, Jesus' talents in sleight-of-hand were applauded elsewhere. The acclaim grew widespread enough that even non-Christian paranormal practitioners rely on the model Jesus established. It's a compelling idea, both in accepting an historical Jesus while explaining how supposedly irrational events can gain wide-spread acceptance.Readers are well-served by Humphrey's efforts to shunt the paranormal aside and replace it with analytical considerations of miracles, &quot;psychic&quot; phenomena and charlatanry. These habits are too easily ingrained into common thinking simply because they fulfill a desire to envision a future. Science, according to Humphrey, has failed to address the paranormal so as not to give it the credibility of attention. Perhaps a full-scale campaign, he contends, would dispel the myths and leave the gullible public in a more enlightened state.

The focus of the book is primarily on logic -- refuting such beliefs through a systematic, logical approach to understanding the universe -- and does not focus much on specifics; it's a very short book and personally I would have liked more detail, but I guess that wasn't the author's approach, and he's pretty good at what he does focus on. He also refrains (for the most part) from the mocking approach and from belittling the believers - which might be entertaining and deserved to us skeptics, but serves little real purpose. He rapidly tears through such phenomena as psycho/telekenesis, ghosts, various kinds of magic and illusion and ESP, giving hard facts as to why the existence of such things/phenomena is, at best, highly unlikely.My favorite part was something totally new to me -- how Jesus can be seen to figure into a long line of middle eastern magicians and charlatans, and how the concept that he was \\"preordained\\" as the Messiah could in fact have created the belief in him, and helped him in his supposed \\"miracles\\".

Quite understandable people would think I had lost my marbles, as I think that would be my view, even now, after experiencing visions (oh, by the way, I am and was happy and sane, not drunk, drugged, etc at the time).

The author's speculation on the historical Jesus while interesting is no more provable than any of the assertions by many others over the years.More significant however is the assertion that he and many other secular humanists make that one should just enjoy the life you have and live it to the fullest.

Simply wonderful. For those who deny themselves the pleasure of working through the whole book I will indicate here some particularly cute things. First, a synthetic proof of the invariance of the cross-ratio. As we all know, the sine proof is everywhere these days. I blame Courant & Robbins. One can also come across a messy proof based of Menelaus's theorem. Here now is a clean synthetic proof. Consider four rays OA, OB, OC, OD cut by a line ABCD. We wish to show that the cross-ratio (AB/CB)/(AD/CD) is the same for any other line cutting the four rays. Draw the parallel to OD through B, meeting OA in a and OC in b. Then AB/AD=aB/DO (ABa similar to ADO) and CD/CB=DO/Bb (bCB similar to OCD), so the cross-ratio (AB/CB)/(AD/CD)=AB*CD/AD*CB becomes aB/bB, which stays the same for any position of the line ab parallel to OD (ratio of distances is invariant under scaling), and the theorem follows. Now, a marvellous application of the cross-ratio is the proof of Pascal's theorem, and this of course leads us to polar theory, since we are itching to dualise Pascal to get Brianchon. The polished, modern way of doing this is by \\"linguistic dualisation\\" line&lt;->point. The classical Desargues-Poncelet way is polar reciprocation with respect to a conic. But Brianchon was not familiar with polar theory so he essentially had to create the aspects of polar theory that he needed; we of course study his proof in full in the historical notes, apart from the two proofs already given in the text. The polar theory way of looking at the situation is the following. We start with Pascal's theorem, i.e. we have a hexagon inscribed in a conic. When we apply polar reciprocation, the conic goes to a conic because through any point off the conic there are two tangents to it, and they go to two collinear points on the new curve, so the new curve has degree two, so it is a conic. And the vertices of the hexagon, being points of the conic, goes to tangents to the new conic, and thus the hexagon goes to a circumscribed hexagon, and the sides of the original hexagon goes to the vertices of the new, and the line where extensions of opposite sides met goes to the point where lines connecting opposite vertices meet."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":". . . and young readers will be eager to discover how a 13 year old was influenced by lions four generations ago. Rachel grew up in British East Africa (today's Kenya), daughter of missionaries. Her father made the bricks that formed his hospital, an under-funded mission where he also 'filled the pulpit' on Sundays. Her mother taught the Masai and Kikuyu natives, and they all learned from each other.The Africa in which Rachel Sheridan was born was filled with light and the wild beauty of the grasslands. The lessons of life she absorbed were starkly different from those learned today.During the post WW I year of 1919, the scourge of influenza still circled the Earth, and millions of people became victims. Rachel was orphaned, and became the prey of a British couple whose daughter had died. They swiftly schemed to turn Rachel into Valerie Pritchard who could then be sent back to England to work her way into the grandfather's good graces. Mr. & Mrs. P. lost no time in making that happen, leaving Rachel no time to grieve. Rachel, now Valerie, leaves behind the only home she has known and the faithful, sensitive family servant, Kanoro. She will remember the lessons of the lions: gathering strength for the time it will be needed, patience and perseverance.Author Gloria Whelan paints landscapes to entice young readers: the exotic animals of East Africa, the abundant flora and birds there & in England. Whalen draws from Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne, the 1789 classic revered by all nature lovers, and from a contemporary source about birds of Kenya. The birds have their own colorful place in this story so greatly enriched by the author's research.This is no tame story. It is sort of a \\"Sara Crewe\\" look-alike, but shows Rachel-Valerie in widely diverse situations. Growing into adulthood she answers the challenge of Kanoro to return to the \\"brightness\\" of Africa. This is an old-fashioned story with its components of exotic settings, secrets, and a rich grandparent. But it isn't tame; courage is demonstrated in different ways, and values emerge as positive elements of the tale. Don't miss Paula Jolin's review (teenreads) for an important perspective on changes from colonialism to now, and her warm appreciation of the elderly Pritchard's relationship with 'his granddaughter' as it is developed by the author.Gloria Whalen must also be saluted as someone who champions women's rights and the reading of good literature. Reviewer mcHaiku feels those moments contribute a memorable \\"brightness\\" to \\"Listening for Lions.\\" Wouldn't this be a cool novel to read aloud to 4th and/or 5th graders?"},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"I read LISTENING FOR LIONS, Gloria Whelan's 38th book, as a read-aloud to my fourth graders from the newly released galley of the book (I wrote this review on April 8, but Amazon wasn't taking reviews for it at that point). While I am not usually wild about books without much \\"action,\\" my students and I were really hooked into this book, due to Whelan's character development and interplay. The book was (as many of Whelan's books are) great at illustrating for students the use of symbolism in writing (see also Whelan's HOMELESS BIRD and MIRANDA'S LAST STAND, among others, for examples of symbolism that students can grasp). At the end of the book, my students even broke into spontaneous applause!While some of Whelan's recent books (i.e., CHU JU'S HOUSE and ST. PETERSBURG #3 / BURYING THE SUN) were starting to sound the same, LISTENING FOR LIONS seemed much fresher in comparison. Nevertheless, many of the same story elements are here as in Whelan's other recent novels:A strong heroine in an international setting loses her loving family and goes on a long, harrowing journey. At some point, she falls under the control of a villainous character (or duo) who tries to make her believe they are looking out for her best interests (out of pity) while they are actually taking advantage of her and her situation for their own gain while they belittle her and keep her down. Eventually she breaks free of their domination, stands on her own, and makes new bonds with new friends / family who truly care about her, and gains the means to provide for herself with a bright future. There is some variation of this story arc in her recent books, but while all of Whelan's books are great if taken on their own, readers of several of her recent works (most of her longer books since HOMELESS BIRD) may feel they are reading a slight rehash of others. For this reason, I can only give the book a 4 instead of a 5 - if I was a new reader of Whelan's books, this would be a definite 5.While I have enjoyed all of Whelan's children's books (I still haven't read the three adult books - they're finally getting close to the top of my reading shelves), my favorite Whelan books would be HOMELESS BIRD (National Book Award winner), FRUITLANDS, THE WANIGAN, GOODBYE VIETNAM, MIRANDA'S LAST STAND, HANNAH, the \\"Mackinac Island Trilogy,\\" LISTENING FOR LIONS, and the rare but wonderful picture book BRINGING THE FARMHOUSE HOME.Whelan says she has several more upcoming books in the works - THE TURNING (the 4th and final St. Petersburg book, due in January '06), THE SUMMER OF THE WAR (due in summer of '06), and (in '07) two more picture books for Sleeping Bear Press, one for the 50th anniversary of the Mackinac Bridge and the other set in Mali, West Africa. Whelan also pointed out to me that the jacket illustrator of Listening for Lions is the same illustrator who did the Lemony Snicket books - who would've guessed?Anyway, for \\"contemplative\\" students who don't need a huge amount of action in their reading, it's hard to go wrong with Whelan's books - her excellent quality is consistent.Dwight BlubaughNorthwestern Elem.Eaton Rapids, MI"},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"Rachel Sheridan was born and raised in British East Africa, the daughter of British missionary parents who ran a hospital there. Africa is the only home Rachel has ever known, and she loves it. But everything changes in 1919, when Rachel is thirteen. An influenza epidemic arrives and takes the lives of her parents. Because her parents were orphans, Rachel has no family to turn to, and is caught up in the devious plans of their wealthy neighbors, the Pritchards.The Pritchards lost their daughter Valerie, who was Rachel's age, in the epidemic. Valerie was about to leave to visit her grandfather in England, and the Pritchards force Rachel to impersonate Valerie and take her place. They hope Rachel will win the grandfather's heart and persuade him to leave his estate and money to the Pritchards. Rachel is devastated to leave her beloved Africa and travel to cold, lonely England. She finds herself coming to care for her \\"Grandfather,\\" but hates living a lie, and fears the Pritchards will someday follow her to England. At the same time, she is determined to find a way to return to Africa and reopen her parents' hospital.Listening for Lions is another excellent historical novel by Gloria Whelan, who is one of my favorite authors. Rachel was a very likable and determined character, and I loved the unique storyline and historical setting -- the author brought the African and British settings to life. I recommend this book to all readers who enjoyed previous books by Gloria Whelan or who love historical fiction."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"I really, really wanted to like Listening for Lions. The cover is beautiful, the title intriguing, and the plot sounded creative and full of possibility.Unfortunately, I found the book to be tedious, the characters muddy and one-dimensional, and the actual story fell far short of my expectations.The villains in this book truly are--greedy, scheming, hateful people who are furious about having been \\"exiled\\" to Africa. They're lazy, cruel, and have not a spark of humanity. (I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but there are several instances when they could have shown glimmers of being real people, but didn't.)Part of this one-dimensionality is a part of the first person voice (meaning it's hard to write in the first person and illuminate all the characters' motives), but it seems intentional here, and I think its a shortcoming.The grandfather Rachel goes to live with isn't particular developed, either, nor is his staff, or really, anyone Rachel meets along the way.The lack of character development might have been okay had Rachel been a more sympathetic character. Instead, she's wracked with guilt over the situation she finds herself in (that she really couldn't have done anything to change), homesick, and generally pretty whiny. I get the impression we're supposed to see her as heroic, a great storyteller with a plucky spirit, but instead, she seems pretty mousy to me, managing to make even a leopard attack seem sort of every day.What redeems this book is the clarity of setting. The scenes in Africa are beautifully described and it's easy to picture yourself there in a completely different time. The scenes in England are similarly beautiful, and I liked that the author didn't seem to give extra care to writing one or the other. In fact, she did a really lovely job of imbuing Africa with an obvious sense of being Rachel's home without diminishing the English setting.I'm not sorry I read it, it's a quick read, and of historical interest, but it could have been so much more, and I am disappointed in the end result. For the setting, I think it's worth the 3 stars and the time to read it, but it's definitely not a book I'll be keeping in my collection. This one's getting donated to the library."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"My mom grabbed this off the shelf for me as we werer leaving the libary. I didn't think it was going go to be as good as it was. It was interesting, to learn about Africa, and you cheer along Rachel as she tries to go back there. (Her parents owned a missionary-but died). The plot is interesting, but there seems to be no climax. It's a very unique story, although, you can predict fairly easily what the end of the story will be. Overall i thought this book was very satisfing."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"LISTENING FOR LIONS, the latest novel by National Book Award winner Gloria Whelan, is the story of Rachel Sheridan, the daughter of English missionaries working with the Kikuyu people in the East African village of Tumaini. Although Rachel is raised in humble surroundings --- a mud brick house with a roof that leaks --- she is happy, helping her father in the hospital and visiting the local people in their shambas. When the influenza epidemic of 1919 reaches Tumaini, however, Rachel's whole life changes. Not only do the Africans flee the village out of fear of the illness, but her own parents are struck down by the disease.Left without family, Rachel thinks her only option is to approach the mission board in Mombasa, although she knows they will send her to a dismal orphanage in England. Her snooty British neighbors have other ideas. Their only daughter Valerie, scheduled for a visit to England with her estranged --- and wealthy --- grandfather, also died in the flu epidemic. Valerie's parents want Rachel to take her place. \\"It is only the expectation of Valerie's visit that has kept the dear old man alive,\\" her mother claims. Rachel is astute enough to realize that there may be an underlying motive, but she's also frightened at the prospect of being trapped in the orphanage. With misgivings and a trembling heart, Rachel agrees to do as her neighbors ask, and sets off for England.LISTENING FOR LIONS is written in a spare, elegant prose that will engage adults and children alike. What could have been a trite undercover identity plot is revealed in such depth and nuance that it never becomes melodramatic or overwhelming. However, Whelan's strength here is her characters, particularly Rachel. Although in some places Rachel seems almost too good to be true, her own self-doubt and recognition of her own weaknesses make her very believable. Whelan's slow, subtle and delightful development of the relationship between Rachel and Valerie's grandfather is masterful. While Rachel grows and changes in England in some unexpected and surprising ways, she never loses the core of that missionary child growing up in the African countryside.Another thing that Whelan does extremely well is to create a sympathetic yet realistic Western character in a colonial environment. The world has changed tremendously since 1919, and behavior and attitudes that were normal at that time are often morally repugnant to us today. Most authors of historical novels deal with this by giving their main characters 21st century sensibilities, particularly on sensitive topics like women's issues and racial equality. While understandable, it has the effect of making the characters seem unreal. Whelan avoids this trap. Growing up under such unusual circumstances, Rachel's views on controversial topics seem natural, not just something tacked on to make the character more sympathetic.LISTENING FOR LIONS is a fantastic book, filled with characters who will remain with you long after you've finished the last page. I heartily recommend it.--- Reviewed by Paula Jolin"},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"Maybe it's me, but I seem to be less enamored of this book than other reviewers. It's not a dud by any means, but there are problems with this book that makes me reconsider whether I should have my students read it or not.I hate to start with constructive criticisms (or negative aspects, if you prefer), but I think the positives have been clearly identified by the other reviews posted here. Nevertheless, my three biggest problems with this YA novel [notice that I pointed out that this is a Young Adult book -- I feel this is very important in reviewing this novel] are that it is overwritten, filled with melodramatic characters, and the denouement is incredibly long.In claiming LISTENING FOR LIONS to be overwritten, I mean that I found the inexhaustible number of similes, as well as the enormous number of animals and plants mentioned throughout the book seemed so inorganic that I felt like I should have been writing down each one as it is mentioned so that I could be impressed in the end that I had read about so many different examples of the natural world. Enough already! They are distracting from the flow of the writing, and that takes focus from the characters. If writing seems to force in facts or lists or bits of \\"clever creative writing\\" here or there, it destroys the beauty, the flow, the ease of the story.Next, not all, but many of the characters are just too melodramatic. By this, I do not mean that they seem to over-react and seem to be right out of a soap opera. Instead, I mean that they are characterized by the definition of a \\"melodramatic\\" character; in other words, they don't change at all from beginning to end. Anyone who has read this book can easily see that Valerie's parents fit this description quite accurately. Their actions (as well as others) are highly predictable, and don't give the reader a sense that we are going to be surprised by anything...and, unsurprisingly, we aren't. It all seems to play out like a typical melodrama.As for the denouement (or falling action), once we see or anticipate what the ending is going to be, the reader's patience begins to ebb when made to wait excessively. In this case, the final third of the book seems to go on forever. We know where Rachel is going to end up and now we have to wait for it, and wait for it, and wait for it...I truly appreciate the clash of cultures set up in this book, but the basic difficulty I find with LISTENING FOR LIONS is that my students (well-read eighth-graders) will find this to be predictable, uninspiring or not effectively engaging -- particularly in comparison to the dozens of other books that they will be reading this year.Sadly, this book has disappointed me because I don't see it as anything but a Young Adult novel. The best YA books I eagerly endorse and urge adults without kids to read (for example: AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS, SPEAK, CRISS CROSS, PETER AND THE STARCATCHERS, THE GOLDEN COMPASS, ONCE UPON A MARIGOLD, the original THE SECRET GARDEN). This, I'm sorry to write, is not a YA book that is meant for anyone but kids."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"The year is 1919. While Rachel Sheridan's missionary parents spent their childhood cooped up in a musty old orphanage in England, thirteen-year-old Rachel has never known anything other than the wide open wild plains of Africa. A place where leopards and lions roam through the bush, hunting prey, and the sun sets and rises behind colorful mountains each and every day. The beauty of Africa, however, begins to fade when influenza kills her beloved parents, leaving the Kikuyu people void of a doctor to care for them, or a teacher to help them learn. As if that weren't tragic enough, the death of her parents leaves Rachel vulnerable, quickly falling prey to the evil schemes of her wicked, albeit rich, neighbors, the Pritchards. Before Rachel can figure out exactly what is happening, the Pritchards have shipped her off to England posing as their recently deceased daughter, Valerie. Caught up in their criminal scheme, Rachel is left to trick Grandfather Pritchard into leaving his estate to the two greedy parents. While Rachel misses the wild grasslands of the African plains, she learns to love Grandfather Pritchard, and can't stand the fact that she must deceive him in one of the worst possible ways. However, fearing threats of imprisonment from the Pritchards, Rachel continues on with the charade, lying in wait, like the patient lion, for the perfect time when she can spring her secret upon Grandfather, hopefully without killing the sick man altogether. Now, Rachel is set to capture the perfect moment when she can take control of her own existence once more, and find her way back to the home she has always loved. A home that will remain in her heart until the day she can return, and rebuild what her parents attempted to create.As a historical fiction reader, I have encountered Gloria Whelan's books many times over the years, however, I have never actually read one. This all changed when I came across LISTENING FOR LIONS. As I am currently extremely interested in Africa, I was ecstatic to discover this gem. Rachel is a character whom I will never forget. Her caring nature is beautiful, and the fact that she dreams of rebuilding an empire that her parents had begun to create is admirable. Her part playing the pawn in a greedy couples scheme truly touches the reader, and makes them feel for the young orphan who wants nothing more than to save the less-fortunate people around her, and make a name for herself in the medical/missionary world. The interactions between various characters Whelan has created are inspiring, and truly bring the main players to life. From Rachel's conversations with sickly Grandfather Pritchard, to her love for the Kikuyu man Kanoro who cared for her and her parents for years; all the way to the viciously delightful exchanges she shares with the evil Pritchards. Each character plays a major role in shaping the young Rachel from orphan to a dedicated, determined student. This may have been my first book by Gloria Whelan, but I can guarantee that it certainly will not be my last.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"Listening for Lions is an excellent read, reminisce of classics like Jane Eyre, a Little Princess and the Secret Garden this a great gift for a young girl."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of Gloria Whelan, so when this book came out, I automatically wanted to read it. I thought all the characters were well developed, their motivations were clear, and there was beautiful figurative language. However,(maybe because I read the Shadow Children books) I thought the plot was a little guessable. There were some things I hadn't expected, though. Overall, this was a pretty good book (even though I like some of Gloria Whelan's older books more) and I still think people should read it."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"I'll tell you a plot and you tell me what the book is. Okay? Okay. Ahem. A girl lives in a British colony until her parents die of a deadly disease. She is then shipped to lonely manor in England where she learns to appreciate her new country's cold weather and beautiful gardens. Have you guessed it? Because no matter how similar it may sound, we're not talking about Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic tale, \\"The Secret Garden\\". Nope. We are talking about author Gloria Whelan's brand spanking-new, hot of the presses, \\"Listening For Lions\\". Admittedly, my summary of the plot wasn't exactly fair. I mean, it's not as if the heroine of this tale was living in India or anything. And it's not as if Mary Lennox from \\"The Secret Garden\\" spends the entire book trying to get BACK to where she started from. No indeed. What we have here is an entirely different kind of book and one that readers would do very well indeed to stick with. It is not flashy or hilarious or written in a particularly original prose style. It is just stars a girl who kicks butt and takes names.World War I has ended and Britain is sending missionaries to all sorts of supposedly remote locations. One of these, British East Africa, is privy to the Sheridan family. Rachel's father and mother, are both missionaries as well as a doctor and a schoolteacher respectively. Together, they run a small hospital named Tumanini. Rachel, their fifteen-year-old daughter, lives a life that she loves in which she helps out in the hospital and learns as much as she can about the native Kikuyu and Masai tribes. When her parents are both swept up in an deadly influenza epidemic, Rachel finds herself suddenly taken under the malicious wing of the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Pritchard. Their daughter, Valerie, has recently died from the same disease and she (coincidentally enough) shared Rachel's red hair color. Now they've roped this poor orphaned child into masquerading as their deceased offspring, sending her to unfamiliar England to be a companion to Mr. Pritchard's ailing father. They hope that Rachel will get them back into the old man's good will. Rachel, however, hopes that no matter what happens she will somehow find a way to open another hospital in Tumanini and return there herself.We've probably all read a variety of children's book in which the hero is struggling as hard as possible to go \\"home\\". Whether we're talking about Dorothy in \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" or the cute furry animals in \\"The Incredible Journey\\", the urge to return to the familiar is with us always. I mentioned at the beginning of the review that this book had some striking similarities to \\"The Secret Garden\\", but I was mostly being facetious. This book is equal part penny dreadful as well as a very serious story about breaking down gender barriers. Rachel is wrapped up in the Pritchards' nefarious plan and is constantly thwarted (amusingly at times) from telling the truth about herself. This gives the book a kind of kick that it would've been lacking otherwise. If this was just some ho-hum story about a girl being sent to an English orphanage and slowly finding ways, year by year, that will allow her to return to Africa.... well, I'd be asleep ten pages in. With the villainous Pritchards, however, we have someone to fight against and a goal to reach. There are plenty of books that tell straightforward tales without any dashes of suspense or tension. This is not one of them.The writing in this book itself can be fun. For example, when Rachel finds herself learning the human body's many parts, she mentions offhandedly that, \\"I wished we had just been simple amoebas with only a bit of squish to us\\". The passages that relate the natural wonders found in East Africa are eloquent and evocative. There is some difficulty, of course, inherent in a story about a colonist who sees missionary work as all good with no evil inherent. I would have especially appreciated an Afterword of some type at the end that explained exactly what happened to this region in the years to come. Ms. Whelan makes some mention of how her book was partly born from the reminiscences of a missionary physician in Rwanda, but her explanation of what happened to the Rwandans is not necessarily going to connect with the readers of this book. A little more history and a little less fiction would have been nice.I began this book with real hesitation. Until Rachel's parents die the story meanders around and about without much purpose. Kill off the parents though and BAM! It all comes together. By the time Rachel was meeting her \\"grandfather\\" and passing herself off as a rich girl, I was hooked. I suspect some kids may pick up this book, read the first five pages, snore a little, and never pick it up again. If you can convince them that it is well worth reading at least until page 23, you shouldn't have to convince them of much more. A surprisingly engaging book from a surprisingly engaging writer."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"Captivating story of a young girl, raised in Africa, orphaned by the influenza epidemic in 1919, and sent to England. There is a twist, which I won't reveal here, but if you like orphan stories with kindly grandfathers and exotic settings, run right out and read this book. It is aimed at middle school readers, and is perfect for that audience, but older readers would also enjoy it. A one-page Glossary, Author's Note and Bibliography will help interested readers explore further."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"Listening for Lions, by Gloria Whelan was a great book! I only finished reading it. It held me for hours.This book is about Rachel Sheridan, whose parents work in Africa as missionary doctor and teacher. Rachel has grown up in Africa, and loves every bit of it. The people, the animals, the land, the sky, the weather. After her parents die from the sudden influenza that strikes Tumaini, where she lives, she has to stay with the Pritchards, her English neighbors who also lost their daughter. Soon, Rachel is caught up in their deceitful, greedy scheme and is being shipped to England to possibly save an old man...by lying and posing as someone she isn't. Though she's in England, trying to tell the truth and yet not succeeding, her heart is still back in Africa with the people of Tumaini.From the maybe third chapter to the end of part two, this book was absolutely fabulous and gripping. Although I thought the ending wasn't as strong as it might've been, I think it was satisfying enough. Told from first person in a most curiously simple and powerful voice, this is a great book! :D I love the figurative language she uses, and how she uses them to show her feelings. Yes, you should get this book. :)I love the cover art, too."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"A missionary's young daughter serves in Africa with her parents. An influenza outbreak leaves her orphaned and in the treacherous hands of ill-intentioned neighbors. They offer her a way out of sure placement in an orphanage, but it requires her to become an imposter. How will she be true to herself and the values of her parents without risking harm to those she loves most? And how will she find her way back to Africa?Whelan has afforded the reader every detail necessary to richly experience each scene. Whether it be in the disease ridden community of Africa, to a brief stop in Alexandria, or the lush, bird-filled gardens of England, every sensory nuance is fully described with thorough enthusiasm and metaphorical abundance. In fact, a little too much info! She certainly cannot be accused of insufficient research leading to a lack of authenticity!The initial chapters start a little predictably, but don't lose heart. I had not read any spoiler reviews and was thoroughly engaged in the surprise conflict with anticipation for the resolve. The middle of the book definitely reached the \\"can't put it down\\" stage. A wonderfully logical ending presents itself, but Whelan plods along far past that point before ending it in a satisfying conclusion.It's among the best books I've read - with a deduction for literary overkill. This author is definitely a \\"more is more\\" thinker. In my opinion, less would have sufficed."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"Listening for lions is a good book, but nothing about it is screams extraordinary. I found the story to be interesting in a way, but also quite predictable. After about the first 50 pages I could more or less guess what was going to happen in the rest of the book. The part I liked about this book is the telling of a different culture and life style in place unlike were I live.This book in my opinion is one of those books that I can pick up, and not feel the need to finish it. If it was not on my school book list I probably would not have finished reading this book if I started it.This is a good book though, and if you are in the mood for an easy read I suggest this, but Listening For Lions is not the type of book i feel everyone needs to read."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"My children LOVED this book, they read it and reread it and now the pages are falling apart.

While I am not usually wild about books without much \\"action,\\" my students and I were really hooked into this book, due to Whelan's character development and interplay. The book was (as many of Whelan's books are) great at illustrating for students the use of symbolism in writing (see also Whelan's HOMELESS BIRD and MIRANDA'S LAST STAND, among others, for examples of symbolism that students can grasp). At the end of the book, my students even broke into spontaneous applause!While some of Whelan's recent books (i.e., CHU JU'S HOUSE and ST. PETERSBURG #3 / BURYING THE SUN) were starting to sound the same, LISTENING FOR LIONS seemed much fresher in comparison. Nevertheless, many of the same story elements are here as in Whelan's other recent novels:A strong heroine in an international setting loses her loving family and goes on a long, harrowing journey. At some point, she falls under the control of a villainous character (or duo) who tries to make her believe they are looking out for her best interests (out of pity) while they are actually taking advantage of her and her situation for their own gain while they belittle her and keep her down. Eventually she breaks free of their domination, stands on her own, and makes new bonds with new friends / family who truly care about her, and gains the means to provide for herself with a bright future. There is some variation of this story arc in her recent books, but while all of Whelan's books are great if taken on their own, readers of several of her recent works (most of her longer books since HOMELESS BIRD) may feel they are reading a slight rehash of others. For this reason, I can only give the book a 4 instead of a 5 - if I was a new reader of Whelan's books, this would be a definite 5.While I have enjoyed all of Whelan's children's books (I still haven't read the three adult books - they're finally getting close to the top of my reading shelves), my favorite Whelan books would be HOMELESS BIRD (National Book Award winner), FRUITLANDS, THE WANIGAN, GOODBYE VIETNAM, MIRANDA'S LAST STAND, HANNAH, the \\"Mackinac Island Trilogy,\\" LISTENING FOR LIONS, and the rare but wonderful picture book BRINGING THE FARMHOUSE HOME.Whelan says she has several more upcoming books in the works - THE TURNING (the 4th and final St. Petersburg book, due in January '06), THE SUMMER OF THE WAR (due in summer of '06), and (in '07) two more picture books for Sleeping Bear Press, one for the 50th anniversary of the Mackinac Bridge and the other set in Mali, West Africa. Whelan also pointed out to me that the jacket illustrator of Listening for Lions is the same illustrator who did the Lemony Snicket books - who would've guessed?Anyway, for \\"contemplative\\" students who don't need a huge amount of action in their reading, it's hard to go wrong with Whelan's books - her excellent quality is consistent."},{"Title":"Listening for Lions","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter and she hasn't had a chance to read it because both my mother in-law and I have read it first.

But she doesn't want the Pritchards to get mad at her and punish her. Will she tell her grandfather the truth?In the beginning of the book, Rachel was shy and obedient.

Like Heidi, she is orphaned and taken away from her home in Africa, yet enchants an old man and enlarges his life. I, too, have lived in Africa and found the descriptions of the veld, hoopoes, and acacia trees refreshing and real. I don't know if students unfamiliar with Africa would take to the story, but a picture glossary could educate those who haven't had the privilege. The story's villains are painted stereotypically, but the twists and turns in the plot are satisfying, and Rachel's perserverance shines at the conclusion. I would like for students who aren't ready for Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible to read this for a picture of African colonization at its best and worst.

As many scientists that support it are against it. The more I read about global warming the more I believe that it is a political agenda rather than a fact.

So say members of the Rice family several times. This play, while not about the Angry Young Man generation of Look Back in Anger, is about the same era, and the disillusionment of the same class. Archie Rice is, like his father Billy was, a showman in local music halls. But the popularity of the music hall is going to the dogs and nobody seems to care, not even Archie.The Rice family lives together, Grandpa Billy, son Archie, Archie's wife Pheobe, and Archie and Pheobe's son Frank. Then Archie's daughter Jean shows up. What becomes is underlying and expressed tension that reminded me at times of Pinter's The Homecoming. Snipping and age old feuds present themselves as Jean, surprisingly home from London realizes how stuck and angry and numb her family is and has been. She is the Angry Young Woman, who senses her frustration and wants to do something about it.This is an aged English play, with references and slang that were at times obstacles to a twenty-something in LA. But Osborne powerfully writes the Rice family, layering indignation and memory and hardships of being lower class in England in the late 50's. Archie, who straddles the world of the family and the music hall is that hopelessly driven entertainer, senseless to his schtick's long ago death, hamming it up all the way through the s--t of life. And still Jean, who is the true vibrancy of the play is left with: \\"Here we are, we're alone in the universe, there's no God, it just seems that it all began by something as simple as sunlight striking a piece of rock. And here we are. We've only got ourselves. Somehow, we've just got to make a go of it.

The story's set in the 1830s and is 1/3 focused on politics (i.e. a fascinating insight into the electioneering process and the fight for a Parliamentary seat between the Torys and the Radicals), 1/3 on family and sensational issues (e.g. illegitimacy, dispute over who has the legitimate claim on the wealthy estates of the Transome family and plenty of blackmail, manipulation and betrayals) and 1/3 devoted to a love triangle.George Eliot wrote so eloquently and beautifully that many times I find myself re-reading a particular phrase in order to saviour its beautiful words. Each chapter also starts with either a beautiful poem or some well-chosen lines from Shakespeare/the Classics. Here's a favourite of mine from Chapter 45 (a poem by Eliot):&quot;We may not make this world a paradiseBy walking it together with clasped handsAnd eyes that meeting feed a double strength.We must be only joined by pains divine,Of spirits blent in mutual memories&quot;.I confess that above all, it is the suspense over the touching love story that kept me turning the pages very quickly. The hero is Felix Holt, a passionate, idealistic young man who studies medicine but chooses to quit midway and forgo a comfortable future as a doctor in favour of leading the more righteous life (in his opinion) of an ordinary, poor workingman because of his scorn for wealth and its corrupting powers. Felix is described as honest, brusque, generous and highly intelligent. He's got &quot;wild hair&quot;, dresses simple and to his own liking e.g. not wearing a cravat &quot;like all the other gentlemen&quot;, and sometimes looks like a &quot;barbarian&quot;. He patronizes no one and is rather unpopular in the town of Treby Magna where the story takes place. His political views are Radical (i.e. more severe than the Liberals) but his main concerns are for the well-being of the working class and especially the future of their children. (Read the excellent &quot;Address to Working Men by Felix Holt&quot; which comes after the Epilogue). Felix's good intentions land him in great trouble with the law later on when a massive riot breaks out among the drunk working class directly after the election and Felix is wrongly accused of being the leader of the mob.Early on in the novel, Felix is introduced to the heroine, Esther Lyon (the beautiful daughter of a poor chapel minister) whose vanity and high-bred manner he scorns. He rebukes and lectures her constantly in that straight-forward and honest manner of his because he cares to improve her views on what are truly the important things in life. Esther dislikes him utterly at first... she cannot understand why Felix doesn't admire her beauty and graceful manners like other young men do. Esther is vain and proud (at least, initially) and has always dreamed of leading a better life, with fineries and beautiful clothes and servants to do her bidding. And Felix Holt is definitely not her idea of a lover! But Esther is not unkind or ungenerous - she loves her father dearly and treats everyone well. Gradually, she begins to see the true nature of Felix's character and noble aims, and holds him in great esteem, despite his outward looks and manners. But Felix has declared never to marry and if he were ever to fall in love, he would just &quot;bear it and not marry&quot; (preferring to &quot;wed poverty&quot;). Later in the novel, Esther is courted by the rich and handsome Harold Transome whose initial reason for wooing her is to save his family estates. But he doesn't count on falling in love with her subsequently.Who does Esther ends up with finally: Felix or Harold? But take it from me that the romantic scenes between Felix and Esther are the most passionate and heart-wrenching I've ever come across in a classic literature - with many kisses and hugs amidst pure longing and despair, and scenes filled with beautifully spoken words of affection which brought tears to my eyes.For many, many reasons, &quot;Felix Holt&quot; makes for a most brilliant read. I urge you not to miss it."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"Some might say nothing can equal Middlemarch as Eliot's greatest work but I think that even if Felix Holt doesn't rank alongside it in literature, it should be given at least an equal status.The novel deals with provincial politics in nineteenth century England through the mouthpiece of one of the best male protagonists ever drwan in literature by a female writer. As in all her books, Eliot is sharp in her details, the satire is poignant and she doesn't miss out on humor. Feminism takes a different turn here, with telling criticisms on the way females were brought up at that time and in many third world countries, still are brought up.Eliot is never bitter, never hopeless, yet always realistic and idealistic with this difference: she doesn't let it get out of control. Fear not: mawkish is the last thing this book is. Some details might seem to be superfluous but it adds up to showing the literary prowess of this great woman, and is very helpful in letting you understand the real stuff going on at that time. A good, very well-written socio-political novel, that depicts the atmosphere of its time with more accuracy than many other books I've read.Eliot does have the most amazing ability to get into her characters' minds. although this book is an all rounder in the sense that it comments on most social issues, the two main intimate themes of the books are personal to the central character, Felix, the most &quot;alive&quot; hero of nineteenth century literature: his politics and his love interest, in herself a very compelling and subtly drwan character.Worth reading for all Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy fans. Will definitely give you two or three new opinions: even if the time period is different, much of the philosophy of the book is still very relevant."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) was a great English novelist ofthe Victorian period. Her list of classics is impressive:\\"Scenes from Clerical Life'; \\"Adam Bede\\"; \\"The Mill on the Floss\\"Middlemarch\\" and \\"Daniel Deronda\\" are among the greatest novelsever written in the English Language.Felix Holt tells the story of a radical candidate for Parliament. He has become a watchmaker; cares for his motherand courts Esther Lyon the sophisticated daughter of a poorminister. Esther is also courted by Harold Transome who likeHolt is also a Radical candidate for Parliament. Harold is rich, 35, a widower with a young son. Holt is young, fiery and idealistic.The most interesting character in the novel is Mrs. Transome who has secrets to keep. She is well drawn by Eliot.In addition to the love story is the tale of an inheritance.This tangled delve into old documents is complex and may losesome readers.The tale climaxes with a working man's revolt and other suprises for the interested reader. The book is not as long assome of her novels but does hold one's interest.This is not Eliot's best novel but it is worth reading."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"Felix Holt occupies a middle-tier in the critical estimation of Eliot's novels. It is often disparaged as the \\"political novel,\\" or alternatively \\"the one where the legal subplot is way too complicated.\\"At first, this seems unfair. The early introduction of Mrs. Transome is a showstopper, heroine Esther Lyon fascinates, and the detailed evocation of 19th century rural politics is through Eliot's narrative magic made riveting.But things do go awry in the second half. A big problem is Felix himself: an idealization of a political view rather than a detailed character, the reader loves him rather less than Eliot seems to intend. The legal schenanigans are intriguing, but the tortuous plot machinations through which Felix comes to be imprisoned are near ridiculous. And finally, Esther experiences her moral conversion rather too quickly and tidily, coming to seem just a sketch for Gwendolyn Harleth in the later Daniel Deronda. Indeed, by book's end the most compelling plot thread standing is that of the unfortunate Mrs. Transome.But to say a book isn't as good as Daniel Deronda isn't much of a criticism. For all its faults, Felix Holt is filled with excellent characters, a strong story, and unparalled insight into both 19th century England and the more universal collisions of morality and politics."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"George Eliot is an acquired taste. If one were to pick up only one of her books it would probably be &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;, &quot;Silas Marner&quot; or &quot;Middlemarch&quot; and with any one of those might come frustration with Eliot's myriad of plots (not to mention her tendency for being a bit wordy). But I found &quot;Felix Holt&quot;, for all its political twists and turns, to be the most accessible of Eliot's books. This accessibility can be attributed to two of the finest characters ever created: Mrs. Transome and Ester Lyon. I would say that the character of Mrs. Transome ranks up there with Emma Bovary in terms of literary creation and chapters 42 and 49 (I don't want to give away the story) are absolutely cinematic.

It portrays 19th century election processes in their full, colourful detail: corruption, intimidation, vote-buying and all, while leaving room for hope and ultimately painting a fascinating picture of nascent democracy. It is also endowed with George Eliot's subtle dialogue and keen eye for psychological and social nuance.I have only read Middlemarch by the same author. The much thicker and better known work has a wider cast of characters and, with its more slowly-paced plot, it provides a deeper analysis of early Victorian country mores, but it is also a more classical piece of social study. \`Felix Holt' is a busier, rowdier novel, yet I found it just as convincing and engaging in its characters and relations. It is entertaining on multiple levels; this is a book that appeals both to readers with a historical interest and to those simply looking for a good intrigue. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"I've heard a lot of moaning this year about how democracy is dead and how much better things were in the good old days. Eliot's unromantic view of human nature is the perfect cure for all that. As she tells it, people were dumb, and cunning, and selfish back then - just as they are today. The biggest difference was that most people weren't allowed to vote: &quot;universal suffrage&quot; was about as beyond-the-pale then as gay marriage is today.Here's the TV preview version: _Felix Holt_ is a lively mix of barroom treating, soapbox preachers, riots, bribery, &quot;irregularities,&quot; and a courtroom scene with a shocking finale! One caveat: readers spoiled on modern pap may find this novel difficult going. But it's worth it."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"Felix Holt combines themes of political responsibility and social concern amidst the background of a community that is facing problems involved with the rapid industrialization of the country. Eliot depicts a village caught in a battle between tradition and progressivism. The characters who make up this struggle are brilliantly portrayed. There is even a sweet romantic twist to the story that renders it even more enjoyable. Eliot gives one the impression that in order for society to make advances for the good of all, some people must willingly give up the prosperity and status that accompanies a largely capitalistic state. It is through such noble acts that those less fortunate can gain a voice in a system that constantly represses them. This is the major theme of this incredible novel."},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"If I had known this copy was purposely left unedited and full of typos I would not have purchased. I struggled to overlook them but the book was unreadable. Unfortunately, by the time I gave up and sought a better copy, none were available and I missed my class. This should have been stressed upfront... in fact, why would anyone WANT an unreadable copy?"},{"Title":"Felix Holt, The Radical (Everyman Paperbacks)","review":"If you're looking for a novel propelled by its plot, then perhaps you should look elsewhere. Felix Holt, as well as the other characters of this novel, are more stock-types set in concrete than actual individuals, and the (far-too-complicated) legal issue that pushes the novel foward is never much convincing and quickly set aside in the end for the sake of moralizing. But then, the background - the socio-political changes in the Early 19th. Century English countryside, brought in the wake of the first Reform Act - is throughly and convincingly described, specially at the opening of the novel, which is, in itself, a must-read."},{"Title":"Countdown","review":"\\"Countdown\\" was published in 1970, the year after American astronauts became the first Earth-dwellers to set foot on the moon. In this novel, Frank G. Slaughter offers up his vision of a (then) not-too-distant future; no exact date is given, but one can infer that it's the late 1970s, possibly the early '80s. The area around Cape Canaveral has been built up into a thriving community devoted primarily to the aerospace industry: Spaceport City. As this novel opens, the city is abuzz with final preparations for the launch of the massive space station Pegasus, just a few weeks away.Dr. Michael Barnes grew up in Florida, but ever since the traumatic accident that ended his own career venturing into space - and the humiliating hearings that followed - he's been lying low in California, working quietly in the field of space medicine (the study of the effects of spaceflight conditions on the human body). Best known for his research on the breakdown of marriages and families among aerospace personnel, Mike is satisfied with his peaceful life - until a call from an old friend on the Senate Space Oversight Committee, asking him to head to Spaceport City for a private investigation into the Pegasus project. Mike agrees, and soon he finds himself immersed in a work-hard, play-hard world where he will be faced with love, danger, and corruption in high places.Readers today will find \\"Countdown\\" pretty dated, and the novel is perhaps best read now not as futuristic fiction but as alternative history, a glimpse into what it might have been like if the American space program had kept on picking up steam instead of more or less fizzling out after Apollo. It's not so smoothly written as it could be (not surprising in the work of an author who regularly churned out two or three novels a year); a number of characters are introduced who add little or nothing to the story, and several subplots that seem terribly important in the beginning are all but dropped as the novel progresses, only to be wrapped up tidily in the end.Still, for all this novel's flaws, it's darn good reading. It's got everything: budding romance, mortal peril, a few slightly seedy bits, a mystery or two, a hypocritical religious fanatic, technical details of medicine and astronautics engagingly presented in a way you don't need an advanced degree to understand, and a bang-up climax. Slaughter's observations on the \\"human element\\" of every technological endeavor - and how it can make or break the mightiest project - are as relevant and sobering today as they ever were. The backstory Slaughter has created for his characters and the official agencies within which they work is seamlessly melded into the real history of the space program, blurring the lines between pure fact and pure fantasy in a way that helps the reader suspend his disbelief and accept this history-that-might-have-been.\\"Countdown\\" is a suspenseful, engaging read, with protagonists you can't help but root for (and a few bad guys you'll love to hate). If you enjoyed Crichton's \\"Airframe,\\" you won't want to miss it."},{"Title":"A glossary to Morals and dogma","review":"This book is basically a look up for words found in Albert Pike's \\"Morals and Dogma\\". It appears to be a favorite among those studying the book and seems to be an item found in many Masonic lodges.What I was hoping for was more of the explanation of where Pike got his information from, or: is this book something Pike put together on his own or did he put together a few other authors or is this a standard Masonic way of looking at things (Ancient Mystery tradition), etc. and the book does not provide that. I am hoping it is the Author's other books (\\"A Bridge to Light\\" or \\"Pillars of Wisdom: The Writings of Albert Pike\\")...The reasons I am looking for this is that, basically, if you read Eliphas Levi's \\"Dogma and Ritual of High Magic\\" (also called \\"Transcendental Magic\\" in English), then you will notice some very similar ideas and concepts. It was originally published in French (which Pike could read) in 1856, over 10 years before 1971 when Pike's book was published. In fact, Levi's book was not translated into English until 1896. So if it remains true (that many of the ideas given by Pike are actually Levi's) then Pike presented the material in English first, allowing for a paradigm shift from these ideas being associated with Magic/Occultism to them being associated with Masonry. And, in reality, Levi is teaching esoteric Kabalah, so the ideas are not in conflict with Masonry, but it just seems like knowing and recognizing the source would be helpful and allow the serious student to learn more from the authentic source."},{"Title":"Stalkers: 19 Original Tales By the Masters of Terror","review":"Rather than a collection of creep-up-on chronicles or chase-scene scenarios, this audiobook is comprised of an eclectic blend of stories of unfortunates plagued by stalkers both psychological and logical, earthly and unearthly. Revenge, guilt, lust, and desperation drive both perpetrator and victim in locales as frighteningly diverse as dark city streets, Amazon jungles, and deep-South swamps.

The title has been under public domain for nearly a century. If anyone like to read this old hunting tale, Bibliofile, like Kessinger publishing and dozens of other print on demand vendors, will supply a copy in paperback or hardcover edition.My hardcover edition arrived almost a month after ordering it. The book promised 'numerous illustrations', and when checked the details 10 illustrations were 'listed' in the contents page. In reality there were no illustrations at all, instead blank pages were inserted between text pages. This is a disappointment. With the postage, the book would cost you at least $36.00US, and it is a shame that the publishers (Bibliofile) conveniently omitted the illustrations at the cost of pennies for each title."},{"Title":"John Quincy Adams","review":"A relatively short and informative work of another large life in early America.

This is a superb reference book for the young and old intelligence officer in a Joint or Interagency environment that needs to know how the intelligence system in the United States works. Richelson does not write in theory. All of this book is practical, useful and hard-hitting. It will give you excellent depth and insight into those often heard but little known intelligence successes and debacles. From the USS Pueblo to the origin and current status of satellite intelligence, this book covers it all."},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"This one was a great reference up to 10 September 2001. Then everything changed and much of what is in this book is out of date. To be fair though, there is stll considerable value here, but that value puts it into the 'buy a used one' category (but hey, that slightly dog-eared, somewhat out of date, reference work on the shelf behind your desk gives you that 'old hand' 'been there, done that' credibility, so this isn't all bad.)What's good about this one:-The description of the intelligence cycle.-The discussions of challenges facing the U.S. intelligence community post Cold War (but pre-9/11; belay that, many of the issues addressed are still challenges that have not been resolved, just set to one side in the pursuit of the global war on terror).-The description and discussion of the processes and policies surrounding the intelligence cycle.-It is a good reference work for tracing the establishment of several of the agencies.What's not so good about this:-The world changed two years after this book's publication in 1999. And all the shortcomings of this book stem from this. The description of the strategic organization of the U.S. military is not accurate. The Dept. of Homeland Security is not mentioned. The National Intelligence Director is not mentioned. Bin Laden and Al Qaeda aren't mentioned. The patriot act isn't here. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency is here under its old name, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. And so forth...-There have been some bigger changes that are mostly technology driven. At the time this book was written, the idea that one could get 1 meter resolution satellite imagery for free (though a little dated) was pretty shocking for most folks, but if you go to Google maps right now...Over all, 'The U.S. Intelligence Community' is out of date for descriptions of the current establishment and much of the technology, but is pretty darn good for processes and some of the big concepts. Caveat lector: be mindful that technology changes constantly, and what's in this book was declassified, hence even further out of date than the copyright date would indicate.Post Script: Thank you, W. Blair for pointing out that there is a newer edition. This review only applies to the fourth, not fifth and current edition. Darn you, W. Blair, for forcing my hand to get the new edition 8-)E. M. Van Court"},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"Richelson does his homework and provides a volume about the structure of the intelligence community either citing current data, or the most recently released declassified data concerning currently classified programs. Ultimately the book is a reference, not a read. He offers only a few pages of analysis on his work, so there is no new perspective on hot topics concerning the structure or function of the IC. That being said, there are not a lot of other books out there about the USIC, so you may have to go with this one if you want to know anything."},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"I have copies of editions 2, 3, 4 and now the 5th edition of this book - and it has gotten better each time. Dr. Richelson's study of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is amazing, and a testament to how useful open source information is. While some of the information is inaccurate (and I *can't* say what... ;-), it is to the benefit of the reader that this book offers so many sources. If its wrong, its not because he guessed wrong - it has been mentioned elsewhere. While not being 100% accurate, I would render a guess that 90% to 95% hits near the mark.That aside, the organizational charts are amazing and very useful. This book has been used in the American Military University's intelligence studies program as a foundation textbook for many classes (coupled with other good books too!). While some spooks stick in their niche areas, others have copies of this book on their shelf to see what the rest of the IC does...The only downside for this book - the cost. I would have never imagined paying near $50 on a paperback book. It was worth the cost though..."},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"I have read each edition of this fascinating book as it has been published. Sadly, each has served as a historical reference only. For those not well versed in this field this provides a detailed overview of the community. Mr. Richelson's latest Edition (number 5) is far more interesting and draws you in while still providing in depth knowledge."},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"\\"The US Intelligence Community\\" (5th Edition) represents an impressive amount of open source research into the structure, the functions, and the current challenges of post-9/11 US Intelligence. Jeffrey Richelson's experience as a longtime outside observer of the US intelligence community has enabled him to scour the corners of the media, academia, and a variety of archives for the many bits and pieces that make up this book.In roughly 550 pages, Richelson covers the basics of intelligence, the various national intelligence and military service intelligence organizations, the different intelligence disciplines, liaison with foreign intelligence services, analysis, counterintelligence, covert action, and the challenges of managing the US intelligence community. A final chapter addresses some recent controversial issues.The good news is that \\"The US Intelligence Community\\" is a valuable teaching resource, presented in a remarkably even-handed way. The not-so-good news is that portions of the book are dry reading. The bad news, for the informed consumer, is that key information and valuable perspective are sometimes available only at the classified level. A book this heavily dependent on media reporting will inevitably have only part of the story, and part of that wrong.\\"The US Intelligence Community\\" is highly recommended as an unclassified guide and teaching resource on the subject of the US Intelligence Community."},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"We were very please with our order.

The defining of problems and contents are addressed logical one after the other, without directing the reader to jump through the book, other chapters, to obtain a better picture of the resolve. The author did their work and some items of interests within the Iraq occupation were outlined and later identified again show trends in behavior of the IC. All though some issues are more directed at the CIA and their means of operation, tying one arm behind their back to expect better information was not the answer either. The text is focused on a grad level understanding of the IC and with that said other books have done equal if not better attempts in providing an introduction arena on the IC. But for depth and a good source of past/present issues, which is easy to comprehend then this book did a very good job at it."},{"Title":"The U.S. Intelligence Community","review":"I got this book for a class.

It is well-written, sympathetic to the subject, yet fair. You learn that Frances was the warm-hearted child of a reserved mother and an affectionate father; just a very nice, somewhat emotionally insecure girl, who unfortunately made the mistake of marrying the wrong man (The Earl Spencer), and has basically had to pay for that mistake, for her whole life.Some of the mistakes of her own upbringing were repeated by her with her children, to the greater detriment of her two younger children. However, it could be be said that a major part of the damage done to Diana and to Charles Spencer occurred because Frances lost custody thanks to her mother & The Earl Spencer's machinations, and the mores of the time. She was sidelined as a mother, both by this failed custody action and because she removed herself from England with her new husband, seeking a new beginning. The failed custody action and what Frances' mother did caused an unhealed breach in family relations which seems to remain unresolved to this day.It's good to read \\"her side\\", after hearing so much gossipy garbage about how she \\"bolted\\" from Diana's father for another man, and learning the real reasons behind her decision. Also, Paul Burrell's recent book portrays Frances SO badly (and I believe most unfairly). Frances deserved the chance to tell her version of events and in Max Riddington she found the means to do so. It's well done, interesting, and a must-read for those who want to hear ALL sides of the story of Frances, and to understand the character of Diana, Princess of Wales a little better too."},{"Title":"Frances: The Remarkable Story of Princess Diana's Mother","review":"While there are some interesting tidbits in this book, it can in no way be called an objective biography. The authors developed a close relationship with the subject and it shows. Some insight would have be interesting in the area of her alcohol use, her feelings about Diana's choice of Muslim men, Charles Spencer's womanizing, her religious conversion and her ultimate isolation from society at large. The book is instead a compilation of her philosophies about life and childrearing. With her youngest two children (Diana and Charles) clearly so badly damaged by their parents divorce, it would have been interesting to get her views on her responsibility for the end product. There is none of this. In the end, it is the last photo of Mrs. Shand Kydd in the book that says much more than the book does. Alone on her island looking sad, old and careworn."},{"Title":"Frances: The Remarkable Story of Princess Diana's Mother","review":"I enjoyed this book and thought it was well written.

While a sympathetic character, she has always seemed somewhat mysterious and I can't say this has cleared much up in that regard. I'm unsure why she agreed to cooperate with this effort, unless she knew it was to be written anyway and thought she'd try and get her part right. She seems a lonely and isolated figure, partly by her own design, but nonetheless seems to have not had such a nice life after her first marriage. Her second marriage seems to have been ruined by her daughter's fame. I consider myself a bit of an expert on the POW, and unfortunately this book didn't tell me much I didn't know already."},{"Title":"An Unthymely Death and Other Garden Mysteries: A Treasury of Stories, Herbal Lore, Recipes and Crafts (China Bayles Mystery)","review":"I have just discovered the wonderful novels by Susan Wittig Albert, and I am playing catch-up trying to read all the past installment of the China Bayles saga.Imagine my delight upon finding this delightful collection of short stories.I love that these stories are a great deal more light-hearted than the usual serious themes found in the book length tales.

Pecan Springs is a small town, filled with small town folk and lots of good eating. In the ten cases assembled here, China solves the problem of who wtole the cookbook of out the Guild, and what happened to the cat, cutely named KHAT. When she does, she discovers a new member of the community, Ivy O'Toole, who is sort of a heavyset woman but one who knows a lot about herbs.There isn't that much in the book about Mike McQuaid, China's new handsome hubby, but readers who like Mike will appreciate the glimpses we get into his private life. There is a more \\"adult\\" case about a man who feels he has been \\"stalked\\" and whose answering machine turns into a valuable clew in the mystery of the poisoned brownies. It is sort of like FATAL ATTRACTION, with a Pecan Springs twist. In addition, there are lots of little sidebars about herbs and how herbs can make your life better. As China suggests, planting a fragrance garden near your porch is a nice way to let their fragrance comfort you in times of loss or inspire you to help out a neighbor or two. She suggests planting carmint, chamomile, clove pink, lavender, lemon balm and nine more, winding up with violets (alphabetical order, but i think they'd look pretty that way).

It all boils down to the fact that fruit was the original diet of man - not coffee, alcohol, meat, etc. Adam and Eve didn't know about these things or if they did, they certainly didn't eat/drink these things.Of course, sin entered into the world so then vegetables were introduced (see Genesis 2)and the meat after the flood for Noah and his family. But I don't believe God intended for Noah and his family to continue eating meat.

An easy to use gloassary makes translations rather easy as the editors let you know which use of a word a particular section is going for (when there's more than one meaning for that word, obviously).About the only drawback I found was the fact that the paperback was a bit flimsy. While I used the book daily in my Anglo-Saxon class, the book began to fall apart after about two weeks. Fortunately I found a used hardcover version of the book and was able to retire my paperback. Don't let this put you off, though, if you want to learn the language. The content is top-notch and very well explained and presented.

Still, it was helpful in reading along with the \\"Anglo Saxon Aloud\\" website, and fiddling aloud with what online translations I could find.It makes me sad, though for different reasons the poems themselves make me sad. At one point, the American educational system was solid enough that High School students would use this reader to familiarize themselves with the language which preceded English. They also used to learn Latin; something I've had better luck with learning a bit of on my own thus far. This wasn't in some starched shirt Edwardian antiquity; my baby boomer parents know some Anglo Saxon. I have a Ph.D., and this sort of thing was apparently never thought worth my time. I don't know any Ph.D.'s in English literature who bothered with Anglo Saxon either; apparently this important part of English speaking heritage is now relegated to obscure boffins.

This text covers all of these and offers both solid theoretical background as well as plenty of real world examples. I do recommend substituting the dramatic narrative chapter with a specialized text for screenplay writing, but it covers the basics.

She's a good girl, and is very close to her father; she does her best to please him and to live up to his expectations, including getting engaged to Michael, Judge Sewell's son.Billy Bob Walker is known for getting into fights and in general being the town's favorite subject for gossip. He's also Judge Sewell's unacknowledged illegitimate son.Four years ago, Shiloh and Billy Bob had a secret and very sweet romance, until her father found out and broke them up. They went their separate ways--she to college and he to help out on his grandfather's farm. Both are heartbroken, but her father, and circumstances, had done a very thorough job of driving them apart.Now, Billy is in jail for getting into a brawl and is unable to pay the fine. Shiloh meets him there after getting caught for speeding (when she finally snapped and had to get away from the men in her life.) They make a deal--she pays his fine in exchange for his agreeing to a marriage in name to her, so that she won't have to marry her fiance.So begins their path to happiness, but it's very rocky--he has his pride and his struggles to make something of himself. He's also had to face a lifetime of people thinking he's worthless trash, especially his father. She's trying to find herself and to move away from the shadow of her father's influence (he disowned her completely after her marriage). There are outside factors working to drive them apart as well, such as the Sewells, Shiloh's father, and the whole town's prejudices. The small town itself is protrayed very well and gives the book an authentic air. And the dialogue feels natural and just flows so well, you can hear the southern drawls in their speech.That was just a description of the book's bones and doesn't come close to conveying the sheer emotion and poignancy in the story. The characters are drawn so realistically and nothing feels overly contrived. I like how Billy is characterized: he's tough, possessive, and just such a man. After he and Shiloh get married, she looks over at him and muses, \\"I wonder what kind of husband you'd really make.\\" And he answers without hesitation, \\"A damned good one.\\" He appears to be a worthless good-time boy, but in reality he works and gives everything he has for those he loves. And Shiloh is no passive Southern belle; she holds on to the principles she knows are right, and she's strong enough to take on her father, the town, and her new circumstances, all the while helping to build up a happy future for her and Billy.This is a very compelling love story. It's about unconditional love that can overcome the biggest obstacles, it's about being true to yourself, and it's about how loving can help make people stronger. The ending is very well-done and the conflicts are realistically and satisfyingly resolved. This is one of the best romance novels I've ever read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Billy Bob Walker Got Married (Harper Monogram)","review":"My first Lisa G. Brown was picked up because of the various recommendations of the title on the Amazon romance discussion forum. This title kept cropping up on various threads on the forum which led me to obtain a copy of this title, which I had a real hard time getting shipped to Maldives since its out-of-print now. It might be because I had such high expectations because of the rave reviews this story has received that I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought that I would. However that doesn't mean that this is a bad read by any means but rather it didn't live up to all my high expectations which I believe tends to happen to us readers now and again.27 year old William Robert Walker aka Billy Bob Walker comes from the wrong side of the town of Sweetwater. The illegitimate son of the honorable Judge Robert Sewell who has ignored his very existence by forgetting his affair with the innocent country girl Ellen Walker, Billy's mother, Billy has a chip a mile wild on his shoulders that lands him in spots of trouble now and then. With a reputation for being wild, no one really sees the ambitious heart that beats within Billy and his aspirations to become someone who would one day show his good for nothing father that the son he had ignored for all his life in favor of his legitimate son Michael could make something out of himself. 6 ft 3 inches tall, long-limbed and lanky with broad square shoulders, Billy sets many a heart aflutter with his easy charm and masculinity. Billy's passion lies in becoming a veterinarian but life and its ultimate choices had inevitably ended him a little further away from attaining his dream.22 year old Shiloh Pennington is the cossetted and protected daughter of Sam Pennington, the banker of the town of Sweetwater. A man who had risen from a low wage job at a tiny mill to become what he is today, Sam wants nothing but the best for his only daughter whom he had raised single-handedly ever since Shiloh's mother Caroline had walked out on them when Shiloh had just been 5 years old. A woman known for her beauty and loose morales when it comes to men, Sam had always kept a tight leash on Shiloh wanting to protect her from every evil in the world and tries his damnedest to shape Shiloh to follow his dreams and ambitions for her rather than her own. Shiloh is a woman trapped in a world created for her by her father and she tries her hardest to please Sam in every way possible until she breaks off her engagement to Michael Sewell, an act that infuriates Sam to no end.The overly protected Shiloh who had always stayed away from men had her world turned upside down the summer she had turned 18, when she had run into Billy Bob Walker when he had been sent by his grandfather to landscape Pennington's yard. Their affair had started out innocently enough and had been brought to a cruel halt by Sam who had presumed to know that Billy Bob Walker wasn't what his Shiloh deserved or needed in life. Now 4 years later, these two cross paths again when Billy who is in jail serving time for riling up his father in court finds himself in the company of Shiloh who is brought in for totaling her car by speeding, trying in reality to get away from the stifling presence of the Sewells who her father tries to force her to accept. And when Shiloh sees her way out of getting married to Michael and getting back at Sam for trying to force her affections on a man who frightens her to no end by proposing marriage to Billy in exchange for his freedom from jail, a shaky relationship of sorts develops between two people who are wary of trusting the other as past hurts and Shiloh's father tries his best to drive these two apart.I liked:1- The premise of this story. I found myself intrigued with the concept of the heroine offering money to the hero to marry her just for convenience's sake. And with such vast differences in their upbringings there was bound to be a lot of problems which Ms. Brown tackled with throughout the story.2- The vivid descriptions of the small town life that brought this book to life and gave it an added lustre. It is always heartening to see a story bring to life what goes on in small towns such as the one in this story.3- As I read through this story, I was at first really frustrated with Shiloh's character as she kept swaying back and forth between her feelings for Billy, which always pisses me off when it comes to heroines. But in the end, Shiloh proves that she loves Billy for who he is and does some growing up of her own and stands up for herself in front of her controlling father which earned her my approval in the end.I disliked:1- The way Shiloh couldn't make up her mind till around more than half way through the book. It kept my head spinning in circles whilst Shiloh tried to divide her loyalties between the father who had raised her with love although Sam controls her life and she lets it happen; and her husband whom she has a hard time accepting at first.2- Billy's doggone pride that kept interfering with what was taking place between Shiloh and himself. As feelings continued to intensify between the two, Billy has a hard time accepting the fact that Shiloh's upbringing had provided her with the best of things in life which Billy is unable to provide her with. Sam's interference certainly didn't help matters but I wished at times I could slap Billy on the face to make him sit up and see what he was doing to their relationship with his beloved pride to keep him company by his side.Reviewed by: Maldivian Book Reviewer"},{"Title":"Billy Bob Walker Got Married (Harper Monogram)","review":"I'm a Southerner that has lived all over the US and the world with my military hubby of 25 years. What makes us a unique group of people comes through Ms. Brown's books better than any author I've read. She has captured the Southern psyche and mannerisms.Billy Bob Walker reminds us that people and circumstances aren't always what they seem on the outside. Billy Bob, a young man from the wrong side of the blanket, as well as the tracks, is far more noble and honorable than his priveleged half-brother, Michael Sewell who has had the advantage of the best things and education that money can buy. Everyone in Sweetwater, Mississippi, expects the heroine Shiloh to marry Michael. But as fate or Cupid would have it, Billy and Shiloh fall in love. They have a tough fight ahead of them. Her father, his father (though Judge Sewell has never acknowledged Billy), and Michael all try through hook and crook to keep our cross-starred lovers apart.I discovered Lisa G. Brown's books through BILLY BOB WALKER GOT MARRIED in a bunch of used books I bought. I loved it so much that I acquired all three of her other books used (SLEEPING AT THE MAGNOLIA, CRAZY FOR LOVIN' YOU and HIGH STAKES which is written under the pen name Dana Warren Smith--all are out of print).

I kept seeing this title pop up again and again on the contemporary romance threads. So I obtained a used copy (it's out of print) and started reading. I won't rehash the plot, as others have already done that, I'll just jump right into my likes and dislikes. The very first thing to jump out at me was how very dated this book is. Billy Bob has a Billy Ray Cyrus type mullet. And because he's blond (the cover picture looks nothing like he's described) an unfortunate image of Joe Dirt, only taller, got stuck in my brain. Very hard for me to think of this backwoods, redneck type as really sexy. Since the author describes the styles of hair and clothes so well, the heroine was dated too. But this was written in 1993 and that's just what you have to put up with if you're going to read a contemporary this old. So, aside from that, I really didn't like the hero or heroine much. She was wishy-washy in the extreme about her feelings for him, and she was so naive in the ways of the world (even for a sheltered debutante) that it was almost laughable. 1993 was not an innocent time period! She was also very immature, but she was only 22 so I can cut her some slack there, it just got frustrating. Now for Billy Bob. This man is so full of pride and stubbornness that it seems like nothing gets through that thick skull of his. It made him seem petulant, immature, and whiny at times. It also resulted in some pretty high-handed, Neanderthal behavior. He expected her to be a virgin, even though he wasn't by any means. Some things were almost more suited to a historical. Again, I felt myself getting very frustrated with the whole thing. The book is long and the conflicts drag on too long.That being said, I still gave this book three stars. The author does a good job of bringing you into the setting of a small, backwoods, southern town. I liked the general premise, and she did manage to create a fair amount of chemistry between H/h. But the actual love scenes were a let down. I don't need graphic for a love scene to be steamy, but she made Judith McNaught and LaVyrle Spencer seem downright erotic! But the book kept me reading and I finished it pretty quick. There were some beautifully done, touching moments. All in all, this book was just okay. Which was a disappointment, considering the rave reviews I've heard. I probably won't be reading this one again."},{"Title":"Billy Bob Walker Got Married (Harper Monogram)","review":"This book oozes southern charm.

The author of this book sits firmly in the latter group, which begs the question, \\"Why did he write this?\\" He is quick to point out the faults of Dostoevsky's major works, but then trips over his words and arguments in meager attempts to describe the positive attributes. Indeed, if I were to base my opinion of Fyodor Mikhailovich and his works solely on this book, I would be quick to label him a neurotic right-wing nut job who couldn't write his way out of a paperbag. In short, if you're looking for a book that will help you better understand Dostoevsky and his works, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Dostoevsky in 90 Minutes (Great Writers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"A graceful, authoritative primer on the great Russian writer and thinker.

He's not Tolstoy, you won't float along in awe. He makes you work. He makes you deliver your own redemption. His novels are not full of pull quotes and famous single lines.

You know you're in trouble when, like me, you find yourself having a problem fully comprehending even the \`explanatory' preface. In which, by the way, Susan Sontag warns of the difficulty of the text and states that *Writing Degree Zero* serves as a kind of pr&eacute;cis of Barthes' early views that presupposes the reader's familiarity with the literary argument of the time, specifically as it was presented in Sartre's book on the subject *What is Literature?*That all said, there was still much that I found of interest in this slim volume. The main thrust of the argument seems to be the \`impossible' dilemma inherent in the act of writing. And, by \`writing,' we mean here the act at its highest level of intent. How, for instance, can the writer compose an authentic text when the very tools he's forced to use--the conventions of language and Literature--are those that belong to a tradition he had no part in choosing, let alone creating? How can he write a text socially and historically engaged in the present when this tradition is handed to him from the past? How can he avoid slipping into clich&eacute;, commercialism, and sloganistic propaganda, all pitfalls of the present, and yet still make himself understood and relevant to his time?Barthes makes much of the distinction between speaking and writing, the former more genuine than the latter in his view, inasmuch as speech is less bound by \`Order,' which is, by its very nature, always closed and authoritarian. Yet all attempts to convert the idiosyncratic, free-form rhythms and authenticity of speech into text ((as in the works of Celine)) remains, in the final analysis, when written, artifice.What's a writer to do? Barthes advances the notion of \`modes of writing,' a conscious attempt on the part of the writer to approach the act of writing by first choosing from among various strategies of presentation. He also speaks of a \`neutral' manner of writing, \`degree zero,' but he's quick to point out that this can also degenerate into a mere mannerism and, in its turn, become just another literary convention to escape. It seems to me that Barthes is saying that a writer is trapped, like a rat in a box, condemned to chasing its own tail. Perhaps the only possible escape is for a writer to constantly switch \`modes of writing,' to invent new ones for every utterance? Well, that's my own solution, but if Barthes thought it were as simple as that, you'd think he would have said so, right?Besides, what do I know? I think I was practically making up my own theories as I went along in trying to understand what I was reading.Abbreviated, dense, and elusive as it might be, as intellectually handicapped as I might be, *Writing Degree Zero* is so full of intriguing insights and lines of thought that even understanding maybe one-third of it, I felt it was time well spent. It has certainly inspired me to read further into the ideas of this paradoxical theoretician."},{"Title":"Writing degree zero;","review":"\\"Classical language is a bringer of euphoria because it is immediately social.\\" pg 49\\"This erect discourse [modern poetry esp.] is full of terror, that is to say, it relates man not to other man, but to the most inhuman images in Nature: heaven, hell, holiness, childhood, madness, pure matter, ect.\\"Barthes's sympathies appear to lie in classical over modern forms and modes of writing. He indicates in his analysis of modern poetry, that the Word remain hegemonic without being communicative itself--it being in essence an assertion of solipsistic individuality in reaction against the tyrannical inertia of Doxa. This line of thought is carried through to its conclusion (proletarian and petit bourgeois natured writings being two faces of the same Janus) especially in the sections \\"Triumph and Breakup of Writing\\" through \\"Writing and Revolution\\" and \\"Writing and Silence.\\"His conclusion: The Utopia of Language, Writing Degree Zero.Synthesis of the classical distribution of meaning applied to the whole language, and modern force of Words themselves, reigned back to their status of tools of communication: subordinate to their social use-their original and sole purpose (\\"instrumentality\\" in his words). see pg. 46 \\"a total gesture of intellection, that is, of communication.\\" A synthesis between the modern and classical, without the solipsism of the former or dogmatic adherence to Form in the latter.

An interesting, short read (88 pgs, including the intro)."},{"Title":"Writing degree zero;","review":"When Roland Barthes published WRITING DEGREE ZERO in 1953, he was determined to set out what he perceived to be the unique essence of writing. His task was made complex mostly because of a vastly differing version of writing offered by Sartre's WHAT IS LITERATURE? Sartre had insisted on a linking of form and content whereas Barthes upheld the dominance of form. Form making, Barthes urges relentlessly, is the primary goal of literature. The society and culture that forms the background against which one may write is bound to language in a literary bear hug that demands that the writer distinguish between form and content. It is only when they are linked in a Sartrean bonding that the previously hidden ideology surfaces, overwhelming both writing and intended content. The undesirable result is that a myth is engendered, one that imposes a patina of reality but is truly no more than a linguistic sleight of hand. Barthes describes such linking of form to content as a denial of history. What takes the place of history is a myth that the reader is required to recognize as literary legedermain. Sadly enough, Barthes muses, a reader is most often unable or unwilling to do so. The \\"Zero\\" of the title enters the picture when a writer creates a text that is free of the constraints and conventions of his predecessors all of whom may have had some very definite literary axes to grind. When a writer can neatly dodge the thicket of buried ideology to write a text that is unique, creative, and ideologically neutral, then that writer has assumed the much desired mantle of a zero degree writer. Barthes admits that this attempt is not a \\"one step and you're done\\" process; to create such a zero text requires ongoing struggle and constant experimentation with a myriad of writing modes. This is, of course, a writer's utopia. Barthes does not put matters as bluntly as that, but he implies that some writers have been successful at doing precisely that. He mentions Camus and Mallarme as examples of writers who at least once in their careers have created zero based texts. WRITING DEGREE ZERO emerges as a text that demands the highest of fidelity and erudition from the reader. Barthes' style and syntax is often arcane, abstruse, and highly allusional. Yet, for the reader who wants to know how myth has structured the world, often in unsuspecting ways, Barthes' \\"zero\\" thesis offers a convincing if obstacle-laden alternative."},{"Title":"Cyberforce Wildcats: Killer Instinct","review":"(Actually, this is not chapter 1, but the full story)Back in the early \`90s, Jim Lee and Marc Silvestri decided they were doing a good thing by cooking up a WildCATs/Cyberforce crossover, running through Cyberforce #1-3 and WildCATs #5-7, and collected in trade format as KILLER INSTINCT. Not that the crossover needed to occur, mind you, but with early Image, sales gimmicks and hype took precedence over any hint of quality. The main problem is that even with best-selling miniseries and regular issues under their belts, these two super-groups lacked the character development, history, and individuality necessary for an effective crossover. And no matter how strongly the creators felt otherwise, they absolutely could not write a decent story for their own characters.As a result, KILLER INSTINCT is an endless loop of fight scenes, melodrama, and horrid characterization, with little for the reader to take interest in. It centers around Misery, a villain with ties to the pasts of both the WildCATs and Cyberforce. The two groups meet, but instead of a team-up, it becomes an extended fight. Is this fight due to a valid reason? No, it's due to... MIND CONTROL (high up on the comic book cliche list). In addition, so-called heroes freak out and risk life and limb in response to an insult. Female characters recovering from injuries prance about in skimpy see-thru nightgowns. And, almost everyone has a bad attitude. One unintentionally funny aspect of the story is the liberal use of meaningless technical jargon and acronyms, the conception of which seems to have required more effort than the plot. If you are trying to fill in the backstory of WildCATs, be warned: there just ain't much here. You'll get a bit of info on the island of Gamorra, which plays a part in early issues of THE AUTHORITY, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Cyberforce Wildcats: Killer Instinct","review":"For those who remember the golden years of image comics remember one of the first crossovers of that genre, the wildcats were on a secret mission to Gamorra to investigate remaining Daemonite activity, instead they come across a femalenamed misery who posses a powerful telekensis in which she can manipulate any who crosses her path.To complcate matters the WILDCAT's team member Warblade shares a past with this beutiful and deadly woman, Cyberforce has also been lured into the fray and one of their team members Ripclaw shares the same connection with Misery as their past collide so do both team members when their locked into deadly combat with eachother under Misery's telepathic powers.This is a wonderful read for anyone who wants to recapture the fondness and the spirit of image comics...., the way it used to be."},{"Title":"Year from Monday: New lectures and writings","review":"Yes.The second collection of John Cage's writings to appear (after Silence), A year From Monday is indispensable to anyone wishing to have more than a passing understanding of Cage's work and thought. In usual Cage fashion, the lectures, essays, \\"diaries,\\" anecdotes, and assorted miscellanea jump off the page - utilizing an increasingly diverse array of typefaces and sizes, the writings contained here blaze the trail that leads to the mesostics and other verbal experiments that characterize the remainder of Cage's literary work beginning with M: Writings '67-'72.Including, amongst numerous other gems, the \\"Two Statements on Ives,\\" \\"26 Statements re Duchamp,\\" \\"Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas,\\" the \\"Julliard Lecture,\\" \\"Lecture on Commitment,\\" and a collection of personal reminiscences/Zen riddles entitled \\"How to Pass, Kick, Fall, and Run,\\" A Year From Monday contains an overflow of priceless Cageisms.Beginning with an unforgettable cover (three slightly-overlapping photos of Cage's face, the first serious, the second beginning to open up, the third in full cackle) and never slowing down, the collection demonstrates perfectly Cage's relevance to musicians firstly, and thinkers finally. From one of the most significant and influential composers of the 20th century, A year From Monday demonstrates the originality, openness, and precision of thought that make Cage relevant to a much broader audience than simply the avante-garde musician."},{"Title":"Year from Monday: New lectures and writings","review":"I find his book very interesting and informative in many ways. Most of it is very difficult to read because 1. John Cage is extremely intellectual, and 2. He is very avan garde, so some of the formats in which he writes in can be very complicated. I enjoy it being complicated though because there is something you can always figure out about it or just look into very closely. My favorite subject of this book are his journal/diary entries. They include entries of him away at master classes and the things that he talks about are humorous, great to know, and interesting to think about.

However, Palmer has done a good job of offering a broad selection, from religious founders to philosophers to writers to scientists to activists. The compilers are also well chosen, experts by and large. For instance J. Baird Callicott and Holmes Rolston III appear both as 'key thinkers' and as contributors.A particular strength of this collection of biographical essays is that is covers a much wider historical scope than many of the standard readers in environmental studies. Thus it goes some way towards setting more recent thinkers in their historical context. Also very helpful are the bibliographies appearing with each entry of the individual's 'major writings' and of recommended 'further reading'.A book of this sort succeeds if it gently makes readers aware of what they do not know, arouses their interest, makes them keen to explore further.

This novel is also important in its practicality, and that is not an attribute that most novels can claim, or a goal their Author's even set. The concept of a three way race for the Presidency is not only plausible, it is an event that has taken place several time in our nation's history. Had Mr. Perot not run his campaign in his, (I'm in, I'm out, just kidding, I'm back in, manner,) we may have experienced this book, not only a fascinating constitutional process, but the strongest test of the ethics and integrity of all involved. Even with his behavior charitably described as erratic, he received 19% of the votes cast in 1992. In round numbers that's about 20 million votes.But it is here that our method of electing our President, the only elected national office, becomes authored by Lewis Carroll. For then we are through the looking glass, and way down the rabbit hole, when the \\"Electoral College\\", a true form of alchemy appears. This sleight of hand turns the votes of 1 in 5 voters, 20 million people, into nothing more than a footnote. No one votes, represents, or speaks for 20 million people, so much for the idea of equality of a person's vote. Now any system this outrageously flawed, this bad, is not only dysfunctional, it is an affront to the Democracy we strive to be. The system allows for two outcomes that are not only absurdities, they contradict the whole concept of what a democratic election is supposed to be, whether a pure or simple form of Democracy.The Electoral College can, and has, placed a candidate that did not receive the most votes into the White House. What is even worse, and what has also occurred, is that the House of Representatives then decides the election by voting state by state. Like any piece of legislative voting the politicking begins, and whom you voted for may not matter, the candidate that voters said no to, can become, in fact, has become President. And in our hypothetical example regardless of how many Vice Presidential Candidates they are, only the two associated with the top 2 Presidential vote recipients can be considered, your right to chose has again been deleted. What should be untouchable is dismissed.There are countless books on the election process, and on The Electoral College. There are also studies that demonstrate that not all eligible voters understand the election method in detail. And as we have become a Nation that has a voting pool, the majority of whom do not participate, the power put in place in the best of circumstances is a minority decision. Only 43% of those who could vote did in the last Presidential Contest. And because the last 2 elections offered 3 candidates, the majority of the minority that did vote, cast their ballots for Bush and Perot. The majority did not want Clinton in office.The reason this book is so well done, and so important to read, is that Mr. Field has taken a topic that set in textbook form can be coma inducing, and wrapped a novel around it. The method would have been meaningless if the story was poor; it is anything but. Mr. Field knows the rules that choose who governs very well, the treat here is he presents the information in a very engaging format, that informs as it entertains. This is not to suggest the importance of the process is treated lightly, for no event would test Candidates and those that would choose the President, than an election where the general election failed to pick a winner.The scenario has always been divisive; it has never been tested in our contemporary times. When the scenario has arisen, History has been manipulated and changed. The Author gives an excellent lesson on how this has happened.So what would the politicians do once the ability to pick the President came down to the votes of 50 States, how would they conduct themselves with arguably the greatest power they would ever have? Would the Candidates refrain from using any influence to sway a vote, no matter how illegal, no matter that the laws of tampering with an electoral vote have never been tested.If the nation ever takes voting seriously again, two party elections could become a novelty. What if the 57% who have walked away are galvanized to participate, are they likely to join the existing parties who happily have, and would prefer to manage without them? These are questions that are without equal in their importance. This is the 21st Century and we still use a method for choosing our Country's Leader, and arguably the World's most influential leader, using an 18th Century System that does not work, that has never worked, that cannot work.This book is extremely readable, enjoyable, and as worthy of your time as any book you may choose to read.The best novel I have read this year? No. Enjoyable? Yes. One of the most important books I have read, and will continue to use as a reference source? Unconditionally!"},{"Title":"The Election","review":"The last legs of the 1999 Presidential election wore me out on politics, so I have been putting off reading this novel. I now realize that I could have overcome my boredom with the political process sooner by reading The Election: A Novel.As opposed to the usual manipulative politics for personal gain and campaign funds, The Election proposes a stark alternative: A principle-based candidate, Michael Edwards, who walks his talk. Needless to say, there are plenty of manipulative politicians and donors in this book, so you get the classic contrast of right versus wrong as the main story line.Edwards is a network news talking-head, so he knows how public opinion is formed. That experience causes him to be disgusted with presidential politics. With a successful business background, he also has ideas for improving the country that deserve the attention only a presidential campaign can provide.Another main theme of the novel is how the United States might be improved by stopping the prohibition on illegal drugs, and by focusing on renewable forms of energy and other raw materials. If you have never thought much about these issues, you will get plenty on both sides here to help you form your own opinion.Every compelling novel shares information that everyone wishes they had known before. What will probably intrigue you most about this novel is its considerable depth on little-known implications of the electoral college. That sounds dull, doesn't it? The strength of this novel is that these details are presented through fast-paced action. Between having gone to law school and viewing the recent presidential election, I thought I had the process all down pat. Mr. Field introduced me to several interesting twists and turns that I enjoyed. If you are like me, you will too.The novel's length in setting the stage is its main drawback. Like many novels, it begins slowly. You will, however, find yourself turning the pages rapidly after the first half. The action is rapid and compelling at that stage.The book's main value is in proposing a scenario for rising above party- and interest-based politics. I hope that idealistic people who would like to run for the presidency of the United States will examine this novel with care. They will get several good ideas for how to run a third-party candidacy that works. Many despair that there is no candidate flawless enough to survive that route. The novel makes an interesting case for dealing with that issue, as well.If you had to choose between following the last election and reading this novel, you would have done better to have ignored the last election and read The Election. The fact that we had so many disputes and they dragged on so long points out that politics-as-usual is breaking down. Why don't we replace our party-based sytem with something better that serves our needs?After reading this book, I hope you will reconsider your involvement in the political process. If you could advance a valuable idea, shouldn't you do so? Few people ever run for president of the United States, but most can run for school board, library board, or city council. Check into what needs doing better in your community. See if you can find a candidate who stands for making that improvement. If not, consider running yourself.May open debate about important ideas and the revealed truth from that debate set us all free!"},{"Title":"The Election","review":"'The Election' is an excellent read that captures the issues that need to be addressed today. If you enjoy a taught thriller, politics in general, or just want to learn more about the electoral system with out putting yourself to sleep, this book is for you.'The Election' focuses on a man who was become fed up with the stagnation in congress generated by our two party political system. The main character, Michael Edwards, has launched a third party candidacy that addresses relevant but unaddressed concerns of our society today. This book is a very interesting read for the plot line alone. Even beyond that, I found myself rumenating on the concepts brought to light. At times, you feel as if the author is intent of preaching a message - but when you stop to think about it - he makes a strong case.Whether you agree with his views or not, the book is an interesting and enjoyable read. The author has crafted the book to entice and maintain you interest throughout. Two items of note are that the book (1) casts light on serious issues that continue to go unaddressed in society today - being shrugged off and neglected because the eventual dire consequences can not be fully felt today, and (2) is a wonderful teaching tool to learn more about how the political process actually works. There is so much more that goes on with how a President is elected that the average person does not even realize!This book explores the wild possibilites of what could happen in the electoral process without sacrificing the enjoyment of an interesting plot line, and at the same time addresses significant issues that continue to elude our country's leaders due to the lack of common sense consensus between parties of what is good for the country as a whole.I would recommend this book to anyone. It works on multiple levels - whether you want a political thriller, to learn more about the election process, or are concerned about where our politics are leading, or rather not leading, our citizens today. Read it and contemplate the cost of inaction!"},{"Title":"The Election","review":"I have had the good fortune to read this book through the month of October, 2000. As I write this review on 19 November, several of the scenarios that I am pretty certain Mr. Field did not believe in his heart,in 1997, would happen suddenly are on the radarscope of our political life.I do not think this book succeeds as a novel per se, however, it was interesting enough to hold this reader until he got into the meat of what can happen in a freeswinging electoral process.The book is much more interesting than a dry text on electoral processes for the Presidency and in this it succeeds even as it imparts well-researched information.His Michael Edwards character also has a well-developed platform of mixed liberal and capitalistic ideas that bear looking into by some future candidate or, perhaps, even some current political powers.All-in-all it is a good read if one does not mind slogging through long speeches that enlarge on the subjects mentioned in my previous paragraph. The sexual content is, ummm, so-so and not titillating to an adult. The characters lack some depth and act in predictable convenience to the script too often. However, one must look beyond them to the core themes of the book and its educational value to those of us who daydreamed of real sexual encounters with our classmates in high school Civics class rather than listening to the course content."},{"Title":"The Election","review":"When I started to read this book at the same time our own election is going on, I was near election fatigue. However, I was pleasantly surprised about the book and very glad I did read it at this time.The Author revealed two things to me in this book. The first is he either has a great background in politics or knows how to research the subject matter to perfection. The second is he has the ability to make the political dull interesting by his own imagination of twists and turns in the book that are not expected. Either way it was a good read that is also provides great movie material.Thus, the book becomes a refreshing new concept about one of the worlds oldest conflicting topics known as politics.In the books main character, Michael Edwards, we see how he tries to change the system of politics at the same time the system starts to change him, a real reflection of today's political dilemma.Additionally, we see all of Michael's new ideas with his own money behind him running in direct conflict with the Electoral College controlled by the two parties. As Cecil Rhodes once said, &quot;Ideas Without Money Are Worthless.&quot; Well, not so in this book!The book details how scandals can be made from anyone's past, how dirty trick conspirators can target anyone seeking high office and how the media can destroy anyone's dreams of helping everyone just because of traditional ideology preferring the status quo which they are part of in a free society.In the book, I was left with an unique and ironic humorous outlook of cynicism much so I am after every election. Yet, the way the author does it makes it a must read that you will have trouble forgetting.The book may be a fortune telling for elections for the future. I highly recommend this book before and after any great election especially now!"},{"Title":"The Election","review":"The notion of a &quot;spine-tingler&quot; based upon the politicalminutiae surrounding a Presidential election is unusual, to be sure,and presents many possibilities in terms of character, plot, andideological theme. Richard Warren Field has taken the field ofcontemporary American electoral politics and woven an interesting,though not terribly well-written tale of a third party candidacy thatthrows the historically curious American Electoral College-basedelectoral system into a veritable tizzy. In presenting thehypothetical eco-leftist candidacy of one Michael Edwards, Field usesthe novel as a pulpit for the presentation of some interestingprogressive ideas, while simultaneously bringing to light some of the(many) flaws within the current electoral system. If he actually werea novelist instead of an earnest reformer trying to &quot;spread theword&quot; using a literary form that clearly is difficult for him,the book would be more of a success.In developing a&quot;page-turner&quot; about a hypothetical election, Field does hisbest to embellish his plot with suspense, skullduggery, and even onoccasion, sex. Once the halfway point in the novel is reached, thingsbegin to move along quickly and entertainingly, and indeed, the bookin its final stages is hard to put down. I also compliment Field forusing the novel as a kind of educational device regarding theElectoral College system and some other strange and often-arcaneaspects of the American approach to Presidential elections. Finally,some of the ideas his upstart candidate preaches in his campaign arenoble and interesting, particularly those regarding the desirabilityof moving our society in a more ecologically responsible direction.In light of the current threats posed by global warming and (again)soaring energy prices, the need for a renewed commitment to renewableenergy and a less materially gluttonous lifestyle has never been moreapparent.As a novel, however, *The Election* is not entirelysuccessful. First of all, the characters are oppressively shallow andwooden, and the narration lacks any real litarary nuance ordescriptive depth. The strength of the book is in its messages, notits style of presentation. Second, in order to make his &quot;thirdparty that catches fire&quot; theme at all plausible, Field needed tocreate a scenario in which the ecofriendly message of Michael Edwardswould suddenly seem significant enough to cause people to abandon the&quot;lesser of two evils&quot; mindset that has kept the vastmajority of voters attached to the two-party system for decades.Americans certainly are supportive overall of environmentalprotection, but from all indications, ecological issues simply are notamong the most significant issues that influence people's votes. Thatthey could become so is certainly possible, but it would require somekind of threat or crisis (and likely one that includes a body count),and Field does not present any such scenario that would move &quot;theenvironment&quot; to the top of people's electoralagenda....Overall, I salute Mr. Field for his dedication topossible significant change through the electoral system, and Irecommend the book to anyone who has ever fantasized about an electionshocker that would bring an eco-friendly administration into power.The cynic in me finds his scenario insufficiently plausible, butcertainly Field's heart is in the right place.

I should state at the outset that political novels are not usually on my reading list; the last one I read was &quot;Primary Colors.&quot; I must say, however, that, the minutiae of counting votes notwithstanding, I enjoyed it. The main premise of the book is the third-party run for the American presidency by preeminent news anchor Michael Edwards. As with many other characters in this book, I found myself wondering whether he was based on Tom Brokaw, or Dan Rather, or perhaps Peter Jennings. As the race heats up and Edwards's candidacy gains both credibility and momentum, there are sub-plots of character assassination, outright assassination, pay-offs, intimidation, and the buying of electoral votes. What struck me most profoundly was the author's assessment of modern &quot;sound-bite elections.&quot; It's so true -- the American public tends to elect the candidate who is poised, prepped, knows how to deflect the tough questions, and sounds good on TV.

Field has come up with a Constitutionally accurate, healthily cynical and very exciting story about just such a situation.I kept waiting for the big implausible shocker to spice up the story, the event that would be totally unrealistic but would make the story more exciting (the sort of thing a publisher would shove down an author's throat, in other words), and it never came. Well done, because the story is already interesting enough and doesn't need to stretch credibility to hold the reader. The portrayal of the American electorate and its sound-bite oriented, mercurial nature--and the impact of the news media upon that nature--certainly square with what I've seen in elections past and present. Character development is generally good and balanced, with no total saints and few total villains. The third-party candidate's platform is sufficiently convincing that I'd like to see a real candidate espouse the same ideas. The ending is cleverly done and stands a good chance of taking you by surprise. It did me.One caveat: if you order it, before you start reading, remove the dust jacket and set it aside without examining it. The back of it, if read before the book, will basically ruin it with a list of irritating plot spoilers for which I'm not sure of the rationale. Happily, this is easily remedied.Well worth reading as a political novel, a look at political science in general, and perhaps as a tool for insight into why so many political campaigns develop a shady side."},{"Title":"The Election","review":"Written in 1997 this book is relevant today.

Best of all was the extended Election Night sequence, written hour-by-hour as the returns came in. The author's story of a credible third party presidential candidacy is a page-turner, and brings up important questions about the perils of the Electoral College. However, Field spends far too much time promoting his own agenda, which is a sort of New Age progressivism, heavily reliant on alternative energy, vegetarianism, and drug legalization. No matter what one thinks of these views, a serious political analyst would know that they are anathema to most voters. The fact that the candidate's campaign is reborn when he announces he supports legalizing drugs is simply implausible. If you love close elections, read it for the campaign, and skip over the speeches. You won't be missing much."},{"Title":"The Election","review":"After getting this book in the mail, I was fully prepared to dislikeit wholeheartedly.... in the end, I found that I wasn't able to put itdown....This is a book that seems meant to be a popular novel;unfortunately, having been published by a small press and, at times,not crafted like a popular novel, it fails in it's purpose. Theediting in places is bad (or the typesetting), throwing off charactersnames (on pp. 378, a man talks and answers himself erroneously....);when the author makes attempts to use sex to titillate, it seemsstilted; characters seem flat and cliched.

As with many other characters in this book, I found myself wondering whether he was based on Tom Brokaw, or Dan Rather, or perhaps Peter Jennings. As the race heats up and Edwards's candidacy gains both credibility and momentum, there are sub-plots of character assassination, outright assassination, pay-offs, intimidation, and the buying of electoral votes. What struck me most profoundly was the author's assessment of modern &quot;sound-bite elections.&quot; It's so true -- the American public tends to elect the candidate who is poised, prepped, knows how to deflect the tough questions, and sounds good on TV. Perish the thought of electing a real person who calls them as he sees them and lets out an occasional epithet. This is a fun, thought provoking book to read in this election year."},{"Title":"The Election","review":"It does not compare to Hemingway or Annie Dillard, but it caught me enough to sit in the bathtub and read for two hours in order to finish it.I'll start with the weaknesses: it read like a bestseller, shallow but entertaining in places. The author's voice emerged too clearly through the quick summaries of characters better left describing themselves through their actions. The romantic elements meant to be spicy were tepid, the mandatory violent minidramas rather stock. The candidate's ideas were sold as a huge novelty; many were not, although I appreciated them and the speeches made for them were clever. I'm not economist enough to know whether tax breaks could encourage that much innovation.(Note to author if he should read this: pro assassins tend not to dine with their employers. Trust me on this. Very often the real pros never meet or even talk with those who use their services. Nor do they case important speeches personally, let alone do the killing themselves. They hire fanatics, one reason the Secret Service employed consulting psychologists to filter through crowds looking for certain expressions, gestures, etc. Given equipment that can register physiological changes at a distance, I don't know whether they still do.)On the plus side, the plot moved well, the hero seemed noble, the suspense suspended, the sideswipes at attack ads and big-party business-as-usual were accurate and delightful to read, and we got to see exactly what might happen should a third-party man of honesty and integrity decide to try for the American Presidency.Part of the tension involved Edwards' weakness for picking rather sneaky campaign supporters--&quot;beauty pageant operators,&quot; as his wife, the book's voice of reality, tells him. He should have listened to her. A candidate who agrees to be &quot;imaged&quot; and &quot;packaged&quot; in a certain manner violates his commitment to be honest to his constituents. Nothing is less honest than manipulative, mass-appeal advertising. Edwards believes it is necessary, and for a good cause...but where have we heard that before? Even the devil has ideals. Edwards is no devil, but he doesn't realize that playing with words and perceptions is contrary to the democratic spirit and in the end will undermine the &quot;will of the people&quot; our current game-show-host-leaders keep referring to. (You know, the ones we're Gored by and Bushed with....)A moment of increased honesty emerges when his wife tells him that he loves the admiration. He does. But his willingness to compromise opens a weakness in his shining armor wide enough for shadowy people to show up--exemplifying, in psychological terms, the shadows cast by every idealistic leader who fails to take his own narcissism and sleight-of-hand into full account. In that Edwards is no different from the candidates and conmen he looks down on, the Als who twang their words in the Deep South and the Georges who thump the &quot;family values&quot; bible, except in this: he is willing to deal squarely with the resulting consequences and unwilling to smear his competitors or cover up his flaws. &quot;It's not whether you win,&quot; he tells a supporter he fires for unsavory tactics, &quot;but HOW you win.&quot; Or how you lose, for losing with integrity is no defeat.This book speaks of the need to believe--to believe things CAN be better, that good leadership and beneficial public programs ARE possible. But if fundamental change is to come to the American people, I don't think it will begin with either politics or economic reform. However inspiring, an Edwards wouldn't convince as many mainstream voters as he does. That hurt the book's believability a bit for me.For instance, take the Electoral College, which receives some attention by the author. The College was set up as a check on mobocracy, on a blind majority overrunning the fragile procedures of a new government. But it was created in a vastly different age, in which a far smaller country was run largely by white Protestant males. Despite all the changes and diversifications and expansions since then, however, the College remains. Why? Because no one smart or charismatic enough has gotten into politics and done away with it? No. Because it dilutes the vote. Those who lead know very well that putting more weight on electoral votes than popular votes convinces big sectors of the public not to vote at all. And they know who benefits from that. Blatant gerrymandering could not be so effective.What's crucial about this is that we put up with it, just as we put up with sloganizing and mud-slinging and a well-panned focus on appearances. We allow extraverted boys pretending to be men to hold power. We listen and nod our heads when the Democrats tell us what we want to hear while the Republicans tell us what we wanted to hear fifty years ago. (The only real difference between the two is that the former wants the government to act like a parent and the latter wants parents to act like the government.) We put up with it because as they make fools of themselves in the places of power, we realize at some level that the majority of us behave similarly, if less spectacularly, in our own hearts and homes. We are the leaders we complain about, writ small.Into a nation in which money and appearance are everything and actors and athletes are treated like saints, a brutal, &quot;well, that's business&quot; nation of which Thoreau wrote, &quot;The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,&quot; comes a real leader, a mature man who refuses to act like a boy and who refuses to entertain us. We wouldn't vote for him, the majority of us, we'd laugh him off the stage, out of fear, shame--and envy. We're safe with buffoons and cynics. Whereas true idealists unwilling to sell out their idealism...well...But it doesn't have to be that way!An Edwards in the political sphere would help. But what we really require to relocate our greatness as a people is to be more of an Edwards in our personal conduct."},{"Title":"A Day in the Life of Murphy (Bccb Blue Ribbon Picture Book Awards (Awards))","review":"We LOVE this book.Even my husband, who is NOT a dog person, loves this book.Most important, of course, my 2 and a half year old loves it.

It's the story of a woman who bicycles her way into a Nazi concentration camp, is saved from death by some Quaker ambulance volunteers and is eventually plunged into a bizarre situation in an isolated Native American village in New Mexico.What makes De Hartog's writing especially interesting is his ability to dig deep into the psyche of this woman, who suffered an unbearable trauma but keeps going using mental tricks that we can recognize in our own lives or in people who come our way.In addition, every time you think you have this woman or the story line figured out, the plot goes off in a direction you never expected, not at all typical of novels published in 1979.It seems ironic that Amazon is selling this book for one cent when it is so much better than most novels you come across... talk about a bargain!John J. Pint"},{"Title":"The lamb's war","review":"I can hardly believe this book was written by the same man who wrote The Peaceable Kingdom. It started out interestingly enough but quickly declined into complete and utter drivel. I did finish it, but only because I had taken the unusual (for me) step of actually BUYING it, but when I had come to the end, I put it in the trash, not wanting to inflict it on anyone else."},{"Title":"The Keys Of Hell","review":"The Keys of Hell was very shallow when it came to charicter development. The action was good and the discriptions of events were good, but beyond that there was nothing. It seems like he's trying to just write another book like another essay for a high schooler, not putting any thought into it and just focusing on the basics. Higgins is capable of a lot better, as shown with the Flight of Eagles. Two stars for plot and discription of events, and nothing else."},{"Title":"The Keys Of Hell","review":"The reason I titled this review &quot;Confusion&quot; was due to the fact that I am perplexed about how whenever I read a book from a new author, it is one of his lesser accomplishments. I know Jack Higgins is a great and successful author, but I am going to say I did not enjoy this book. It wasn't written poorly, but due to its paper-thin storyline, I wasn't impressed. The story is just a giant flashback. It begins with a group of Italians reviewing Paul Chavasse's file, and they are impressed by one of his missions. Higgins' then stretches this thin plot through 250 pages. Personally, I would've rather read the summary in Chavasse's file than have read &quot;The Keys of Hell.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Keys Of Hell","review":"The book starts off just like another book written by the author - only different names are used. The scenario, however is very much the same as one of Sean's novels. I like Higgins' books and have gone back and purchased every one in the Sean Dillon series. I felt cheated with this book when I noticed the Locations (pages?) only went to 2168 instead of >5000. It's more like the short stories that I pay 0.99 for. Anyway, it was a decent read if you don't have anything else to do but I felt like I was re-reading a book previously written for other characters."},{"Title":"The Keys Of Hell","review":"Jack Higgins has certainly given us another of his high-powered action thrillers. The pace is so quick, the plot twists like a snake, the writing is taut and to the point. All good things.However, even though the characters are likeable, they are not parituclarly developed. That, I feel, is often Higgins's letdown. He gets so wrapped up in the action that he forgets to give his characters deep personalities. Instead, we just see snapshots of people who, really, could be any hero from any thriller novel. All he really does is gives his characters names and then inserts those names into the story. The characters are just there to keep the plot moving along. The problem is that practically all the people in this novel are interchangeable with those of another. For example, Chevasse shares almost exactly the same personality traits as Sean Dillon. As does Liri, who is Jack Higgins's typical lead woman. they are all the same, in all his novels. Their names and pasts just change.That said, this is still a very good book. The pace never lets up, it's a pageturner and it's quick. If you like a good action thriller and don't particulalry mind about characters, then this is the book for you.

A first rate thriller by the author of The Eagle Has Landed."},{"Title":"The Keys Of Hell","review":"There's an Albanian proverb that is quoted in the beginning of this book that says that there are no keys to hell, that the doors are open to all men. Well, someone here left the doors open all right, but left the lights out. Don't get me wrong, Jack Higgins is one of the grand old men of suspense. Anyone who has ever read \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" or some of his other novels under the Harry Patterson monicker (\\"The Valhalla Exchange\\" comes to mind) knows whereof what I speak. But here, Sir Jack seems to be just writing on automatic pilot.The premise is there: The search for a legendary religious icon, the Madonna of Scutari. It's just that Higgins never completely drives home the point as to why agent provacateur Paul Chavasse would want to pursue this quest. Is it because the girl he almost put the moves on at a party is involved or does he actually care about religious resurrgence in Albania? Remember, when he's not saving Brittania, this guy also deals with Mafia dons.Higgins, still the master at characterization and action (hence the two stars), does leave part of his thought process on the perverbial floor. While in the fog, Chavasse has the drop put on him by a couple of the bad guys. He's told to stand very still while he is checked for weapons and then he is instructed to \\"walk straight ahead and don't look round\\". As he is told by his captor that it would \\"desolate\\" him to kill him, it's only then that Chavasse realizes that his captor is speaking Albanian. Only then, Paul?"},{"Title":"The Keys Of Hell","review":"The Keys of Hell was originally published in the 60s when Jack Higgins seemed to pump out the thrillers by the truckload under 14 different psuedonymns.

He makes the point that scripture must mean to us what it meant to its author and his original readers. For example the popular verse &quot;Beloved I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health&quot; was merely John's personal wish for Gaius. That is what it meant then and so what right has anyone to suggest it means anything different today. Gordon Fee also examines healing and whether or not it is part of the Atonement.Gordon Fee is charismatic and starts of the book almost apologetically.I think this book brings balance to the body of Christ and I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"The disease of the health & wealth gospels","review":"This is a tremendous little book. Gordon Fee is a world-class New Testament scholar and a Pentecostal. He discusses the &quot;theology&quot; of the health and wealth teachers and preachers and how they take Scripture out of context. With all the imbalances and biblical distortions going on in the Pentecostal/charismatic scene today, Dr. Fee's book is refreshing and much-needed.Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"The disease of the health & wealth gospels","review":"This is a review of the 2006 45-page Regent College Publishing edition. I've read many of the critiques of the so-called \\"Word of Faith\\" movement, but only recently read Fee's informative booklet on the topic which is comprised of three articles (not chapters): The 'Gospel' of Prosperity, The 'Gospel' of Perfect Health, and the New Testament View of Wealth and Possessions. I wish I read it sooner since it considers the broader biblical context for the topics of health and prosperity that is lacking in some longer critiques. For the record, Fee doesn't use the phrase \\"Word of Faith\\" to describe what he calls the \\"perfect health\\" and \\"wealth\\" or \\"prosperity\\" gospel(s), although most of the names he briefly refers to (Oral Roberts, Kenneth & Gloria Copeland, Kenneth Hagin [misspelled 'Hagen']), and the examples of biblical eisegesis he gives, fall within the Word of Faith movement. Fee mentions Robert Schuller in his first article on prosperity, but Schuller more appropriately falls within, or on the fringes of, the broader New Thought movement as does his mentor, Norman Vincent Peale. This movement along with Christian Science - which some conservative Christians call \\"mind science cults\\" - also have a health and wealth emphasis but vary widely in their understandings of the Bible, God, Jesus Christ, and salvation. Much of what Fee says also applies to them.Since Fee is a Pentecostal, Assemblies of God minister who believes in the miraculous gifts of healing for today, he is careful when combating the distorted understanding of the topic. He also refers to the A/G's position paper on healing when discussing the doctrine that healing is available through Christ's atonement. Although I think he has many valuable, and correct, things to say regarding healing, I think he fails to solidly address the underlying concern of many Christians regarding healing as it relates to God's goodness and love for all. He ends his article on The 'Gospel' of Perfect Health by asserting that \\"the first sentence of a sound biblical theology may well be, God must do nothing\\" because \\"He is sovereign in all things and is simply not under our control.\\" But this doesn't negate the belief that God MUST be and do only good. In some sensitive minds this translates - rightly or wrongly - to some healing (physical and spiritual) being available through faith to all who know the truth this side of death because \\"God is no respecter of persons\\".Regarding prosperity and \\"selfishness\\", I think Fee could have balanced some of what he says with some of the teachings of John Piper. In his article on The 'Gospel' of Prosperity Fee quotes Gustav Aulen who, in part, asserted: \\"Every attempt to transform Christian faith into a religion of satisfaction and enjoyment is thereby doomed to failure. Egocentricity masquerading in the robes of religion is excluded.\\" But, according to Piper's Christian 'hedonism', \\"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\\" God is glorified in satisfying human needs! Also, in his third article on the New Testament View of Wealth and Possessions, Fee rightly and scripturally points out the dangers of wealth and the value of contentment whatever the circumstances, but this doesn't negate the concept of prosperity as a contented, liberated mindset that can, through financial intelligence, produce wealth for the purpose of meeting physical needs and even funding Christian ministries and socially beneficial organizations. Having said all that, I want to again emphasize the value of this booklet and recommend it highly.Regarding the title of my review, see the second article where Fee notes that Paul confronted the false theology among the Corinthians who \\"rejected Paul and his theology of the cross (with its ongoing suffering in the present age)\\" preferring a 'glorious' Jesus to Paul's 'crucified Messiah'. Fee says: \\"For the Corinthians that's like saying 'fried ice.' Messiah means power, glory, miracles; crucifixion means weakness, shame, suffering.\\" See the article for more details. In my opinion, and I think Fee would agree, what the contemporary church lacks is a biblical, Christ-centered and liberating theology of suffering (I recommend, for starters, reading Piper's chapter on Suffering: The Sacrifice of Christian Hedonism in his 2003 edition of Desiring God)."},{"Title":"The disease of the health & wealth gospels","review":"Fee is a solid scholar and Pentecostal.

In the first chapter, Fee takes on the teachings of Kenneth Copeland, Oral Roberts, Robert Schuler, . . . but especially Copeland. Chapters one and two are aware of each other and two bookends. Chapter three seems like a later rewrite of chapter one with the names taken out, etc. Notwithstanding, and despite the fact that it would have been better had we had Fee's thoughts on these matters smoothly and concisely worked out, this book is still valuable. They represent a compilation of thought from a supreme NT exegete, whose theology on these matters, even if a bit redundant, provides helpful, biblical correction to a distorted American message on wealth and health.

There's enough exposition in BLOOD PROPHET that reading the first book isn't essential, but for a fantastic and imaginative read I recommend starting with THE BLOOD OF KINGS.As much as I loved the first book, with its vampire plot entwined with revelations about actual significant gay figures in history, I found its sequel even more compelling. Once again we're thrust into the world of Jamie Dunn, an immortal sired by the ancient Danilo, who depends on the blood of kings for his continued existence. Through his narrative, author John Michael Curlovich helps us imagine the possibilities of a culture not steeped in a guilt-ridden, life-denying reactionary worldview exemplified by religious zealotry. Though the plot is a complete fantasy, the author is able to convey the reality that this worldview corrupts and destroys everything it touches. Using the idiom of gay identity to illustrate his point-and I'll point out that both the heroes and the villains are gay, so this isn't a story about poor put-upon gays being victimized by conspiring straights-the author creates a credible, though fanciful, case for the ubiquitous homophobia of religious conservatives, and the value and empowerment of Pride.While the author clearly has more on his mind than just spinning a good horror yarn, it's obvious that the first order of business for this novel is to be entertaining. And what a good time it is! The exposition moves quickly, and the whole thing is so fast paced I read the entire book sitting out in the sun this past Saturday afternoon.

THERE WILL BE SPOILERS! NOT OF THIS NOVEL, BUT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE!********It's been two years since twenty-one year old college student and pianist Jamie Dunn's lover, mentor, teacher, spiritual advisor, and \\"sire\\" Danilo Semenkaru has disappeared. Jamie has now become a fixture at West Penn, and his Chopin fixation continues unabated as he continues to study classical music. Especially the compositions of past masters that were gay, and of \\"Royal Blood\\".Jamie is now starting to perform live, and to meet a whole new cast of characters. One of which is the traditional and Christian composer Lazar Perske, whose music bores Jamie, but to whom he gravitates to in the hope that Perske will help him in building his composition skills.Another is the sixteen year old Adam Pilarski who has run away from home after being constantly abused by his fundamentalist Christian parents. Adam sees beauty and inspiration in Jamie's music and inspirations.He also meets Paul Koerner, a student and singer in the music department. First briefly and professionally; he sings something for one of Jamie's recitals. Then the professional relationship becomes personal as the two will become lovers and confidants.After two years, Jamie's life suddenly starts to get interesting again. The murders that plagued the campus two years before, and were the result of Danilo and Jamie feeding, start again, although this time Jamie is not responsible. In fact, the murdered are usually connected in some way to Jamie.Then Adam is murdered in an act of religious fervor by his parents and his parent's congregation. Jamie is heartbroken, and vengeance is mine sayeth Jamie, and the results ain't pretty.Jamie also becomes the focus of a Christian sect hellbent on censoring Jamie and everything that he does. Jamie's father-figure, and music teacher, Roland MacTavish, warns him of their building influence but Jamie just shrugs the warnings off. This will come back to haunt him, as the group's leader will turn out to be somebody that will betray Jamie's trust.The events, and murders, continue to escalate. Somebody murders his estranged step-family and after settling their affairs, he finds that he has been willed his biological father's diaries. They will be stolen, but the damage is done. He finds out a closeted secret about his father, that his father was ritually murdered, as Jamie murders those he feeds on, and who the murderer is. The murderer is the person that has been sabotaging his life, and is the person that is responsible for his lover's disappearance.Then Paul talks him into participating in a Ouija board session as conducted by this novel's token woman, Joe \\"Josephine\\" Maggio. During which the skeptical Jamie experiences an extreme vision, an extreme stigmatic experience, and is told where Danilo is. And we are then off to the races.You don't have had to read the first novel \\"The Blood Of Kings\\" to read \\"Blood Prophet\\", but it helps, especially as there is much about Jamie that is simple not explained in this novel. Jamie has been informed that almost all gays can trace their bloodline back to the earliest pharaohs. This makes certain gays of \\"Royal Blood\\", who, then when turned, into a form of superman. This also gives them them right to prey, to keep themselves healthy and young, on other gays. While billed as a vampire novel, this is really a serial killing, vampire and cannibalistic, paranormal romance. Yes, Jamie drinks blood, but only usually before ripping out other men's throats, cutting out their eyes, heart, and genitals for consumption.Again, as like the first book, in this alternate world there are almost no non-gay men, unless they show up to be small-minded gay-bashers, and there are NO women. All great historical figures, including Jesus Christ, (yes, there will be blasphemy) in culture, politics, music and the like are gay, and all historians have conspired to keep these facts from you. And this constant droning on about this just gets tiresome and predictable. And once again, Curlovich speculates that if you have a problem with pedophilia or incest, it's you that have a hang-up and a problem with real sexuality, not gays of the Royal Blood for whom such things should be considered beautiful and natural. In love with a teen-ager? Try the Royal Blood defense in court and see how far that gets you.There are no transsexuals, and if there any bi-sexuals, they are lumped in with those that refuse to be open with their sexuality, and true to their homosexuality, and therefore are to be considered cattle to be slaughtered. Jamie is especially hypocritical, as at one point in the novel he says that he is fighting for those who can't come out into the open, yet it is these that Jamie feeds upon. In fact, Jamie is just a pretentious git as he commits multiple murders, but acts as if the rest of us are just one bad smell that he has to endure to live here. He justifies his boorishness through his \\"Royal Blood\\" theory. And after eight years of incompetent leadership under the Bush regime, haven't we all just grown tired of this type of self-serving and delusional self-appointed royalty? Also there is a vague whiff of racism here as all the gay men are either Caucasian, or of Egyptian heritage, none are Latin, African-American, or Asian. And almost all the men are beautiful.On the other hand, by ignoring contemporary politics, music, culture, and current events Curlovich's \\"Blood Prophet\\" takes on a timeless feel that will allow it to be read by anybody. This novel's plot has more twists and turns, therefore making it more of a thriller than the previous novel \\"The Blood Of Kings\\".On the downside, and no pun intended, but the typo fairy has really gone hog wild here. At one point Jamie says \\"I smirk a thim\\". A \\"thim\\"? What is a \\"thim\\"? Do I have one? Or then there is this gem \\". . .not its uszzzzzzzzual brilliant blue.\\" WTF?!?There was also meant to be a third novel in this series I think. There are a number of plot holes that are never filled. Primary amongst these is that a tall, dark and somber figure comes up to Jamie and tells him that Danilo has left him behind to watch over Jamie. We NEVER find out who this character is. Even so, most major plot threads are tied up, and the Royal Blood mythos is kinda fascinating. This novel also continues Curlovich's fascination with ancient Egypt. Something that can also find in his thematically linked Egyptian trilogy [\\"Cities Of The Dead\\" (1988), \\"The Colors Of Hell\\" (1990), & \\"The Mummy: Dark Resurrection\\" (2007)] that he wrote under the Michael Paine name.For this site I have reviewed the previous novel in the Jamie Dunn series:The Blood of Kings: A Noveland his three thematically linked Egyptian novels:Cities of the DeadThe Colors of HellThe Mummy: Dark Resurrectionand these other books as by Michael Paine or as himself:The Night SchoolOwl LightStage FrightSteel GhostsTriptych of Terror: Three Chilling Tales by the Masters of Gay Horror"},{"Title":"Women, Earth, and Creator Spirit (Madeleva Lecture in Spirituality)","review":"Women, Earth, and Creator Spirit is an awesome way for readers to rethink and examine their traditioanl views on God.

The Red Cross report and other valid reports are in the book so that the reader can see for himself that the torture at Abu Ghraib was certainly far more than a few rotten apples that were military police serving in the reserves that were sent to Abu Ghraib.There was sadism at Abu Ghraib. There was a breakdown in law and order at Abu Ghraib. There was a breakdown in discipline at Abu Ghraib. This, of course, puts our entire Country and our entire military at risk.Not only is the torture wrong, but, beyond that, torture is ineffective and many of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib had no intelligence value in the first place.

For the numbers of people detained and tortured in the War on Terror-- many of them believed by reputable individuals and organizations to be innocent-- continues to rise, and extends far beyond Abu Ghraib. The very fact that the majority of these people have never been formally charged with involvement in terrorist activity nor tried seems to prove their innocence, for it would be very easy to keep someone in jail these days if one could present solid evidence of their involvment in terrorism. Those who object that the tortures inflicted on these detaninees is not as bad as that which some totalitarian governments inflict upon their victims ignore the fact that the \\"soft torture\\" techniques in development since the end of World War II have been found to be more effective in \\"breaking\\" victims than simple brutality (see Alfred McCoy, A QUESTION OF TORTURE: CIA INTERROGATION FROM THE COLD WAR TO THE WAR ON TERROR). The suffering of these wretched detainees keeps me awake at night, yet to this day most people seem unconcerned about their plight. Danner's comment from the Introduction to his book still holds true: \\"Like other scandals that have erupted during the Iraq War and the war on terror, it is not about revelation or disclosure but about the failure, once wrongdoing is disclosed, of politicians, officials, the press, and, ultimately, citizens to act.\\""},{"Title":"Torture and Truth: America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror","review":"Like its companion, The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib, Torture and Truth is an essential resource for scholars or researchers on this subject.

Mark Danner's \\"Torture and Truth\\" deserves separate consideration. The book is a singular reference for the academic or historian who will try to make sense of an age when Americans acted out of fear instead of strength and confidence, and became the world's bully instead of its protector. As such, this is not for the reader who wants to be entertained. The detailed memoranda that describe intradepartmental and interdepartmental conflict will prevent that, so will the myriad of abbreviations and acronyms that will make the reader turn to the appendix again and again. A few readers will be lucky enough to know what sigint, UCMJ or CSM mean without seeking clarification, but the constant turn to the appendix will cause frustration and disrupt the continuity of reading.What becomes apparent is that torture was considered even before we started taking prisoners or that there was \\"actionable intelligence\\" to be gained from them. Colin Powel's State Department sends a flurry of memoranda attempting to convince the Bush administration to act within the rules of the Geneva Convention. The Departments of Justice and Defense, the Office of Legal Counsel, and Bush's own lawyer write the opposite. The forces against Powell are strong. Afghanistan is declared a failed state, the Geneva Convention will be observed but not practiced, and torture is given such a narrow definition as to allow almost any practice short of permanent injury or death.What doesn't need to be looked at in detail are the pictures of Americans acting as barbarians. It is obvious from the photographs that they were not seeking intelligence information by sitting on top of nude prisoners, torturing them in hallways, putting them on a leash, making one prisoner fellate another, stacking them nude, in human pyramids, or tying them to beds or cell doors while they were also nude. Smiling faces of American women over an Iraqi corpse may sicken the viewer almost as much as seeing the hooded man, standing on a box, believing that electrodes are clipped to his fingers. These are photos of Americans as einsatzgrppe.The sworn statements from prisoners and the February 2004 Report of the International Red Cross show a pattern of brutality in too many facilities to be considered isolated incidents committed by \\"bad apples.\\" \\"Certain Coalition Forces military intelligence officers told the ICRC that in their estimate between 70% and 90%of the persons deprived of their liberty in Iraq had been arrested by mistake.\\"The Taguba, Fay, and Schlessinger Investigations point to a lack of leadership, command and control, logistics, training, and continuity to explain the mayhem that resulted, but no investigation is aimed at the decision-makers in Washington. Prisoners are not taken to the rear as doctrine called for because the rising insurgency means there is no rear and no central point to process detainees who exchange number and identification with each other. Soldiers operating under the dilemma of using harsh techniques to provide intelligence and act humanely were given no moral compass by leadership or command and control. In other words, who was in charge? Those who were well-led, knew SOP and policy acted professionally. Some officers, NCO's and enlisted men made it their mission to act professionally, but only some.The U. S. does not plan for combat operations in Iraq to end as quickly as it does. It expects to turn over Iraq to a sycophant who turns out to be a double agent. The U. S. doesn't, and stays. Neither event is planned for. The administration is unprepared for an occupation, an occupation that has no front line, plenty of time for things to turn for the worse, and not enough troops to handle it when it does.It is also apparent that America had come full circle since 1945. It had become the invader instead of the liberator. It had become the brute and the bully instead of the protector. It now leads other nations through domination and coercion, instead of by example and cooperation.This book was written in 2004.

Among Christians (and dare I say prevalent in seminaries) the question of whether we can really know and be certain of any one truth has recieved a sickening \\"no\\". Ecumenism has uprooted our confidence in standing firm on absolute truth, and postmodernism has thus seeped into all of our hearts, using a very convincing argument that because there are so many interpretations, perspectives, cultural theologies, etc., there surely can't be ONE true, distinct, clear answer for everyone. We have been convinced that it is arrogant to claim that we actually KNOW something for sure. The church has been stripped naked and is standing embarrassed before the world, too afraid to say anything too dogmatically.Mark Thompson is willing to argue that the church has been fed a lie and that the aforementioned argument is fallacious and misleading. Thompson is an erudite scholar, not afraid of reading and citing everyone on every side. If he had left the book at the first chapter, he would have convinced the reader that the postmodern view has won, and that it would be naive of us to think otherwise; that is how well he cites the opposing view. He is not afraid to be honest which in my mind is true scholarship. Notwithstanding, he argues later in a most forceful way and takes a position that may very well end his publishability in the academic/intellectual world, simply because he is willing to take the heat from academia and humbly say that Scripture actually IS clear. Today this is academic suicide.He introduces the book with the view that scripture is unclear and that to know something for sure as we read the Bible is arrogance. He cites all of the major authors on the subject, and is overly fair with their argumentation.He then argues that God is a clear God. God chose to reveal Himself which meant that He wanted to communicate. Being a clear God, He communicated Himself to us clearly. He is also not a confused God, meaning that He does not reveal Himself with hopes that interpreters of the Bible will find their own distinct truths as they read, some of which contradict others. No, He communicates clearly and is not confused but offers one possible interpretaion only.The opponent then says that God is clear but we are not. Our language is weak, our minds are weak, and therefore our interpretations are weak and we must throw in the towel of understanding Him clearly. Thompson's answer is that man did not create language, God did. God did not choose a \\"weak vehicle\\" called language to communicate Himself, knowing that we would never understand anyway. No, He created language and He chose and was able to communicate clearly through it. To say that scripture is unclear is to tell God He did a poor job.Thompson also argues that postmoderns go too far in saying that Scripture is unclear as a whole. There are not as many \\"difficult\\" passages as they claim. On the whole, the Bible is very clear and people agree on it. It is the \\"difficult\\" passages which recieve so much attention that we've been convinced the entire Bible is \\"difficult\\". So the oponent then argues that \\"difficult\\" passages means \\"unclear\\" passages. Thompson is not unaware that there are passages over which very good Bible students disagree. But he concludes that simply because it's difficult does not mean that it is unclear. It means we continue to work hard at determining the truth. He supports this by demonstrating that Jesus and Paul argued from the clarity of scripture by pointing out the misinterpretations of the Pharisees. They would not argue this way if they felt scripture was unclear. It took work for them to study the scripture and then to expose misinterpretations. Jesus and Paul and any NT author for that matter inherently believe in the clarity of scripture merely by the way they cite the OT continually.His arguments are biblical, they are humble, they are well informed and they must be considered by anyone who thinks that we cannot know anything for sure. God revealed Himself with a \\"Clear and Present Word\\"."},{"Title":"A Clear and Present Word: The Clarity of Scripture (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Mark Thompson has contributed the latest volume to this excellent series on the clarity (or \`perspicuity') of scripture, and he analyses the issue with thoughtfulness, clear headedness and insight.Thompson's thoughtfulness is shown in the historical perspective he gives, from the early church, mediaeval writers and the Reformation, as well as more recent times. He shows the contemporary relevance of the Reformers' debates with the Catholic Church over whether tradition and reason are necessary guides to reading an unclear scripture, and how we to be captive neither to a fundamentalism which denies the need for scholarship, nor a scholasticism which denies the need for faith.The clear headedness is shown in his handling of Scripture. He is concerned to show that although perspicuity has frequently been attacked as an unbiblical imposition on the Bible, that is a misreading of both the explicit claims of scripture, and the implicit assumptions built into the way that biblical authors handle other biblical texts. By far the most important, of course, are Jesus' own assumptions, and that is summarised very helpfully.The insightfulness is evident in the elegant way Thompson steers through contemporary thinking on hermeneutics, showing not just obvious perils, but more subtle and spiritual ones as well. Careful readers will be aware how much work has gone in so that we don't just avoid the massive and anti-Christian errors of Derrida or Ricaeur, but are appreciatively nuanced with regard to Karl Barth, John Webster and Alister McGrath. This part of the book is a master-class in how to make the obscurities of contemporary linguistic philosophy both accessible and relevant.This issue is of particularly pressing concern for those of us who are Episcopalians, like Thompson himself. The Primates meeting in Dar es Salaam, called for a \\"Hermeneutics Project\\", which looks like a dangerously open-ended concept. It might just be a reminder that we need to revisit the Biblical material dealing with homosexuality and check our interpretation once again. That is a good and necessary task, and is the kind of self correction which evangelicals should continually engage in. However, I and I guess many others suspect that this project is actually an exercise in how to find a way of reinterpreting texts, such that the liberals can be seen to be engaging in a theological task, whilst rewriting scripture and tradition. Hermeneutics has then become a linguistic game, a typically ironic post-modern way of playing with words so that an alleged authoritative text is made to stand on its hind legs and dance to an alien tune. Mark Thompson's book will encourage us that we can engage in this kind of debate and win it, the Lord being our helper, because we are dealing with \\"the hermeneutic of a clear text in the hands of a good God\\" (p.140). But he would warn us as well that this is not a neutral matter of language and interpretation, but a spiritual battle with the one who is a liar and the father of lies."},{"Title":"Ornamental Horticulture: Science, Operations & Management","review":"This is a great book, I have it because it is used as a textbook for my Introduction to Horticulture class.

McCarthy made a lengthy speech(constantly interrupted)in the Senate,highly critical of the military and diplomatic career of General George C. Marshall(and other \\"public servants\\")during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.The reaction from many quarters to this speech was one of indignant outrage.In questioning the wisdom-indeed the very loyalty to the US-of Marshall,revered and sanctified as the \\"Organizer of victory\\" during World War 2,even Senator McCarthy's allies(such as Republican party chief Robert Taft),felt Joe may have gone too far.To this day,it is McCarthy's \\"attack\\" on Marshall-Army chief,roving diplomat for Truman,Secretary of State and Defence Secretary-which is pointed to as being the \\"red-hunting\\" Senator's greatest political crime.This book,published in 1951,is basically a condensed version of McCarthy's speech,with some additional material.Whether McCarthy was wholly responsible for writing the speech/book-or if,as some believe,it is largely the work of one of his more academic assistants,such as J.B. Matthews,is debatable.Be that as it may,whoever has(like me)been informed by our \\"media\\" for decades that McCarthy's public attack on Marshall was a prime example of Joe's unholy wickedness,may have to revise their opinion after reading this book.The case made against Marshall,his proteges and advisors,is carefully argued,well supported by evidence-and devastating!Drawing on published memoirs by the politicians,military figures and such who were involved in the momentous events in which Marshall played a leading part,one is staggered by the scope of the indictment against him,and sobered by the thought of the other horrors which would have occured if Marshall(and others discussed here)had managed to get their way all the time(instead of just a lot of the time!).Here we see Marshall's murky role in the Japan/Pearl harbour debacle,his monomania about opening a \\"Second front\\"-at a time when neither the US or the Britain could have mounted an assault on Nazi held Western Europe without colossal casualties and inevitable failure,solely to take the pressure off Stalin's forces in Russia(Stalin having been until very recently Hitler's ally and fellow plunderer of Europe);his sabotaging of the efforts of Churchill and others who were trying to prevent Russia occupying swathes of eastern europe and taking Berlin;his moves to see that Russia was brought into the war in the east(a strengthening of Stalin's hand quite unnecessary to the Allied war on Japan);his insistence on there being a land invasion of Japan(then defeated militarily,without supplies-as its Navy had gone-and suing for peace with the Allies)which would have seen massive needless loss of life among Allied servicemen;his role in ensuring Stalin got the territory he craved during behind the scenes manoevering at the big conferences like Tehran and Yalta;his willingness to forward the cause of Mao and his communist rebels at the expense of the Nationalist regime which led to decades of the Chairman's gory incompetent rule over China(turning it into an impoverished charnel house).Anyone reading the indictment here will probably begin to wonder how on earth Marshall gained such a reputation as a sagacious guardian of the US and the free world's interests,and why he was thought of so highly by clever political operators like FDR,Truman and Eisenhower.Is this the story of a naive serial blunderer,whose errors were somehow turned into epics of reasoned statesmanship by a fawning gullible left/liberal media and political establishment-or were all these activities(which promoted the aims and ends of Stalin)coldly calculated and deliberate.We have the evidence from the previously secret US and Soviet intelligence archives that the infiltration into the power structure of the US by Soviet agents and fellow travelling allies was on a quite breathtaking scale in the 30's and 40's.Much more still remains locked in the archives of the Soviet intelligence services.There is uncontrovertable evidence that many of those previously declared by the \\"liberal consensus\\" to have been innocent victims of unscrupulous political witch hunters like McCarthy and the Un-American Activities Committee-from Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White to the Rosenbergs-were in fact guilty as charged all along.Joe McCarthy came close to calling Marshall a traitor.Dwight Eisenhower,who coasted to prominence on Marshall's coat-tails,never forgave McCarthy for attacking his old mentor-it was one of the reasons why,as President,Ike finally joined the pack who were out to get the Junior Senator from Wisconsin,and helped destroy him politically during the 1954 Army Hearings and their aftermath.Reading this book will help any impartial reader decide who was right about George Catlett Marshall."},{"Title":"America's retreat from victory: The story of George Catlett Marshall","review":"What an important book!

It's not a New Age book, in that the author does not teach that everything that happens to us stems from our conscious attitudes and intentions. He presents very good evidence as to why affirmations and will power don't work. His thesis is that you cannot create what you desire in life until you change the underlying structures that make your life what it currently is. Changing those structures does not have to do with problem solving either. It has to do with figuring out what you do want (harder than it sounds) and then using the creative process to set in motion the forces to accomplish whatever that is.Fritz is a professional musician with a clear understanding of the artistic process. However, he takes this process well beyond the arts and applies it to life in general. He has worked with groups who have used these principles in foreign aid projects and business; he's also worked with individuals who have changed their personal and professional lives for the better. The point is that creativity is not just for artists--it's a human concern. If we all understood how to create rather than to just react to what life throws at us, the world would be a happier place. This is a hopeful, inspiring which should benefit anyone wanting to live a well-crafted life."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"Many of us realize that our lives are driven by certain learned patterns of behavior and thinking. This little treasure helps us to identify those patterns that we fall into unconsciously on a daily basis. It brings them into consciousness, where we can alter them and transform our lives. These old patterns form deep groves into our minds (the path of least resistance), which we too easily fall back into--unless something comes along to form a new, powerful and more effective pattern. Examples and analogies abound here, from the creation of musical compositions to manifesting the ideal job for you. It is practical and yet touches something at a deeply spiritual and creative level.This book is not for the feeble-minded. Read it slowly and let your psyche absorb it with pleasure. If you have the resources to commit to reading and comprehending it, it will change your life. Are you concerned about the environment? Are you worried about something else going on in the world or in your life? Listen to me-- after you read this book you will view and be able to act upon ANY global or personal &quot;problem&quot; in a new and more powerful way! I'm not kidding. Our thoughts and words have so much power! Our patterns of thoughts and words can create a world we only dreamed about before. This book is magical. This book shows us how to be responsible for the state of our lives and the condition of the world around us. It teaches us how to own our personal power."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"The Path of Least Resistance is an awesome piece of work. It's a \\"manual\\" that belongs to the product of YOU the instant you learn how to read.We do exist to create, you know. In one of his books, inspirational author Alan Cohen has a chapter named: Create or Die.If you think this is just a specifically focused book of techniques for artists on ways of being \\"creative\\", such as brainstorming and doesn't apply to your life as a bus driver, or a waitress, or a doctor, you're wrong. We ALL create, everything from good relationships, to successful meeting outcomes, to careers, and yes... music and paintings and inventions and sculptures and books. As a matter of fact, Fritz eschews the notion of brainstorming and you'll see why in this book.Basically, the first thought that'll crowd your mind as you complete the first chapter and then the second chatper, is that you have to read this repeatedly, because you want to soak these very profound, life-changing ideas into your psyche. It was hard for me to concentrate on the rest of the book during my first reading, because I was so excited about the implications of my expected change in thinking, and how I would tell others. What you'll learn is that being a reacter to problems doesn't result in peace of mind or success long-term. There are actual laws that he cites which explain the Structure of Tension which causes you to let go of all struggle and be powerfully pullled toward completion of ANYthing you want to accomplish.In this book, he tells when you think of a goal, that you need to separate what your brainwashed mind think what is impossible, from what you reallly want. You'll see that the stress of repeatedly lying to yourself throughout your life about what you want can slowly but surely impact your health even! If you set goals that are based on what your fears tell you that you are limited to, but not what you *really want*, this wears on you physically.Forget what your current environment or conditions tell you. THOSE DON'T MATTER! Just change to another \\"Structure\\" which leads to creation, not one that will swing you back and forth between struggles to fixing a problem, then...aaallllllmost getting there, but then the rubber band of the \\"Reactive\\" Structure pulls you back toward giving up on your faulty \\"fix-your-exterior\\" behaviors.Fritz mentions that he studied Metaphysics in his life, but wasn't much interested in them; however, this topic can't avoided, and you'll see how when you are in the correct Structure of Creating, and you simply make a decision to create something, that this sets powerful acts of force in your favor. Between sessions of actually working on your project, like walking the dog or taking a shower, your subsconscious goes to work and pulls from the collective conscious of Man EXACTLY what you need to create what you decided to create. He includes this in the examples, but not in the way I'm describing it. Don't worry, he doesn't write with the scatter-brained style of this review. You'll get it, and you'll be grateful for his simple four-step guide to CreatingOne more thing: Fritz discounts all self-help techniques such as affirmations or long term therapies. Personally, things like EFT and the Release Technique have been a godsend to my ability to function in interviews lately, and to eliminate strong negative emotions in some encounters.But I see what he's talking about with respect to focusing more on just being the Creative Being that you were meant to be, rather then making your life into one long Saga of long term therapy-seeking and inner-child healing."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I treasure this book. I first read this book when it came out 10 years ago. I have read it a total of 4 times now. It is a truly remarkable book because it relates the creative process to the physical laws of nature to which we are all subject. This is the path of least resistance, along which all energy including creative energy will flow. It takes a while to understand the writing. It is not a self help or quick fix book. It is not a book on descipline or willpower. It is a book that explains how to change the underlying structure of your life to create the life you want. It must be understood both intellectually and experientially as you practice examining your current situation at the same time you hold the vision you want to create. Robert Fritz does a wonderful job of using very simple examples to demonstrate the dynamics of the &quot;least resistance&quot; principle."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"This book has changed my life. In a world where it's so damn easy to lose yourself to outside influences like alcohol, drugs, sex, materialism, etc., I've finally found the one book that has brought me back to my original purpose - creating my own life, rather than relying on circumstances to tell me what to do. It showed me HOW to find it again, and it's amazingly simple, as all things should be. It just requires making a choice to be the creator of your own life, as God intended. I'm still reading it, and I will always refer back to it when I lose inspiration. I'd like to give everyone a copy of this book, but of course, one has to be ready to receive it. This book is the difference between confusion and clarity, depression and happiness. I am back on track and full of ideas and inspiration, thanks to Robert Fritz's teachings."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"The essence of the book is: decide for yourself what it is you want to CREATE in your life (work, family, lesure, etc.), objectively assess your current reality, and leverage the structural tension that comes from the discrepancy between your desired and current reality.The Robert Fritz approach holds a lot of appeal: focus on what you want, or want to create, and frame it as a vision that ignores the extent to which it is actually possible to achieve the vision. In view of this, &quot;I want to create a world in which everyone is well-fed&quot; is a legitimate vision.Another appealing aspect of thinking 'structurally' is that it urges us to think in what I would refer to as &quot;constructive terms&quot;, without falling into the trap of being unduly optimistic, or blind to reality: for example, rather than adopting the vision of &quot;I want to lose weight&quot; or &quot;I no longer want to smoke&quot;, Fritz invites us to say: &quot;I want, and I choose, to have good health&quot;. In this way, the structures that hold us back are removed from our consciousness.Structures elicit behaviour, in this model. Oscillating structures are those that cause us to vacillate between conflicting goals (e.g. oscillating between the desire to lose weight and the desire|need to eat), and usually get nowhere.I see the Fritz approach as entailing the adoption of certain attitudes and practices. It is a matter of disciplining oneself to leverage one's innate desire to create, regardless of the way one earns a living. The book provides lots of examples of how artists create their work, but Fritz reminds us that the same principles can and should apply as well to, say, business managers and school teachers.I am very glad to have read this book. I believe that it has already begun to influence how i see my future and my choices. Fritz offers a constructive way to draw out, shape and frame one's aspirations for one's life. The principles as laid out in the book are surprisingly simple and logical once they've had a few days to sink in, and yet so many of us allow ourselves to oscillate and prevaricate amid 'no-win' structures of which we are not even conscious."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"If you haven't read Robert Fritz' Path of Least Resistance, do so right away.I first read this book in 1987 when it had a profound impact on my life. I was lucky to meet the Fritzes around 1992, and that already deep impact was made more so. This book is about applying gap analysis to your life. Simply put (very simply): decide where you want to go, look at where you are, and really understand - at a deep level - the distance between them. Use that distance, or difference - what Fritz calls \\"structural tension\\" to propel - to motivate your life. When the gap between where you are and what you want closes, you lose the motive force; at that point you have to stretch again, reaching for new goals, new heights, new stars.Fritz offers you rich detailed steps for creating; establishing your vision, refining your goals, and how to take action. In my book this is highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"Too many authors are second hand imitators, who simply mimic what has gone before ... this is why we have a gush of positive thinking books, which is what I expected this book to be ... &quot;boy! was I wrong.&quot;What I loved about this book was it's originality, plus the fact that it has nothing to do with positive thinking. In fact it goes as far as debunking most positive thinking approaches as self-delusional... Fritz demonstrates what all creators have in common and how we can all become creators and forward essence movers.This book is non-technical and very easy to understand, I got so excited about it's concepts that I was urged to assimilate them immediately.I actually grasped what Fritz was getting after finishing the first chapter ... and it was a profound moment like a hundred light bulbs had been switched on in my head.This book is more than good it is groundbreaking ... if I was asked to put it on a list of all the self-improvement books I have ever read (and I have read many) I would have no hesitation at putting it in the number one position."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"At one time, only a select few people in the world were literate, but now most people in the world are literate.Today, only a select few know the structure and processes of creation, but thanks to Bob Fritz that too will change, and maybe one day the world will be peopled by creators, which, in my view, is what God intended when he created us in his (or her) image. Creativity and the creative process used to be thought of in nebulous terms, as if it were always by happenstance, or the presence of some otherworldly muse, that gave rise to creative manifestations.In the &quot;Path of Least Resistance&quot;, Fritz cuts through all this, and shows us exactly how it is done. I have been manifesting visions ever since I read the book and took his seminar, which, I might add, was much more intense and meaningful than the other classes I was attending at Harvard, concurrently.I am ebullient to see that he has written other books, and I will not hesitate to buy and study them all. I am also excited to see that he has collaborated with Peter Senge on some his works, and I'd love to see a collaboration with Haj Ross and Todd Siler in future, but will only toss that out, and try not to envision it too strongly, as I would not want to be guilty of what Fritz calls &quot;manipulation&quot;... which is where you include specific people in your visions -- which can thwart the outcome and actually have negative effects all around.This book, and indeed Fritz' work, is a veritable bible, or how-to book for visionaries, seers, sages, creators, artists, musicians, students, and anyone who wants to finally get what they truly want in their lives.Don't let vague processes impede your goals and visions. Buy this book and learn how to create the world you want... with the least resistance. I can think of no better place to start.Dave Beckwith, Pres.IdeaConsultantsCharlotteInternet.com"},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I participated in Robert Fritz' DMA course way back when. It was the only so-called \\"transformational\\" course which not only resulted in clear and very specific accomplished goals, but which also explained how and why those goals were achieved. The years had faded my memory of the theory and techniques, although they had not faded the shock I felt when, after two weeks' work (about 20 minutes a day), the very specific event I was focused on was accomplished. So I bought this book as a refresher.Fritz does not disappoint. He explains, with great clarity, why we experience life as a series of \\"one step forward, one or two steps back,\\" what's wrong with the way we view life that makes that happen, and steps to creating a new way of living your life. It's all deceptively simple, but often the simplest ideas are the most profound.The book suffers from a writing style that's dry as dirt. It sometimes interfered with my ability to really grasp the material. That said, it's also very easy to understand and avoids the goofy jargon of most self-help or \\"transformational\\" books.Overall, it's a really valuable book for anyone who would like to learn how to \\"create\\" your life, as opposed to suffering through it."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I did'nt understand what did tried to tell me. very complicated and i am not new to creating reality. do not buy"},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"This slim book offers powerful insights for those who have contemplated or struggled with questions of so-called \\"self sabotage\\" and the other ways that we tend to undercut our ability to succeed.In reading it, I had the feeling I already knew much of what he said, but the clarity and directness with which he explains his principles was *huge* in helping me understand my own process for creating - and further than that, what has happened (i.e., gone awry!) in my business and my life.If you've ever had ideas and desires that you haven't quite been able to bring to fruition, read this book; it will almost certainly help clarify what's been going on and what you might need to do differently.However, it's important to note that although Fritz's book is subtitled \\"learning to become the creative force in your own life,\\" this isn't quite accurate. This book is a wonderful introduction to Fritz's work - which has spanned decades and is a mature process - but it's not a how-to by any means.For that, you'll want to read his third book, \\"Your Life as Art.\\""},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I've read many books on personal success, but never have I read a book that explains the science of it all.Once you finish Robert Fritz's \\"The Path of Least Resistance\\" you will have a Master's Degree in life, creation, success, fulfillment.

Some of his topics are: reality is not an enemy; it is important to make conscious choices; it is more effective to choose what you want rather than avoid what you don't want. What I appreciated most in this book was the section on making fundamental choices. Examples of fundamental choices: freedom; to be true to yourself; to be healthy.

Due to his obvious lack of education in disciplines like psychology, psyhotherapy, philosophy or theory of knowledge, he tries to explain everything with one simplistic metaphor: structure (which is everything - from building to desires to music) brings out results (=movements/changes of the structure, which is... everything, every change, from changing political systems, to growing a tree) thanks to path of least resistance (which is....yes, everything - any explaining ingredient staying behind the scene).His structural metaphor has everything what weak explaining constructs can have - it is too general, inconclusive, overall, all-encompassing, truistic, not moving any further in concrete understanding or practical testing. Yes, I agree, the methods he describes can be good. But not because of the \\"theory\\" (because his \\"theory\\" explains - anyway - everything), but because they are well proved methods used by many other coaches/therapists etc, used long before this book was published.The book is practically the same like writing the book based on groundbreaking theory \\"everything is fight between two polarities\\" or \\"everything has start and end\\". I am very disappointed, especially after having read many positive reviews here. Still, it pretends to be highly scientific with passages like \\"Structural conflict may be defined as two or more tension-resolution systems in which the points of resolution are mutually exclusive.\\" Mein Gott! Although I have intellectual background, I like many books in the area of folk psychology, popular psychology, written in concise, down-to-earth, practical language. This is not the case.

It is as good as \\"Creating\\" by the same author. It is inspiring and instructive. I cannot say enough that's good about this book. I admired all the things he wrote about, I remember, including his views on democracy, about Gertrude Stein and Robert Frost on the creative process. Robert Frost's views on creativity here is one of the most thorough I had encountered to date. There is also a great deal of realism in Robert Fritz's assessment of the creative process. He makes discovery and creativity exciting because real, not romantic. I admired his views on individuality and individuation, a revolutionary idea now, more than 20 years later, when put in contrast to today's growing, insidious collectivism.Robert Fritz criticizes New Age religions and philosophies. He goes to the core of all doubt and finds resolution. The book is vast, covering so much, it's difficult to talk about specifics or details.

There simply isn't enough time to do everything.On this subject I recently read a book which I think gives a very clear approach on how to find an answer to this big question.This book first describes the fundamentals on creativity and how they affect your everyday live. A lot of different definitions go around, and allmost everybody seems to have their own interpretation on what creativity actually is.Robert Frits provides a very clear and distinctive definition on what creativity is, and what it is not.After that he comes up with the \`tension seeks resolution' model which explains why it is so difficult to \`stick to the plan' when you want to change something in your life. Most of the time you are trying to actively chang your every day behaviour, after some time a lot of people seem to fall back to their old behaviour.This model is then used as a basis for the \`creative process' that can be used for making lasting changes to your life in a way that it makes you feel happy and energetic.The book is very well written and has a good information density.

You see, this book isn't for people who are thinking about becoming creative -- looking for some prescription for creativity. NO. It is a deep analysis of what happens to you as you create. By raising your consciousness about such issues as tension and resolution (in writing and performing any of the arts) you become more aware of the process of flow, and how it applies to just about everything you do, everything you involve yourself in, and most importantly, everything you create.

At times, the reading gets a little tedious, as this not merely a description of the steps in a &quot;process&quot; but rather an excellent attempt to elucidate the very original concepts that the author is trying to expound. Even so, this treatise on the principles of the creative &quot;FORCE&quot; is highly readable and leaves the reader feeling that he has gained understanding and insight into an area that appears seeminly elusive..."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I bought and read this book ten years ago. Practising its principles helped me complete my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. It is useful to read over and over again. Each time it yields new insights."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"This is one of those books that can change your life and the world around you. You can look at the book in two ways: towards the positive ideas it contains which contain the seeds for a revolution in the way we relate to the world and the way we conduct our lives, or critically, in which case you can identify some flaws such as his theories of structure in relation to the dynamic agent which need some work.One of the great strengths of the book is it is a practical, results-oriented book. While it outlines its position clearly, it is not intended as a finely wrought edifice of theory. This in fact might be one of the fundamental insights of the book: the distinction between doing, and theorizing. The book, through an emphasis on doing and creating, manages to fit in activities such as theorizing neatly and organically into part of an ongoing creative process geared towards achieving the results you want in your life.That said, it is one of the few books I would recommend as important reads to anyone interested in the areas of personal development and development of society around them. Like any book, it shouldn't be taken on board too literally, but digested and assessed one bit at a time - and then tried out in practice to see if you agree and it works for you. Then you can write the next one!"},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I found this book to be very slow reading. It was not hard to read, but rather it had many deep concepts that required thought and pondering. I underlined the book heavily and plan on handing it out to friends.His discussion of structure, and the overall concepts of following the path of least resistance, were excellent."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I love this book especially the information on how we are conditioned to choose from a reactive unconscious posture and how to choose consciously.

Now all researchers have to do is do their job to take this further, just as Einstein's laws were conceived in his mind and were pure theory at first, while it took some time before they were really prooven.In my own life I have been creating like he is describing, but he has made thing so much more clear for me. To read and use this book is pure joy."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"This book is only for people who want to create but feel helpless about themselves. At times, the author is so long-winded that I felt like saying to him, please get to the point!I'm not convince about his theory since there are no experiments to prove that it is true but I'm sure the methods he advocates works. How can they not work when the bottom line is know what you want and go all out to get it without fearing to take the risks, make sacrifices, feel the pain, sufferings involved in the process of getting the thing you want - don't think of the process, just want it and you will naturally know what to do to get it because it is the path of least resistance in getting the thing that you want.It doesn't guide you on how to get from where you are to where you want to be, it just says you will know how to get there when you have decided on what you truly want. It doesn't even guide you to know what you truly want. As it doesn't touch on ethics and morals at all, the methods can be misused by people who have evil intentions and want to create mischief.The author sounds arrogant at times when he proclaims &quot;How can there be an end to purpose in a world in which there is so much to create?&quot;. He obviously thinks that the meaning of life is to create. Environmentalists will be annoyed with him because it is humans' wanton creations that are depleting the earth of its natural resources and causing other life forms to become extinct.Some sentences sound as if they are mocking other beliefs. For example, he says &quot;I would like to see these great enlightened souls stick around for a while and make music or paint or write poetry. Perhaps if they did, they might like it here a little better.&quot; These great enlightened souls referred to people who believe in karma and that life is about suffering.The examples in the book are mainly on creation of music and paintings and very few on scientific inventions. His advice of start with nothing doesn't seem to be what scientific inventions are about. As we know, new physic theories are often built on older ones. Scientists often used the phrase &quot;on the shoulders of giants&quot; meaning they work in the light and achievements of those before them.For people who want to get out of their helpless state, this book may be it. There's nothing here for people who are already creators or those who have no interests in creating.All in all, this is just another new-age self-help guide trying to make the big leap into the corporate world by posing as a scientific revelation."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"fritz really has no value for mainsteam psycho therapy but his alternative &quot;structure&quot; of changing your life isn't very well presented. he get's bogged down in his structure schematics and after a while I lost interest.

I see many small effects on a daily basis, and am hopeful that these changes will lead to larger manifestations in my life. People around me are commenting that I seem so much happier.

The inherent turth of Mr. Fritz' premise, that we can choose to be the predominate creative force in our lives and that what we choose to do or not do can and does influence what comes next immediately resonated with me. Our lives follow a path of least resistance and we can choose to \\"create\\" our lives ... by making intentional and deliberate choices that encourage the intended result we can create the lives to which we aspire. I immediately \\"got it.\\"I also immediately ordered two companion books by Mr. Fritz and am now reading them. I am finding similar inspiration, insights, and information."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"Upon first glance you might think that this book is just another typical self-help book, but it is actually much more than that. You might think that what the author discusses, that you need to determine what you want and decide upon the steps is overly simplistic, and you might be oversimplifying it.Fritz is first and foremost and artist. He is a musician and composer and his work deals with his analysis of structures, which are often hidden from plain view. Why do you do the things you do? It is often because you are moving along the easiest path, one which you or others may have constructed for yourself, but not necessarily one you would have thought about.You can think of it this way. If you are like most people, it takes 20 - 30 days to form a new habit. At first it is easier for you to stay where you are, and it will take effort to overcome the resistance. However if your goal, desire, etc. is to achieve the result, then you will shift your internal structure to where it is easier to do the steps to achieve the goal.Like a recipe however, if you are not clear on the steps or the results, you may wander off track. You really need to focus on the outcome you are trying to create.This is the essence of the artistic process, the one that professional creators use to achieve their results. This process can be learned and put in place to achieve whatever outcomes you desire.The catch is, more often than not once you start achieving, you may slack off and fall back into your old structural pattern.A worthwhile read. I re-read my copy at least once a year and each time I find new insights as I have grown since my last reading.Highly recommended for you.Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"This is one of the most beautiful, profound, and enlightening books I've ever read.

They have been builders. They have been creators.\\" ~ Robert Fritz from \\"The Path of Least Resistance\\"The theme of Robert Fritz' brilliant book, \\"The Path of Least Resistance\\" can be summed up in three words: \\"Structure determines behavior.\\"Like you, before reading the book I had no idea what the heck that meant. Nor did I have any idea what \\"structural conflict\\" vs. \\"structural tension\\" was all about--let alone why creating structural tension is the core attribute of creative genius.As you gain an understanding of how structure determines behavior, you'll also gain a sense for why Fritz believes affirmations and willpower and all that other \\"positive thinking\\" stuff will never give you sustainable creative powers.For that? We need a whole new structure. And that's what Fritz great book helps us create."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I found this book in the laundry room of my apartment building where people sometimes leave old books and magazines for others... and I'm wondering why they threw it out with all the other business books they dumped there!It is very interesting to read, though like many such books is a bit long-winded. It confirmed to me that my approach as a scientist and scholar is the correct one, the one most likely to lead to good science. A professor at my previous university in Australia kept pushing the view that we needed to solve &quot;clients&quot; problems (my field is environmental studies/science). This was at the top research university in the country. This guy was just an extreme example of the tendency both in that country and Britain (less so in the US). I knew he was wrong, that that wasn't a way to do good science. Fritz's book confirms that solving problems is rarely satisfactory in the long-term, and instead we should focus on what we want to create. If you are doing that in a field that has relevance to important social issues, solutions to people's problems will emerge as a by-product. Also that artists and great scientists do art or science primarily for the love of the thing that they create. Other motives are secondary. I know that when you are truly creative one project develops out of the previous one which is another key point he makes. His description of the artistic creative process also seems very accurate for the typical scientific project.So in summary this is a really great book that gets it right!"},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"I just finished The Path of Least Resistance and it took me about a month to read it. My own life experience as a creator tells me that all of the ideas found in this book are 100% valid - but the idea of structural tension that the author uses as the basis of creating is somewhat abstract and it takes a while to wrap your head around it. I think this is because his language is that of a musician, and a composer, and the way he uses some of the general terms of creation are rooted in a musical understanding. Without this shared understanding, I found myself rereading many passages to see which terms and words were derailing my understanding of his arguments - and kind of piecing the arguments together in my head more slowly than I am used to doing.In some ways, I actually wish I had read the book from the back to the front, because I much more easily understood all of his concepts once I got to the second half of the book - and the last chapter in general locked in everything for me. This was an unusual book in that regard. I've read the other reviews that felt his writing was stiff and such, and maybe it pertains to some of what I've described above.Analyzing this book from my understanding of the Law of Attraction was the best way I could pull all of his arguments together in one cohesive workable framework. In Law of Attraction terms every thought, belief, or structure of thoughts and beliefs produces either the vibration of \\"the having of something\\" or the \\"not having.\\"Fritz describes two creative structures in his book. The first is the \\"destructive\\" reactive/responsive. The second is the Creators structure. In Law of Attraction terms the way Fritz describes reactive/responsive thought structures - these are built around a focus on \\"not having\\" the producing of a stream of results that creates \\"not having\\" experiences...and a path of least resistance that always leads to more of the same. The second structure, the Creators structure, is built on \\"the having\\" of something. Living your life within this structure you are BEING \\"the having\\" and your life leads you reliably to \\"having\\" experiences, thoughts, people, events, etc.What is unique about Fritz's material is his analysis of the structure of the lives lived by people who focus on \\"not having\\". This analysis of \\"reactive/responsive\\" modes of living is a very good mirror to hold up to your life to understand what the structure of your life actually is.The book is weak on examples which bring both structures and their results to life. This is surprising, given that the author has built a business around teaching this material...and has probably had 1000s of interactions and examples to draw upon. On the other hand, Fritz is a conceptual thinker - and much more at home with the idea framework than the people aspect, that seems pretty clear to me.The how-to portion of this book is remarkably short and I won't give it away, as this would be a disservice to the author. But in and of itself, I found the how-to core of the book to be a very elegant structure that is easy to use and apply. Interestingly, on one level, this is a book that inspires faith in the universe and teaches you how to use it moment by moment. I believe this is its atonishing contribution to the literature of creation.The structure of \\"the creator\\" ultimately relies on allowing Source Energy to contribute it's part to the creative process. This is not only 100% consistant with The Law of Attraction information, but it is easily proved in everyday living. The author's techniques for using it are quite elegant, but they may not work for everyone - especially people who are unaware of their emotional reality. He does specifically cover this in his book. But either he has a blind spot in his thinking - or is not willing to reveal his techniques for \\"accurately assessing where you are\\" or is unaware of how he intuitively does this for himself and others. So if you are a grounded person who understands the emotional content of your own thoughts and can see reality clearly - this book is worth reading and can be effective for you.But if you constantly find yourself swinging on an emotional roller coaster and experiencing emotions like anger, despair, revenge, pessimism, doubt and complete lack of faith - you'd be better off reading the Astonishing Power of Emotions first.The Astonishing Power of Emotions: Let Your Feelings Be Your Guideand understanding this component of creation before you dig into this book.Another way of saying this is: Had I not spent the last year immersed in the Law of Attraction information I would have been fascinated by this book, but I would have been unable to use the how-to portion of it successfully. But with this as background - I could get and use the author's information and deeply appreciate it.Having said all of that - I just purchased Fritz's book, Creating, to continue learning what this author has to offer. The Law of Attraction info is more accessible to me - but I don't mind doing the pick and shovel work to dig out the gems in this author's work.Creating: A practical guide to the creative process and how to use it to create anything - a work of art, a relationship, a career or a better life."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"It's practical. It's basic. It works.This book showed up in the mid eighties... wish I had read it back then. Fritz presents user friendly techniques for creating your life, rather than solving your problems. He starts by referencing artists and I find that an excellent context because I associate art with creativity and imagination. Many self help books use a manager frame, which feels like a duty.Fritz doesn't offer much help around what to do when you get stuck in your creating process but there are other books for that. What does stand out, and gloriously so, are his simple tools for creating, particularly the whole idea of managing the structural tension between your vision and your current reality.I recommend the book to anyone who is tired of new age fluff and wants some practical help."},{"Title":"The Path of Least Resistance - Learning to Become the Creative Force in Your Own Life","review":"This book is the most fascinating explanation of the creative process I've ever come across.

When Ava purchased her home she was told that the house next door would never be occupied and for the past two years it hasn't, but it is now.L.A.P.D. detective Cole Dumont has returned home to Minuet to recuperate from a stab wound he received while on duty. He moved away years ago swearing never to return, but his brother convinced him that he needed to get away from the bustling city. And, with a doctor living next door, help is only a few steps away. When Cole finds out that the initials behind Ava's last name are Ph.D. and not M.D., he's at a loss as to what to do. To top things off, he is plagued by the memories from years ago that drove him to leave in the first place. Will Ava and Cole find the strength to help each other heal and find true love in the process?GOODBYE HEARTACHE is a wonderfully well-written romance. The characters, in the small town, all know each other as well as everyone's business, so rumors are rampant. Ava and Cole are equally torn between their past and present lives.

Ms. Johnson crafts the story of two struggling souls detective Cole Dumont and Professor Ava Millington who meet as neighbors in a small South Carolina town. They are each running from pasts marred by scandal. Ava has run to small town South Carolina hoping for a fresh start and indeed is enjoying her new life with a new professorial appointment and a quiet home next to a nearly abandoned house.Cole is running back \\"home\\" after years of trying to escape a shady past that result in the demise of his family at his own hands. After years on the run, Cole is ready to face some demons from the past in a last ditch effort to recover some semblance of peace in his life. He doesn't expect to be some quickly and deeply affected by the new neighbor he has been informed has moved in next door.Ava is none to happy to see Cole after becoming accustomed to having no neighbor, but she too is deeply and suddenly attracted to Cole.This novel follows each of them as they are forced to face past demons as they try to find away to move forward together. At nearly 400 pages, it is a long story that slows to a snail's pace at times. However, all in all it is a satisfying drama-filled romantic story about two souls looking for hope and love after years of dealing with overwhelmingly, traumatic pasts."},{"Title":"Famous Bombers of the Second World War, Vol. 2","review":"(A 4.5 star effort to me) As the owner of the 3 sister publications, this volume (the first in the series) attempts to cover a lot of ground within its slim dimensions - 18 different aircraft types to be exact, in approximate order of introduction to operational service.Of necessity the result is very much a brief developmental and operational history of each type, but the information is generally accurate and reliable (we're talking a 1957 publication here). You'll certainly find more comprehensive information about all of the aircraft covered in more recent publications, but William Green laid the groundwork in this pioneering effort. Each type is well illustrated (all B&W; but who cares), with reasonably comprehensive side profiles of major sub-types as well as a highly detailed 3-view artwork. Even 50+ years on, many of the photographs have not found their way into more recent publications.This was arguably the first (and very successful) attempt to cut through the wartime and post-war propaganda, nationalistic hype etc. to objectively lay bare the strengths and weaknesses of the respective designs.Covering 6 British, 4 US, 3 Japanese, and 5 German types, this volume aims high and rarely misses - the original benchmark publication.Not that easy to find, but if you're interested in the classic aircraft of WW2 do yourself a favour and chase this one up.

Since 1975 however, there has been sustantially more published about WW2 fighters than between 1945 and 1975, and though not all of those publications had new material compared to this one, quite a few did and quite a few of the new monographs about WW2 fighter planes were a lot more thorough, often discovering things in addition to this book or even sometimes contradicting it. Nevertheless it remains one of the best quick references for silhouetes and open airframe drawings, which have been used by Mr. Green over and over again in his later standard references such as the ten volume \\"Warplanes of the second World War\\" or the twelve volume \\"WW2 Aircraft Fact Files\\", both published by Macdonald and/or Jane's"},{"Title":"The Story of David: How We Created a Family Through Open Adoption","review":"Told from the perspective of an adoptive father, this is a very realistic view of one family's open adoption. This dad holds nothing back as he describes the ups and downs of building his family. While not all open adoptions involve such an *intense* relationships, his story provides one example of success *for them* (at least up until the time the book was written.) Each open adoption is different, as my husband and I have learned with each of our daughters' open situations. Even though the author's experience is different from our own (we don't have the intensity of contact with birthparents they have), we can still learn from it. The author's story also provides a voice for the unspoken emotions of many adoptive parents. While their openness has consumed their lives, it is refreshing to read about someone else who is willing to offer an adopted child full knowledge of his/her birth heritage. It is quick reading, a book that is difficult to put down once you start."},{"Title":"The Story of David: How We Created a Family Through Open Adoption","review":"This book is by adoptive parents who treat their new family in a humane way--without the secrets and lies of closed adoption. I wouldn't recommend it as the first book prospective adoptive parents read on the topic, because the extreme openness of the Howells' adoption might make them think they had to achieve such closeness right away, but I do recommend it be read. I cannot fathom the comments of the reviewer above.

This book changed my life after I read it. Like Nancy, I became pregnant in high school with the only reasonable alternative to be adoption. After speaking with a number of agencies, I decided that I wouldn't be able to place my child in the traditional, closed adoption. I loved the idea of open adoption because I could continue to see my son and keep in contact with him while continuing on with my own life. When he comes of age and understands what the situation is, I will be able to tell him why I made my decision and why I placed him. He won't question my love for him since I have played such an active role in his life. I understand that some people, birth parents as well as adoptive parents, may not agree or feel they could be a part of this type of relationship, but we think it works just fine for us."},{"Title":"The Story of David: How We Created a Family Through Open Adoption","review":"WE WERE GOING THROUGH AN OPEN ADOPTION THAT HAD IT'S MOMENTS.

IT WAS NICE TO SEE HOW IT IS POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE IN THE ADOPTION PROCESS TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILD INVOLVED. FOR THE REST OF THE CHILD'S LIFE THEY WILL NEVER QUESTION WHO THE ARE OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM. I ONLY HOPE THAT OUR STORY TURNS OUT AS WONDERFULLY AS THIS ONE DID."},{"Title":"The Story of David: How We Created a Family Through Open Adoption","review":"The goal of open adoption is to make sure the child knows his background and who he is. However, in &quot;The Story of David: How we created a family through open adoption&quot;, I fear the child will always be confused not about his background, but about his future and his place in two families fused through open adoption.Dion and Carey Howells start out basically experimenting with the concept of open adoption with no real guide to follow. They make up the rules as they go along; unfortunately, they are pulled into the painful emotions of a mom, Nancy, placing her child for adoption. This causes Dion and Carey untold amounts of anguish, to the point where they fight against the concept of what adoption is - a child given up by his biological mother at birth and placed with another family. So emotional are they over Nancy's decision, they run the risk of not having a child at all.Once David is placed with Dion and Carey, the relationship they started with Nancy and her family continues; confusing family boundry lines in a mishmash of grandmas, grandpas and even mothers.No one wants to make an adopted child stand out from his peers by placing emphasis on how he came into his present family, but through the process Dion and Carey followed, David will stand out among his peers as someone who has multiple family members created through open adoption and I fear as he gets older, he will have a hard time distinguishing who is who.Finally, because of the anguish Dion and Carey placed themselves in over Nancy's having to relinquish parental rights, they have decided against adopting any other children; denying David any siblings. Unfortunately, they will have to rely on Nancy providing David with any &quot;brothers&quot; or &quot;sisters&quot;.This book was written when David was approximately 4 years old. Since their open adoption was bascially an experiment, I would be curious to see how this experiment turns out. Too many factors are out of the hands of Dion and Carey - their! future relationship with Nancy, her husband, child and extended family; and how they will deal with David's feelings should any members of Nancy's family decide to move or end the open adoption relationship.Too many unknowns to risk with a child."},{"Title":"Individualism,: Old and new,","review":"You wouldn't think it, but this little baby packs a huge radical punch.

Though poor in material goods, the family rejoices with a richness of spirit, a wealth of love shared, devotion in their faith in God and in each other and the respect they share for each other.RIVER STORIES was a joy to read. Dramatic, yet humorous with strong characterization throughout, especially Dace, the father who taught his family survival with grace and love. As each character is introduced, one feels a kinship to them, almost as if one is sitting on the riverbank, looking in, taking part.I highly recommend this book for children and adults alike...to share together.

Not only will it be unhelpful as a tool to mastering the topics in the MCAT, it will be a hindrance because the topics are so poorly taught. The only good it does is that it provides an accurate outline of the scope of physics topics covered on the MCAT (and that information is free on the offical MCAT homepage). The explanations are very short, often incomplete, and sometimes outright incomprehensible. This is a book clearly not written by a person who understands the physics in a meaningful enough manner to teach it effectively.Because the MCAT is knowledge based, a person is better off simply knowing the material through and through. The outline of the topics within the scope of the MCAT and a good introductory physics textbook--written by people who have devoted their lives to the study and teaching of physics, will serve you much better."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT, Vol. 5: Physics","review":"I do not recommend this book. Not only it is poorly written, it will not give you the understanding you will need to do well on MCAT physics. This book is clearly not written by someone who REALLY understands physics.

The impoverished Jeffrey Wynne is returning a young lady from France to her uncle, Sir Mortimer. Their way lies across London Bridge, but they discover that a military guard has been set on the bridge. The houses that line both sides of the bridge from time out of mind are to be torn down to allow more room for vehicular traffic. The guard has been set to prevent those who had lived there, by that time the very poor, from creeping back into their homes. After some rather puzzling noodling around Jeffrey and Peg end up back at a house on London Bridge at the sign of the Magic Pen where a locked room mystery of a sort is waiting for them.Carr's writing is a fair copy of mediocre mid 18th century prose. He has done his homework because he tells the reader more about the minituae of 18th century life than the reader probably wants to know. The reader is also introduced to John Fielding, Magistrate of Bow Street (better known from Bruce Alexander's more recent mystery series) and Laurence Stern (libidinous parson and author of Tristam Shandy among other works).I ended up wanting to shake both the heroine and the hero. The heroine keeps running headlong into danger in the TSTL (Too Stupid to Live)fashion of heroines in older historicals and the hero isn't particularly nice. The fight scenes are so precisely described that the reader will have to stop and picture what they are doing, which slows the pace even more.You might want to avoid this book if you are not a fan of JDC or the mid 18th century."},{"Title":"The Demoniacs","review":"This book was bor-ring. It is supposed to be about some evil secret society, but after about fifty pages I gave up, as almost nothing had happened. This book was especially disappointing because I had just read his The Corpse in the Waxworks, written some thirty years before this one, and it was a brisk and inventive detective novel of the locked-room category for which Carr is justifiably famous."},{"Title":"Hearts Enchanted","review":"I have listed the book description below since it is not listed on amazon. I always hate it when you go to see if you might like to read the book and have no idea what it is about. You then have to read the reviews and hope someone has listed enough to get an idea.Book Description:The moment Lord Brian Fritzwarren saw the saucy, slender wench bathing in the river he could not staunch his desire. Her fresh, sun-warmed skin beckoned for his touch. Her flawless, seductive face invited him to rain fiery kisses along her delicate curves. That she was his enemy's daughter no longer mattered. The masterful lord resolved that somehow he would claim the irresistible beauty as his own. While she frolicked in the sparkling water, tawny-haired Maegan felt she was being watched..then she met the smoldering gleam in Brian's smoke-gray eyes. Her cheeks flushed with shame--but her blood pounded hotly in her veins as he boldly gazed upon her body. Shivering with fear and delight, Maegan fought what she instinctively knew: she could never let herself love her foe, but their paths would forever be entwined, their lives entangled, their Hearts Enchanted.Review:Maegan and Brain were forced to married by King Edward. Maegan to save her brothers and father, and Brain because he is the Kings Champion and Edward wants Wales and England to unite and quit fighting. By making them marry, King Edward hopes it will keep her family from rebelling against him. Neither wanted to married. They agreed to stay married for a year, however Brian held all the cards so she had to agreed that if she got pregnant he would keep the child as he needed a heir. However neither counted on falling in love. As in most of these books they had to overcome obstacles and keep people from killing them.Loved this book. It will probably end up on my favorites list anyway. Just wish her books were on Kindle. I click the link \\"I'd like to read this book on Kindle\\" for her books every now and then hoping they will eventually release them on kindle. I read 5 or 6 of her books when I was younger. I remember really enjoying them. So I have ordered her books and will start reading them.

He takes on up almost everybody from Dennett, to Chalmers, to the churchlands, BLock, Nagel, Tye, functionalsim, non-reductive materialism, theory of knowledge, you name it....all in 130 pages and revolving arround a single phenomenon-BLindsight. What emerges is one of the freshest approaches to the philosophy of mind that I have read in a while...probably since Owen Flanagans Consicousness Reconsidered. Now it is a very different matter if Holt succedds in all his objectives, I doubt he does, but it is true he is bound to, or at least should, spark ardent debate.Holt aims to discuss what the phenomenon of blindsight has to offer to philsophy of mind, and the theory of knowledge, concentrating mainly on consicousness. Thus, he starts with an introduction to blindisight and to other cases of dissociations between performance and consicousness. IN blindisghts, patients with damage to V1 and therefore corrtically blind, can still however detect stimuli in their blind fields, but in a special way. Without consicousness. That is, they deny seeing anything, but if prompted to guess wether the stimuli is there or not, or is an X or an O, can perform almost flawlessly. Holt defends the interpretation of the phenomenon that says that blindsight is vision without consciousness. This has straightforward implications: vision does not depend on consicousness (but does not mean consicousness is epiphenomenal-and he shows it), and, more importantly, means that consicousness is a real phenomenon, and a physical one at that. Why? well because what is missing is V1, AND V1 only, and that is strictly physical. And so Holt argues against eliminitavism and discusses the super-blindsight argument. He also shows how consicousness can be casual, or rather is casual, although is not specific on exactly where. He speculates on consicousness as an inhibitor of automatic actions, and has some support for this. It also makes sense. But all of this is just the start of HOlts attack on the entrenched positions of functionalism, dualism and non-reductive materialism.Holt argues against the zombie argument, claiming the obvious in that conceibability is not a good guide to logical possibility. His points there are good, but when he goes against colourblind mary, things get tricky. Holt mantains Mary already knows what red is like but only gains the red-recognitional ability. This is counterintuitive, but worse, unecessary. Holt forgets that maybe mary does gain knowledge, but that it is of a kind that could not have been gained before, and therefore the arguments assumptions are wrong. Or simply that mary gains indexical knowledge, or access too old physical knowledge in a different way. His position seems to fall to knowledge that/knowledge how distinction, and this line of arguemtn is not as strong as it could be.Holt also argues against Kripkes, and many a dualist arguments, for dualism. Here Holt shows how good a philosopher he really is. It simply does not work to use the analogy of water as h2o as illustrating anything about consicousness as a physical state. Our concepts are simply different, and changing them could make the latter identity necessary, or at least seemingly necessary, which is what Kripke argues for. Then comes Holts attack on non-reductive materialism. He shows how a token-type identity from consicous states to brain states is no problem for materialism, and further, how a token-token identity can be made to work. Simply by fine graining the types into tokesn will do, but Holt goes further. He also shows there are in fact purely phyisical, and commonly accepted physical, things that nevertheless have token-type relationships between their micro and macro-prperties.Holt also discusses Chalmers Hard problem, and shows that it is misconceived. As with Kripke, concpetual nuances could be to blame, as well as an insurmountably high bar of explanation set by CHalmers. Does it make sense to ask why consicousness arises out of its correlates anyway? He even attempts to close the Gap, but here he seems speculative (admittedly so) ans seems a little lost. He tries to use the concept of perspectives to do such a thing, and out goes another brave and interesting attempt. But I think HOlt does good simply by showing there is not necessarilt a hard gap, and that HE cannot close it is not to be taken against him. IM sure Chalmers would have a thing or two to say here, but I believe Holt does defend his views adequately. Finally, Holt discussess blindsights implications for the theory of knowledge by considering wether patients from beliefs about their unconsicous discriminations, and argues for an externalist, or maybe a dual internalist sometimes externalist view on perception. He also discusses direct or indirect views of perception and goes for a dual viw as well. Here I think his arguments for a direct form of perception could be countered.THis book should be read, and its originality serve as exapmle. The use of a clinical phenomenon to make so much philosophy is a brilliant move. Holt makes brilliant point after point, and one only hopes he writes a book on neglect, one on amnesia, one on whatever phenomenon he likes, as long as he makes it as valuable as this one. Essential reading for those interested on consicousness."},{"Title":"The case of the one-eyed witness (Pocket book editions)","review":"this was the first perry mason book i've ever read (i'm only 13), and i think it is one of the best books i have ever read. i haven't read any others, so i wouldn't know what to compare it with. this book had a lot os twists and surprises. i plan to read as many perry mason books possible."},{"Title":"The case of the one-eyed witness (Pocket book editions)","review":"I loved this book!

A great plot that had some twists that really surprised me, an unusually suspenseful (for Gardner) opening, and a dash -- just a soupcon! -- of romance between Perry and Della. Mm-hmm! I think it's time Perry Mason got remade into a good movie, keeping the 1940s or 50s setting, but with new actors. The Perry in the book was tall, granite-faced, and wore a three-piece suit -- but wasn't afraid to use a little muscle now and again. Plus he knew how to keep Della warm on a cold night!

Openings of Mason Mysteries are always strange, but this book's opening is rather unusual. When Mason has a pleasant time at a night club, he receives a phone call from an anonymous woman who urgently asks his help for a seemingly not-so-urgent matter. Mason ordinarily tosses away such an anonymous request, but he is moved by the woman's frantic, horrified tone.At last, Mason traces a highly likely woman, but she stubbornly denies that she called him. WHY? This riddle is the most interesting in this book. The answer doesn't fail my expectation.

Brittain, barrister and doctor of medicine. Harvard Medical School holds a class that covers everything pertaining to murder, from detection to an actual post-mortem. Its purpose is to educate police officers so they can do a better job in detecting criminals. Dr. Brittain is one of the teachers. Whenever an innocent man is convicted it leaves a guilty party free to menace society. [This 1950 book cannot be referencing the Marilyn Sheppard murder.]Chapter 1 begins in a long-gone environment: an urban downtown busy with people. A woman calls Perry Mason and inquires about a package. When she sees a man enter the drugstore she drops the phone and leaves the booth. Perry and Della are dining out. A cigarette girl tells them about what happened to her child. Perry notes this event, and later is given a package. Perry then visits the name given by that woman (Chapter 2). Perry and Della meet M. D. Carlin to give him the message; Carlin says he knows nothing. But Della and Perry don't believe him, and take action. The private detectives watching the Carlin house report a fire, so Perry shows up to investigate (Chapter 4). Later a telephone call tells Paul Drake and Perry that a body was found after the fire was extinguished. It matches M. D. Carlin, and Lt. Tragg is on the job. Perry surmises about the woman who telephoned him, and asks Paul to find this unknown person (Chapter 6).Paul Drake gets the names of customers at that nightclub. Perry visits the one living close to that drugstore, then asks Paul to have Arthman D. Fargo watched. Perry returns with Della to look at Fargo's house as prospective buyers. They find a dead body, and Lt. Tragg finds them (Chapter 10). Perry's fingerprints are found on Fargo's safe (from his earlier visit), and Lt. Tragg asks if Perry removed any paper from that safe (Chapter 11). Paul Drake gets the name of Arthman Fargo's girlfriend Celine Gilson and Perry goes to question her. [This tells about life in Los Angeles.] The conversation ends when Lt. Tragg shows up (Chapter 12). Perry learns that Mrs. Fargo is on a bus to Sacramento, and arranges to meet the bus in Stockton with operatives to question the passengers (Chapter 13). Myrtle Fargo denies making that telephone call, but Della notices something. The police take Myrtle away, and Paul Drake calls with bad news: witnesses who identify Myrtle and contradict her alibi (Chapter 14)! In Chapter 15 Perry sums up the case, and comments about eye-witness identification.Myrtle Fargo continues to deny calling Perry or sending the package, but asks him to represent her. Perry will raise the issue of reasonable doubt (Chapter 16). Perry learns that Celinda Gilson was married to the headwaiter at that restaurant (Chapter 17). Chapter 18 tells that the general public, who read the newspapers, was convinced that Myrtle Fargo was guilty as sin. Perry points out that showing pictures of the defendant to a witness was followed by the identification in a line-up. Perry's cross-examination of Mrs. Newton Maynard is the high point in this chapter. Then Perry's subpoenaed witness testifies about the repaired glasses. In Chapter 19 Perry reconsiders the events at that nightclub, and comes up with an idea to spoof a witness. Perry visits this witness, converses, then gets a big surprise (Chapter 20)! This witness tells about the racket that is behind the crimes. In Chapter 23 Perry asks Mrs. Maynard to test her eyesight by identifying a person in court; she does this, but reveals a fact that helps to clear Perry's client of the murder charge. Perry explains it all in the last chapter."},{"Title":"The case of the one-eyed witness (Pocket book editions)","review":"I don't know yet,I can't get its down,into to my Wi\\\\Fi Kindel ,I got to buy a new cordless Moden ,be for itts will down load its, Thank you"},{"Title":"The case of the one-eyed witness (Pocket book editions)","review":"This multiple murder case is extremely complicated, far more complicated than Mason realizes, leading to his making some errors that assist the police. It all begins with Mason receiving a phone call from a frightened woman while he and Della are having dinner at a restaurant. The call abruptly ends and Mason is swayed to take the case by the fear in her voice. He does not know who his client is even after he receives $570 as a retainer.As he interprets the fragmentary clues, Mason encounters two corpses and even more confusion. When he finally discovers what he believes is his client, she denies everything, even when she is charged with murdering her husband. There are many conspirators in the case, some of which are murderers and others that were simply bit players in other crimes.The story is copyrighted 1950 and somewhat explains a very dark aspect of the plot, the presence of deep racism against people of Japanese descent. One of the women in the conspiracy claims to have a small amount of Japanese blood and this \\"fact\\" is used to assist in carrying out a nasty blackmail based on racism. Other than that it is a good and convoluted tale, so if you can stomach the racism, you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Between the Testaments: From Malachi to Matthew","review":"Given that Judaism has its roots in the Torah, I errantly thought that when the Old Testament ended there was little left that significantly shaped the Jewish culture. Holzapfel would probably faint if he heard me utter the hint of that opinion. Obviously, I assumed incorrectly, and it wasn't until I informed myself via this book that I have understood better what went on in Jerusalem so many years ago that influences modern politics and culture both in the east and in the west. Holzapfel and Brown, both professors of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, explain in detail the fall of the kingdom of Judah-remember the Babylonian captivity-to the birth of Christ. Despite being so small, Jerusalem and Judea remained a breadbasket and a cultural influence to the Babylonians, the Persians, the Seleucid Greeks and the Romans. Since the prophets Lehi and Jeremiah prophesied the fall of Jerusalem around 600 BC until the establishment of a Jewish state in AD 1948, there is only a brief window of time that the Jews were able to rule themselves. The Maccabean revolution was a landmark event for Jewish history-from the political nature of the office of high priest to doctrinal changes in the Sadducees' rhetoric.But this book is not just about history. Have you ever wondered what the Dead Sea Scrolls were all about? How about the apocrypha, or the great Diaspora? Knowing what the sociopolitical conditions were in Jerusalem has helped me understand the New Testament much better-the spiritual interpretation becomes even richer. But his book is not a novel; so don't expect Kurt Vonnegut's metaphors or Toni Morrison's style. In fact, it is a bit dry-not unlike most history books.Richard Holzapfel was my History teacher at BYU. A dynamic lecturer with an abnormal analytical aptitude, Holzapfel merits his recognition for his achievements in the field of ancient scripture and early church history. I often recommend his class and his book to anyone marginally interested in early world history."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"Although I normally avoid this kind of book, I found this one to be very helpful...so much so, that I've ordered copies for two people who wanted to borrow my copy (because I didn't want mine to disappear).Although some reviewers of this book have complained that it \\"seemed like an ad for eharmony\\" I felt that the discussion of the research that went into the development of the 29 dimensions provided the evidence I needed and gave the balance of the book credibility.

His advice might be refreshing and pragmatic for many young people, for whom the social norm is that dating and sex are synonymous, and who consequently may be trapped into random relationships. Or, if you are a flighty romantic who plunges headlong into abuse, Warren's advice could save your life.Overall, however, I think it is best to make your own mistakes as nature intended. Human relationships should be based first and foremost on human contact, however flawed. Neil Warren's compatability insights might be an invaluable secondary tool for refining this process. However, I can not agree when Neil Warren argues boldly, in theory and practice, that compatiblity testing comes first, and that innermost feelings always can be added. Reading this book may be helpful so far as it goes, but do not take it so seriously as to join the Eharmony website.\\"Meeting\\" one's suitors electronically is inherently questionable. A certain vital spark is missing. To confine these contacts to those who undergo a compatibility test and pay a monthly fee is no less questionable. Some people are determined to be married a.s.a.p., or may feel they have no options except internet dating. For them, perhaps Neil Warren sells a leading product. However, by no means does \\"compatibility matching\\" bring us closer to \\"true love,\\" which is in essence a growth experience including the unknown and unexpected.Just as Einstein failed his math exams, many successful matches might score below the margins set for a mass-produced compatibility test. If you make your choices first, and then test for compatibility after, you might be more likely to find a relationship that seems meant for you, and to feel this as from an inner voice.Neil Warren's perspective, based largely on over-exposure to troubled relationships as a psychotherapist, is flawed. Warren denounces the traditional concept of \\"soul mates\\" as a dangerous myth. Within the context of many lives today, this is a point well taken. But Warren eagerly peddles the even more questionable myth of eHarmony \\"soul mates\\" flourishing harmoniously under his all-benevolent gaze as a white-haired, Colonel Sanders type character.The eHarmony website, as well as the title of this book, cynically capitalizes on the idea of \\"soul mates,\\" all the while preaching and presuming that such a spirit is always superficial. The greater your natural depth, the less apt might be such advice."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"This book can definitely improve how young women deal with men.

He and his associates have developed a questionnaire with over 500 questions to feret out who you are with respect to the 29 dimensions.

This book had not only helped me look for the important things in a relationship, but also to be aware early on when the red flags are there. I have recomended this book to several friends and have had great feedback. Oh and one more thing.. you know that saying about extra baggage over an ex... well this booked helped me see where my past relationships have failed. It wasn't just both our faults, we just didn't match, I have been able to worked through all that baggage with great sucess and with just a book !"},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone considering a relationship or for someone who is contemplating whether or not the relationship one is in is a good one. The 29 dimensions of compatibility offered in the book are make it or break it factors between two people who are considering marriage.

A MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"Once one move's beyond the introductory chapters, Warren's book is a terrific book to better understand the many aspects of compatibility! It is also an excellent springboard for discussion with a serious partner for prospects of a future, long-term and more intimate relationship! Hence, I highly recommend this book to both partners seeking to confirm or to affirm their prospects for a relationship beyond a friendship."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"I especially appreciated Dr. Warren's comments and reflections on character. It is so important. The book is genuine, reads well, and held my attention. He knows what he is talking about. It is thorough and clear."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"Dr Warren has great ideas however every chance the author gets, Eharmony is mentioned. Having been on that site before it made me cringe each time it's mentioned in the book, Im actually suprised that the author didn't say drink Coke, eat M&M's, and Dorritos, while listening to your Apple iPod. As soon as I felt I was connecting with something said the plug for Eharmony was right there to distract me. The website pulls enough revenue, can't you just write a book and not mention the website? My girlfriend tried to read the book and started laughing, when I asked what was so funny, she said the book should of had pop-ups with Eharmony discount coupons in it. We decided to read another book and have been happy for years as a couple."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"This book trained me how to find my soul mate, my one and only, my love, my everything.You too will find your soul mate and if you don't Amazon may refund your purchase price.

My boyfriend started reading it and immidiately brokeup with me! I'm not saying that it's a bad book. He started reading it as if it were supossed to define a \\"perfect relationship\\" and as we all know there is no such thing! I will admit that it was not entirely the books fault. We both needed some work, but because of this book it made him think that it was pointless. Thanks alot."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"First of all, I appreciate Dr. Warren's goal of courtship ending in marriage. This of course stands out from the vast majority of \`dating books' which often seem to present dating as an end in itself. There are no \`ten keys to hot romance' in this book. Rather, Warren's purpose is to address compatibility and marriage.In short, his realistic approach is refreshing. He doesn't buy into the pop-culture idea that each person is looking for the one person on the planet they were destined for from eternity past.Warren writes, \\"Surprisingly, many singles hold to the notion-either consciously or subconsciously-that there is one perfect, preordained partner for them. They were made for each other, the thinking goes, and they must simply locate this person or forever feel incomplete.... But, frankly, I think this idea is more fantasy than reality, more storybook whimsy than real-world wisdom.\\" And I believe he's right.Warren has an enormous bank of personal experience in both marriage and engagement counseling. He writes, \\"During my 35 years as a psychologist, I have counseled dozens of men and women who were convinced they'd married \\"the wrong person,\\" but who then went on to create top-notch relationships.\\"His emphasis appears to be how a person finds the ideal person. However, that's fairly different than what the book presents. What he's really promoting is a common sense approach to finding a \`compatible' person. With that said, I wish he had spent more time on how a person becomes more \`compatible' themself.With that said, Warren does touch on this topic. He writes, \\"I believe soul mates are made, not born. You start with the ingredients for a highly compatible, successful relationship, and then you work to develop closeness and intimacy. Does this mean you lower your standards when it comes to finding a partner? Absolutely not! It simply means you 'expand your field of vision.'\\"I found the Appendix to be particularly helpful.- Appendix A 'Three Secrets to a Great Relationship'- Appendix B 'Twenty Question for Evaluation'- Appendix C 'Items of Similarity or Difference in a Relationship'In short, there's very little hype or unrealistic pie-in-the-sky promises made in the book. Rather, he shares reasonable principles culminated in a reasonable approach with reasonable expectations."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"Amid the plethora of books on the market that advise singles on how to find and keep Mr. or Miss Right, here is one that is an absolutely must-read for anyone serious about finding the best person with whom to pursue a marriage relationship.Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons is by Dr. Neil Clark Warren, a clinical psychologist and the founder of eHarmony.com, a popular dating site that uses a scientific approach to matchmaking. The site matches subscribers based on 29 dimensions of compatibility, each of which is discussed in detail in the book. The dimensions were developed using the results of an empirical study surveying over 5,000 married couples.The first chapter of the book gives a background on the history and development of eHarmony.com. For the meat and potatoes of the book, move on to Chapter 2, where the discussion of the 29 dimensions begins. Dr. Warren divides the dimensions into four groups. Each of the dimensions is given a chapter in which it is thoroughly discussed.The Screening DimensionsThe Screening Dimensions are the 7 which are more or less the basic minimum of compatibility dimensions, those that can make or break a relationship in a hurry. These include such traits as good character, anger management, and family background.The Core Personal DimensionsThe Core Personal Dimensions are the second group of 16 dimensions. These are qualities that tend to be deeply ingrained in a person and are difficult to change. Examples are intellect, spirituality, appearance, sense of humor, ambition, and sexual passion.Skills That Can Be DevelopedThe next 3 dimensions are not necessarily permanent traits, but rather, they are skills that can be honed with time and effort. These dimensions are communication, conflict resolution, and sociability.Qualities That Can Be DevelopedThe fourth and final group consists of 3 dimensions that are, as the name suggests, qualities that can be developed. These are adaptability, kindness, and dominance vs. submissiveness.Though the book is no doubt a tool for marketing eHarmony, it contains sound advice, even for those with no interest in the eHarmony service. It is well worth reading because too often, singles in our society are given so little solid knowledge of how to find a mate. As an example of this, Dr. Warren relates the following story:\\"Oh, I'll just know inside,\\" one thirty-four year old man said when I asked him what standard he used in evaluating potential marriage partners. My dad always told me that I'd just know it deep down in my gut when the right woman comes along.\\"Isn't that ironic? That fellow's father probably spent more time teaching him how to tie his shoelaces than he spent teaching his son how to make the most important decision in his life.I can't speak highly enough of this book. It isn't a book about how to get a date, or even how to attract a marriage partner. Instead, it is a guidebook for knowing exactly what elements are essential in a life-long partner. In a sense, it is a checklist to use when evaluating each and every potential relationship partner. Yes, perhaps having a checklist sounds unromantic, but in light of the fact that 75 percent of all marriages either end in divorce or unhappiness, evaluating a romantic partner based on these 29 dimensions makes perfect sense."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"I do life coaching and public speaking for a living, including in the areas of relationship and sexuality. I have read a lot of books on both of these topics and was very pleasantly surprised that this was a solidly written book and not just a lot of hype.One of the things I most liked about this book was the emphasis on character. Dr. Warren was very direct about what constitutes good character, the likely outcome of dating people with characters disorders and the pivotal importance of being authentic and not dating people who lie.The author also stressed the importance of compatibility. A lot of people work too hard at relationship because fundamentally, they are not compatible. If they were, things would go a lot easier. There is a section in the book that breaks down compatibility into a number of different dimensions that I thought were an extremely useful lens for people to use when looking for a serious partner.I also liked the sections on sex and the healthy expression of sexuality. Dr. Warren points out that premature sexuality can often blind you to character faults and compatibility issues. While this is difficult to swallow for a lot of people, it sure seems to be true. He also talks about the importance of sex and sexual compatibility from a space of someone with a lot of experience counseling couples.The appendices in the book are just as valuable as the text. I particularly liked his sections on the \\"must haves\\" and \\"can't haves.\\" When many people are dating, they are not conscious of what their non-negotiables are and enter into relationship where there are a lot of good things, but one essential ingredient is missing. This is a very seductive dynamic, especially when the beginning of the relationship feels soooo good. However, it's like missing one essential vitamin; it will eventually catch up with you.Also, there is a great no nonsense section on sexual chemistry. Dr. Warren doesn't side step this important area and he makes it very clear that this is what separates potential friends from potential partners. According to him, there must be sexual chemistry and you either have it or you don't. Without sexual chemistry, people often end up having affairs or feeling guilty that they are not attracted to their partners.Overall, this book posits a conservative approach to dating. Many people won't be able to live up to all the advice, but the advice is sound and it makes good psychological sense. Some people will find the advice on sex overly conservative, but as adults we need to draw our own lines between the ideal and what is reasonable for ourselves. We don't necessarily have to embody the gold standard, but we can certainly aspire to it.Another interesting part of this book was the section that stepped through each part of the traditional marriage vows and talked about what each means. The take away point, was not that you just promise to stay together, it's that you promise to do the work to love, honor and respect each other. This section which contained a lot of commentary was a useful reminder of examining your deep intention before taking a walk down the aisle with someone. Sometimes people think when they are just staying together they are keeping their vows, but Dr. Warren points to something more than this as truly living your commitment. I thought this was a good point to make, although in practice I believe that sometimes divorce is the best course for some people. On the other hand, I like that he emphasized that marriage isn't something to be entered into lightly and either is a serious relationship.Dr. Warren talks a lot about eHarmony in his book and this can sometimes be annoying. I have never tried eHarmony or even looked at it in-depth online. However, whether that website is good or not, the book certainly is, so don't let any impressions you have of eHarmony get in the way of seriously evaluating this book.In short, the advice in this book is good to keep on your radar with the understanding that life isn't perfect and ideals are often difficult to live up to. Even if you disagree with Dr. Warren, his words are good food for thought and you will at least have a heightened awareness of the trade-offs inherent to less conservative dating approaches.This is not a book geared toward casual dating or casual sex. The audience is clearly people who are very serious about finding a lifelong partner. If you fall in that category, you can't go wrong. Another good book that complements this one is WILL OUR LOVE LAST by Sam Hamburg.I don't agree with everything this author says and I don't think he factors in enough compassion for the human condition and the challenges of modern life, especially around getting needs for intimacy and sexuality met. However, there is a lot of wisdom here and anyone can benefit from it.A problem of the modern world is that it's more complex to find a match than ever and it takes longer because people are more complicated and life is more demanding. While Dr. Warren gives excellent dating advice, he doesn't address how to meet your intimacy and sexual needs while you are involved in a lengthy search for a good partner. Let's face it; the kind of great partners that Dr. Warren is asking us to hold out for don't grow on trees. I wish he wrote section on friends, social support and other coping strategies for what to do in the meantime."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"Online dating probably isn't for everybody, but it certainly worked for me . . . after all, that is how I met Cynthia--my beautiful bride-to-be.That is why I also found myself drawn to the book, FALLING IN LOVE FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS by Dr. Neil Clark Warren . . . its subtitle, in particular, caught my attention: HOW TO FIND YOUR SOUL MATE.I wanted to see if Warren, founder of [...], could help me understand why Cynthia and I have clicked the way we have . . . furthermore, I wanted to see if Warren's conceptof a soul mate matched mine . . . methinks it does.As he notes:A soul mate is to his or her soul mate as a Mercedes Benz automobile door is to the Mercedes auto frame. They fit together perfectly; they match. You wouldn't want to put a Chrysler door on a Mercedes car; you wouldn't even want to put a Cadillac, Lexus or a BMW door on the Mercedes body. Although each one may be a marvelous door in its own right, it would not be the perfect match for the Mercedes automobile.Warren presents a very practical guide for finding true love, including:* The 29 dimensions of compatibility--the foolproof test to determineif two people will be happy together;* Your core personal dimensions--the 16 factors that can make orbreak your relationship; and* The \\"marriage killers\\"--the red flags you can spot during your fisttwo dates.There were many memorable passages; among them:How does the person you are considering as a potential marriage partner deal with anger? Does he have his temper under control? Anger mismanagement causes more divorces, I believe, than any other single factor. Many people simply cannot handle their anger,and they take it out on their spouses. Sadly, husbands often take out their anger on their wives, and wives often take out their anger on the children, thus perpetuating a downward spiral into the next generation. Anger, of course, is often the means a person uses toattempt to handle his or her pain. But it can destroy an otherwise good relationship if it is not expressed correctly.As I mentioned previously, I'm convinced that the selection of a marriage partner is the most important, far-reaching decision you will ever make. Let me tell you why. For the rest of your life, every day, you will wake up with this person; much of your day will revolve around this person in one way or another, whether you are at work or at home. You will come home to this person, eat dinner with this person, sit and talk with this person and, hopefully, you will go to bed with this person. When you wake up in the morning, this person will still be there! You will have a lot of thoughts about this person all day long, because this person and you will have numerous things in common, including your children, your money, your plans about your careers, and plans about your retirement. Think about that. One person...for the rest of your life! That's a lot of togetherness! Yet that's what marriage is supposed to be, and that's what marriage can be, if you select the correct partner. It is such an important decision that it should be made with great clarity and with as much wisdom, insight, and expertise as you can muster.That may not be the most profound definition of compatibility, but it is a good one. He gets me. She gets me. At a deep level, this person understands and cares about who I am and what is important to me."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"I'm a working psychotherapist and read this book in galleys. I think it makes a wonderful addition to the rather cluttered and confusing mix of books targeting single/divorced women with romantic advice, self-help and life-affirming programs. The core idea--one that professional therapists spend expensive hours trying to express to their patients--is that there is no \\"perfect person\\" to marry. Life is the movies; getting \\"swept off your feet\\" is best left to when you are swimming in the ocean. The rest of the book further explores the idea of \\"compatability,\\" which is also helpful, although it does neglect the entire construct of your ego development and independence, because a happy union generally rests on your ability to be happy by--and with--yourself. My major problem is that the book is an extended product placement for eHarmony.com, the author's company. But at least he's upfront about it--buyer beware. I also strongly recommend another book about marriage, for those women who want a family: \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life Aftr Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, easily the most funny, honest and detailed account of juggling marriage, kids, career and life I've ever read--and from the male point of view. Not a therapy book, per se--but laughter and honesty are certainly wonderful medicine."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"To me, I think this is a really good book that identifies the broad-based compatibility of powerful attraction between people and leads to have long-term love. It explain the rules in how we all should find true love, and describe ways people can change after marriage...and ways they can't and never will. It also explains the sixteen factors that can make or break your relationships and also mentions many secrets men need to know before starting a relationship. This book really helps you to avoid wasting years on the wrong person and the pain of a broken heart. This is an excellent book for those who want to find true love that you can relish for a lifetime. I recommend it!!!! Because you're learn something out of it!!!

However, when you're ready for something more, something real- this is YOUR book."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"Neil wrote a fine book with good advice. The most helpful section was the first screening dimension: Good Character. \\"Character matters!\\"My own and others' horrific experiences with eHarmony (passive aggressive and/or nonexistent customer service, fraudulent guarantees, questionable \\"matching\\" practices, low number of matches--zero globally for many weeks!, and charlatan billing practices), lead me to believe that Neil's company suffers from bad character.Let us follow Neil's advice: \\"Watch out for signs that reveal a diminished sense of conscience. People who willfully and regularly lie, exaggerate, or cheat have no regard for the rights of others. They will pay little attention to how their actions impact you, as long as they get what they want....A person with a character disorder has mastered the art of putting on a facade of social acceptability. He knows how to gain your confidnece and that of other people. The person with a character disorder is often a smooth talker, a charmer, a person who knows how to say just the right thing to get what he wants.\\"Neil, eHarmony can change for the better if you genuinely want it to and are willing to do the tough work to see change happen. But we realize that the prognosis for bad character is not good. Only three experiences seem to bring any real change--a stint in prison, serving in the military, or a deep spiritual transformation. We hope the people at eHarmony will be helped by at least one of these experiences.Folks, if you encounter eHarmony, run--don't walk--away from it as fast as you can. It will not get better with time."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"I read this book initially in conjunction with trying out e-harmony. With or without e-harmony or any other contact service, I think this book is a great starting point for \\"getting to know yourself,\\" which is huge in terms of being able to identify the right kind of person with whom to develop a relationship.I found the exercises in this book to be personally enlightening and very helpful.e-harmony as a service is just one of many ways to \\"get out there\\" and it's okay. I rate this book very highly however you get out in the world for dating and seeking to mate -- just to understand yourself better as a crucial starting point.Dr. Warren has a very definite Christian-oriented point of view, and I share some but not all of his beliefs. However, for me, his point of view did not interfere with his simple message of being clear on how you can figure out who you are and what you truly need in a mate."},{"Title":"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons: How to Find Your Soul Mate","review":"This book is a must for anyone in or contemplating a serious relationship. Dr. Warren has done the research and found what leads to lasting relationships. First, he talks about getting out of a relationship when someone lacks integrity.

You don't read this breed of book anymore, book stores just don't carry this style of epic horror like they used to, and I hope Grabowsky's stuff whips the genre back into shape.....if he can't do it, no one can.

It's nothing personal, it's just that it got old real quick for me. After reading this book, I am converted. All Hail Grabowsky! A book filled with a story so imaginative and profound, even I was astounded. Satisfying a reader's interest in alternative science fiction, classic horror, suspense and yes folks, even gore. The cherry on top, a captivating plot completely unique and interwoven definitively.The characters are so well detailed, you feel as if you not only know them, you can see them. You find yourself becoming emotionally invested in their struggle to persevere in this world, and hold strong their humanity. Even the antagonist is not without pity or beauty. The atmosphere is complex, murky, and entraps you. You become as bewildered along the journey as the characters are, learning only as you go.The pace is rapid, sucking you into this world of Grabowsky's, and you find yourself fearfully enjoying the ride. The style of writing is blunt, audacious and head on. While reading, you feel as if the author is whispering the tale to you. Seducing you from the first line, unable to find it in yourself to put it down and go to sleep for fear of what comes next, what horror lay ahead?Surely you're thinking, &quot;Now BloodyMary, this couldn't possibly be perfect&quot;. You're right; the author seriously needed an iespell, or another round of editing. Did it deter me in my reading? Absolutely not, this book rises above the average horror/science fiction novel.I give this book a 5 .

Grabowsky uses the alien abduction theme in a most inventive way, and his storytelling skills have advanced light years compared to his Randers novels which were great but less adult than this one. He builds an almost Tolkien-like mythology around the race of beings that live among humans, with Everborn and Watchmaids and Magdalene.

Whether you've seen the exhibition or not (I saw it and wrote about it at http://kate.stange.com/egypt/ps.htm), this is more than just a detailed catalogue of all the over 250 exhibition pieces. It is a full-colour, well-written wealth of Amarna information, including a wide variety of essays by all the most well-known Amarna scholars (Johnson, Redford, Lacovara, Mallinson, Reeves, Foster, Freed, Markowitz, Manuelian, Silverman, Kendall, D'Auria, Murnane), a glossary, list of excavations, miscellaneous reference information (such as cartouches of the royalty) and extensive bibliography (the bibliography alone is worth the purchase of this book). In the end, the over 400 colour plates (of sumptuous quality) probably show every Amarna piece I've ever heard of, and then some. They are the real treasure in this book.If you've never heard of &quot;Amarna&quot; or these pharaohs, this is a fantastic introduction to their unique piece of history and the stunning, unusual (for Ancient Egypt) art! You'll love it. Only it's a little too large to take to bed."},{"Title":"Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen","review":"An intriguing account of the life and rule of Akhenaten, one of the most controversial figures in Egyptian history. Akenaten, who is widely credited with being the world's first monotheist, rejected the well-established pantheon of gods and Egypt's capital to establish a new religious and government center at Aketaten, the &quot;Horizon of the Aten.&quot; The authors attribute this to the fact that the priesthood, especially that of Egypt's most powerful god Amun, had grown so as the threaten pharaonic power, and Akenaten's closing of the temples was designed to eclipse this threat.Much has been written about Akenaten's possible physical deformities, due to the appearance of surviving sculptures and paintings. The slack belly, prominent hips, almond-shaped eyes, long face, and large lips, not only of Akenaten but of other members of the royal family as well, have engendered discussions as to whether Akenaten actually appeared this way, or if he wished to depart from the traditional methods of depiction in Egyptian art. When Akenaten abolished the old system of worship, and set up the Aten, the disc of the sun, as the one true god, he also appointed himself as the sole intermediary between Aten and the people, thereby deifying himself in the process. (This deification of the person of the pharaoh was not without precendent. Akenaten's father, Amenhotep III, enjoyed such status in his lifetime.) The authors suggest that the unusual appearance of Akenaten was to give himself an instantly recognizable iconography appropriate to his divine status, much like the other gods' peculiar attributes, such as Osiris' mummiform body and green skin. This theory is supported by the fact that Akenaten's appearance in artworks changed throughout his reign, moving from relatively usual examples toward the most extreme depictions in the &quot;high Amarna&quot; style, before returning to a more traditional appearance before the end of his rule. The authors also note the continuing influence of the Amarna style for centuries after Akenaten's death, most notably in the tomb treasures of Tutankhamen."},{"Title":"Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen","review":"This is the finest exhibition catalogue for Egyptian art this reviewer has ever seen.

This book is a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone interested in ancient egyptian art."},{"Title":"Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen","review":"This priceless book is a compendium of Amarna and contains short essays on its history, a tutorial on its artistic conventions, and a 265 piece catalogue of its artistic achievements. I myself viewed the Pharaohs of the Sun public exhibition numerous times, and without fail was stunned each time I stepped between the colossal sandstone statues of Akhenaten and entered the gallery. This catalogue details the exhibition with text from renowned Amarna scholars, beautiful color photography, and an item by item review of each piece in the collection. This book is beautiful and dazzling, and a must for Amarnaphiles. To make your informational and photographical collection of Amarna art complete, I also highly recommend two other titles to compile a trilogy of this genre: Akhenaten and Nefertiti - Cyril Aldred / Images of Beauty: The Royal Women of Amarna - Dorothea Arnold."},{"Title":"Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen","review":"for those of you like me who may never have the opportunity to travel and see all the various places the many artifacts of egypt are kept worldwide, this brings it all together. the book is basically a nice bringing together of text with information about this time period in egypt as well as fabulous imagery of the artifacts so far discovered. many of these are overseas and i know personally i may never get there to view them in person. a great find, particularly those who want specific info or pictures of tutankhamun, nefertiti, akhenaten, and others all involved in the 18th dynast of egyptian rule"},{"Title":"Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen","review":"Like the book about Nefertiti by Joyce Tyldesley, this is a must for any modern believer in the Amarnian people - Akhenaten, Nefertiti, etc....and the Aten religion. If you have or haven't seen the related exhibition, then this book is still wonderfully illustrated and interestingly detailed and can be read again and again ! A MUST !!!!"},{"Title":"Grammar Report: Basic Writing Tools for Aspiring Authors and Poets","review":"Author and literary consultant Mark Shaw writes for writers. \\"Grammar Report\\" provides basic writing tools for aspiring authors and poets. The book is a collaborative effort which includes contributions from editors J. Heidi Newman and Christina Williams.I enjoyed the: Catchy Chapter Titles: Grammar Grabbers, Punctuation Points and their contents. The \\"Writing Samples\\" section offers practical built in suggestions, tips, and guidelines after each reading.Shaw writes with authority as he presents acceptable guidelines, and English usage rules while encouraging the reader to be their own person and to develop themselves and their writing style. His content is especially beneficial to everyday writers. I liked his suggestions for word usage and tools that communicate and ideas for enhancing visualization. An additional helpful feature is found in the \\"Learning from Others\\" selections found in the Appendix.I have read other books by Mark Shaw and found them helpful so I was pleased to find this book at our local library. Since \\"Grammar Report\\" was published in 2004 the nature of the publishing industry is in a constant state of flux. Shaw's approach at the time of this writing was addressing tools applicable to traditional publishingWith this in mind and with the technical advances made in computer software and the provision of grammar and spell check programs, beginning writers can rely on these newer helps. However, I suggest that serious beginners invest in a used copy of Shaw's book on Amazon or check local library availability.\\"Grammar Report\\" offers basic writing tools for aspiring writers as the sub title of the book suggests. The book is still an important help for beginning writers."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"A very cute book of rhyming poems about naughty children. I wish it had Edward Gorey's illustrations were included."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"I just gave this to a friends' one year old for her birthday. In the inscription I wrote that she ought to read and learn, as whatever she does in life will come back to haunt her. My friend thought the book hysterical.

I wouldn't recommend it as it seems to be intended for an audience who appreciates dark humor when in fact the stories are very dull and not the least bit entertaining."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"I loved the language and use of words. I loved the ironic didatic tone and the morals and its mock seriousness."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"Enjoyed reading this to my daughter and grand child. Although the stories are old they are still useful and enjoyable for kids today. Fun and funny outcomes in many of the stories."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"Hillaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales For Children, originally published in 1907, is a collection of tongue in cheek poems that would likely send today's political correctness enforcers into full out frenzy. As one example, the first poem is about a young boy visiting the zoo with his nanny. The kid disobeys his nanny and, as a direct consequence of his disobedience, gets eaten by one of the zoo's lions.The book is a classic.The only problem with this free download is that it only includes the text; it leaves out the original Blackwood illustrations and the later Edward Gorey illustrations, both of which which definitely added an extra something special to Belloc's great writing. Belloc's poems are great but the original Blackwood and the later Edward Gorey illustrations complement the poetry very well.If you're not familiar with this classic book, download this free Kindle version to check it out. If you (and the kids in your life) like Belloc's verse, then buy a print or e-book version with the original Blackwood or Edward Gorey illustrations."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"There's a sense of time gone by, a lot of these deaths were real for kids and the author's intentions are interesting to ponder. He was/is a great artist."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"The tales themselves are either going to entertain or prompt eye rolling (seriously, \\"Matilda, Who told Lies, and was Burned to Death\\" could have really just gotten away with the title), and the artwork does a good job of giving an impression of the times that the stories were probably written.The book didn't take me longer than 20 minutes to read through; glad that I had borrowed it from the library."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"Edward Gorey's first major posthumous publication is like a newly forged work, with freshness and originality. Published several times since 1907, Harcourt's reprint of \\"Cautionary Tales for Children\\" contains sixty-one new illustrations enfolding the 95-year old verse, and the result is very satisfying.Gorey created these illustrations several years ago, but for some reason, chose not publish them while he was alive. Gorey's Victorian style is a delightful fit for Belloc's verse. In fact, those already familiar with Belloc's Cautionary Tales or Cautionary Verses series may very well conclude that they were strong influences for Gorey's \\"The Beastly Baby\\", \\"The Gashlycrumb Tines\\", \\"The Epipleptic Bicycle\\" and others. Certainly, many of the verses in Cautionary Tales feel like they could have been written by Gorey: \\"Jim, Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion\\", \\"Henry King, Who chewed on bits of String, and was early cut off in Dreadful Agonies\\", \\"Matilda, Who told Lies, and was Burned to Death\\", and so on. Unlike the original cartoonish illustrations by Blackwood, Gorey's illustrations simply set the stage - the big moment is then played out in the imagination. It is Edward Gorey's delightful magic, at work.Glen Emil..."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"Edward Gorey brings an obscure children's text into the light of modern times with all new illustrations. Sure to teach your child valuable lessons in a most unconventional manner, CTFC contains short stories, in poetry form, of children being eaten by lions, dying of stomach illness, and burning to death (to name a few) because they didn't follow the sound instructions of their parents. In the same vein as The Gashlycrumb Tinies, this one is fun for children and the adult with an unusual sense of humor."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"JIM, who ran away from his nurse and was eaten by a lion.It's small wonder that Edward Gorey chose to illustrate Belloc's verses, written nearly a century ago - in fact, they were such a clear and strong influence on his work, it's hard to believe he didn't write them himself. 'Cautionary Tales' is a literary work that was years ahead of its time, parodying the overtly-strict educational children's verses of the time with tales of children whose punishment is wholly disproportioned to their crime. Gorey's illustrations, published only after his death in 2000, complete the ghoulish verses with his trademark nave and refined black and white crosshatching. Already in his seventies, Gorey has lost none of his charm and style and these illustrations are as nasty and sarcastic as anything he's done, perfectly complimenting the ironic text.'Cautionary Tales' is the first work of Gorey's published after his death, and it's a perfect conclusion to his illustrious career, and one of his finest works. It's an essential to any fan of this great artist."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"This is a brilliant book, of course, which has been utterly destroyed by the Kindle edition. All the lines of verse have been lost and instead the text is wrapped to solid justification, which makes it terrible to read. Formatting is nonexistent; instead of italics, it uses _underscores around phrases_, which is annoying. I strongly recommend avoiding this issue."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"One can imagine Edward Gorey mulling over these \\"Cautionary Tales\\",subsequently creating succinct Goreyesque illustrations for them. Then years later after presenting his family to us in \\"The Willowdale Handcar\\" he undoubtedbly mulled over ideas about families & children and came up with my personal favorite Gorey: The Gashleycrumb Tinies. If you like Gorey & you like the Tinies, you'll enjoy \\"Cautionary Tales\\".4 stars only because I happen to like the devilishly wonderful \\"Tinies\\" better."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"I was expecting a nice simple edition that included Edward Goreys illustrations as the review of the book stated. Why they would include a review for the hardcover edition with this soft cover version is beyond me, as they are COMPETELY different in quality. this edition looks like someone printed it out (poorly) from an 80s style printer and slapped a cheap plastic cover from walmart on it. it looks NOTHING like the \\"look inside\\" example at the top of the page. the justification in the print is screwed up, where once there were pictures is now a label \\"(illustration)\\" showing where the picture used to be, and the print itself is incredibly light. it really looks like someone just printed out a poorly edited kindle version. I cant believe they are selling this for 10 bucks when you can get the hardcover for $10.88 right now. it is such poor quality i am actually stunned its being offered on amazon; i think someone is printing this out of their garage. i will try to post pictures of this 10 dollar piece of junk soon. i have never had to return anything to amazon but i guess there is a first time for everything...."},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"Most of the reviews here are for the Edward Gorey version of Cautionary Tales. That's a really fun book, but readers should know that Belloc's little poems are a delight even without the pictures.Kids absolutely love them and are shocked by their wit. These poems give kids credit for being sharp enough get the joke---and not need absolutely everything sugar coated. When my daughter was six she was told to come to school with a poem to recite. Most of the kids had nursery rhymes or well known American poems. My daughter brought Belloc's The Lion and The Tiger. The teacher, who knew nothing was the poems, got a huge kick out of them, expecially The Tiger with its dry recommendation that \\"mother's of large families who heed to common sense, will find a tiger well repays the trouble, and expense.\\""},{"Title":"Cautionary Tales for Children","review":"This was one of the loved books of my childhood in the original edition, of course.I hadn't seen it for a very long time and was anxious to haev a copy for my younger grandchildren.
