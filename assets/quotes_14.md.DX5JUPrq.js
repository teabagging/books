However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"which is a waste of paper. What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it. Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason. I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one. In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'. The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair)."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

It's quick, it's short, it's exciting, it's thrilling, it's very well written and it's a good summer read - I promise."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is set in London, England. This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

His intellectual prowess not only perceives him as a mystical thriller but between the lines you can see the seductive yet fanatical characters he enlists. Before Stephen King his writing is considered fascinating and is still to this day one of the premier writers of history. Though his stories are not too long they embark on psychological journeys you won't want to miss.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated. And if you ever need a quick comeback, quoting Dorian Gray will throw off most anyone. And if it doesn't, perhaps you will have a new friend!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is going to have to be one of the best books I read this whole year. I so would love to have this book be a movie. It takes such interesting turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the whole era has always been pleasing to me. What a fun read!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now. Very well written and a wonderful Gothic classic. This freebie is worth downloading. The devil seems to be none other than his so-called friend who points out some truths to the shallow Dorian. That begins his unravelling. I won't be commissioning any portraits of myself - ever! (Reviewed from my Kindle 2)."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The tricky plot, the accurate psychological analysis, the theme of the double, of pleasure and sin make this novel still an up-to-date one and I was really fascinated by the scheming protagonist who, in a way or in another, can be told to represent the human being in all his aspects. Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \\"successful\\".

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Four stars because it's a bit slow at times.

Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

I've heard the name of topic brought up enough in life to recognize the title but was blessed with no spoilers being laid out and I was surprised at how engrossed I was with this read. I usually am weary about picking up classics because i don't like to get lost in the language but Mr. Wilde is clear and concise in his descriptions and His characters were very personable and interesting.I say READ IT! READ IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I used the built in dictionary regularly with this story which is rich with precise descriptive language of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.)

It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book.

Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments.

I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde. This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face. A Picture of Dorian Gray is now one of my most favorite books of all time. If only Wilde had written more than one novel!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was shunned by the public after publishing The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul.

Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read. I was half-way expecting long, incomprehensible philosophical discussions, impossible to decipher passages...my stereotype of 19th century literature. But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book. It is engrossing, absorbing, entertaining, and not the least bit boring. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel provides a fascinating story on a young man's desire to keep his appearance while having his age expressed and progressed in a portrait of himself. The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life. I have read this book as an assignment for preparation toward the AP [Advance Placement] test in English Literature and enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who, not only would like to prepare for an AP test in English, but to those who appreciate philosophy."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde). The depth of the ideas discussed is often overlooked by the simple way in which they are presented.Dorian's example forces us to examine our own lives and face the unmistakable truth: the choices we make everyday determine the state of our souls."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's novel takes us through the dangers and temptations of hedonism. It is a fantastic psychological adventure."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely.

Really makes you think."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the mid 70s I watched a two part mini series based on this book.

The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable. Addtionally, I am so enamored by this book because of the timelessness of the theme of societal pretense. This is a classic that one should truly make time to read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions.

This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination.

At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one.

At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century.

The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me.

Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie based on the other reviews, and found it to be a good read.

Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Art for art's sake? Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly.

It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England. The only rough spot is chapter 11, which can easily be skimmed over. My best guess is that it all would have been fascinating to Wildes contemporaries, but is somewhat meaningless in this age."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would happily listen to Edward Petherbridge read a telephone book but he truly does make this a very enjoyable book to listen to.

It's suspenseful, the ending is a sudden twist, and there's suprises all over the place. This book is free, so there's no reason for you to not get it. NOW."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This cover art features a portrait of an unknown, bearing no resemblance to the blonde Dorian in Wilde's novel.My parents kept a page of chapel sayings from Bob Jones Sr. on our refrigerator for many years. Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction.

When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed.

This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy. Jealousy of the eternal youth and beauty of the masterpiece; youth and beauty which will one day vanish from Dorian Gray's perfect face.It is at this moment that Dorian makes a wish to stay beautiful forever, while the painting ages in his stead. However, his youth corrupts him, a corruption which can be seen on the face of his painting. Beauty, which was once Dorian's greatest attribute, may become Dorian's greatest flaw.Oscar Wilde wonderfully paints the story of The Picture of Dorian Gray. His simple language and sentence structures makes the story easy to read and follow, yet adds a certain level of depth to the plot. The character of Dorian Gray instantly captures the attention of the reader, and Dorian's development throughout the story provides a deeper significance to the novel.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a timeless classic, relating the tale of a young man whose wish to be forever young becomes the greatest mistake he has made in his eternal life."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is simply amazing.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Very wordy.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing. The whole story could have been condensed to a 30 page novella and would have been enjoyable.And, as a side note to the posthumous Mr. Wilde, forty is not old and hideous."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have recently begun reading all those books I \\"should\\" have read a long time ago. I started with Dorian Gray because I knew the basic premise and liked the concept. I was sooo disappointed.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.

Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think. The prose is admirable, the characters are compelling, and the whole book is full of obvious and implied vice. This book, after having been taken to heart, is probably capable of reforming any provincial folk into cosmopolitan epicures."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing.

Read it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For the past several years, I continually heard the name \\"Dorian Gray\\". As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever.

Nonetheless, worth it for a free kindle book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time. It was the way I think a book should be written. The plot was both intriguing and unsettling. The ending to this beautifully told story would be - in itself - reason enough to read it.Although, the plot is not even the best reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" Lord Henry Wotton, one of the main characters, hold beliefs so incredible that they actually prove to be quite credible. They are very interesting to read, and you may find yourself agreeing with the majority of what he says, as I did.Make sure not to skip over the preface. It is also quite interesting. The whole book in very fascinating and enjoyable. But, be warned, chapter eleven is quite difficult, so make sure you are able to concentrate on it when you read it (although, it does not exactly play a large role in the plot of the book)."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\\""},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the version I read while first discovering the many talents of Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment. He becomes a person driven by pleasure and he decides to experience everything he can, whether it's good or evil. Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing. Never read any Oscar Wilde before, and didn't think I would love it. Truely witty dialogue and great morality tales are both fun and though provoking. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read.

While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world.

I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is real entertainment.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy. The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel. Pleasantly of course."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the free Kindle edition.I had, of course, heard of the Picture of Dorian Gray, but with the joy of a Kindle I'm now able to read it for free.Wow.The story is amazing. The character of Dorian Gray shines (sucks the light out of the room?) during the story. The imagery of the picture is wonderful to reflect the corruption of Dorian's soul. Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try. The ending while abrupt, was perfect for the character, as it seems that Dorian was protected by something, to make sure that his end could only come about the way that it did.Definite recommend."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was tempted to take off a star for the way the second half of the book tales off and becomes so concerned with Dorian Gray's decadence. However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas.

Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before).

At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School.

You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism.

Wilde did an outstanding job in conveying his thoughts and opinions through Lord Henry. Dorian Gray was a very intriguing character who made me really think about myself and my actions. The only downfall of this book, in my opinion, is that there was no substantial background given on Lord Henry. I kept waiting to find out about his history, but there was none. Oh well...just adds more to the mystery surrounding the entire story."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The definition of &quot;classic&quot; is something timeless and universal; this book is neither. It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine!

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas.

It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read.

I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"An absolute classic. This has always been my favorite. I highly recommend this book. It gets better everytime I read it!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is a classic. Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb.

He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember.

She was very pleased with the item and would recommend ordering from here again."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story of Dorian Gray is one that everyone knows, yet knowing what the premise, and most likely how the story ends doesn't detract from this amazing read. This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like. This is a book that should be in class rooms more often."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wanted to give this four stars, but I just couldn't. This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel sad that I couldn't give this book more than two stars.

The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility. However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into. The first half is a way for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading.

The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill. This is the book which reveals that Oscar Wilde was blackballed by the Oxford Union."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar WildeI have downloaded this ebook and have found it to be the most well thought out in terms of navigation."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's classic gothic tale of a man who is granted his wish to remain forever young is still a fine and compelling read. Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable? I remain in good humor and fine favor. Yet I am changed. My approbation of this miracle is boundless. This work intoxicates and leaves one wanting more. In my esteem nothing is more beautiful or useless than this masterpiece"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It will be a while before I forget this book. Dorian teaches me a very important lesson:You can never escape the consequences of evil and regardless of how fortunate you are in some areas of your life, there are always lurking in our souls those moments of shame and regret.I know that the book has many messages about narcissism, beauty, art, conscience, friendship, social classes and other topics, but Dorian's inability to shake his evil actions is what I will remember the most."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables. Aside from the tangents on his experiences abroad and the scents of different flowers and such, it was a good read. Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering.

After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months.

It is also the first book that I have read using my new Kindle. It was a good experience both with the Kindle and the book. I highly recommend it. I now understand why Oscar Wilde is considered a great writer. Kelly Robinson"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious.

He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray has to be one of Ocsar Wilde's best books. This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth.

An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it.

I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader.

Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book.

Any person who performs objective medical research can confirm that there have been many legitimate medical studies that have shown that caloric restriction is the only proven way to extend life in mammals. The evidence supporting this is compelling. The challenge is how to implement this concept in everyday life, particularly if you enjoy eating food, as this reviewer does. It may be difficult for the average active adult to follow a severely restricted diet for a prolonged period of time. However, Dr. Walford's book contains some good recipes, which may be sufficient to put his research and concepts into dietary reality for many people. Dr. Walford's book is a well-written book and worth reading. It is not a fad diet, by any means. It is possible to use the information in this book as a motivator to eat fewer calories and, just as important, to eat more nutritionally dense food (e.g., whole grains, fresh vegetables, beans) as one grows older and as one's metabolism slows down. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject. You can learn a lot by reading it. It is unfortunate that Dr. Walford died of Lou Gehrig's disease.

Both of the latter are much more recently published. I enjoyed reading the Anti-Aging Plan, but was surprised that after only 80 pages or so it transitions into Part 2, which is completely recipes (albeit much needed recipes). In addition, I felt that the book could have used a bit more technical backing in describing its summaries of research information. I understand that Dr. Walford wrote other books that contain this information, but I don't see why some of it couldn't have been included here. As for the remainder of the text, I believe Dr. Walford's enthusiasm and support of CR were both motivating and forward-thinking; unfortunately, however, many important elements of a CR diet are not discussed or are outdated, presumably due to the age of this book. For example, in the sections on Vitamins and Supplements, certain recommendations are made (C + E are good examples) that are more or less debunked by recent research presented in 'The Longevity Diet'. In addition, the later books focus on important topics such as Glucose, Insulin and IGF-1 and these are conspicuously absent from 'The Anti-Aging Plan'. In summary, I feel that this book represented an important step in moving CR to the public consciousness, but if you are new to the game, I recommend starting with 'The Longevity Diet' first."},{"Title":"The Anti-Aging Plan: The Nutrient-Rich, Low-Calorie Way of Eating for a Longer Life--The Only Diet Scientifically Proven to Extend Your Healthy Years","review":"Severe restriction of caloric intake is associated with increased longevity, for those whose restricted diets are nutritious. This has been in the news any number of times, so it's not really news any more. If it won't qualify as a 200 word news article, making a whole book out of this topic produces boring results.That said, the author describes some of the experiences inside the Biosphere, where the restricted diet reflected a need for the crew to produce all their own food with limited farm equipment. Not only were their diets restricted, they also had a restricted pantry of ingredients to choose from.So the menus in the back of this book reflect some ingenuity in making healthy and interesting menus. The dishes described here contain lots of vegetables, and the sauces are mostly made without a lot of oils. The selections still seem to be delicious, based on extensive uses of lemon and herbs.

However, I found that evidence presented in this book was poorly substantiated . A large amount of the evidence was based on non-human animal testing on species with short lifespans and fast metabolisms. While such tests are often effective, there are plenty of examples in which results of animal tests do not carry over to humans. I would want significantly more evidence prior to embarking on such a radical, unconventional lifestyle change as calorie restriction. What's more, calorie restriction carries heavy risk of malnourishment or severe caloric deficiency if not executed with the utmost care. While these risks are covered, I would have liked to have seen the authors do a better job of emphasizing them.Dr Walford's claims remain highly controversial years after his death. While small primate studies have suggested that calorie restriction may have life-extending effects in hominids, there are a number of variables that need further study. One example is the fact that individuals following a dietary regimen of calorie restriction consume a much higher amount of fruits and vegetables compared to the general population. Such foods generally have strong disease-inhibiting effects and whole food diets have been proven time and time again to increase the likelihood of humans living longer, healthier lives. Secondly, individuals following Dr. Walfords plan tend to be both educated(they are after all reading scientific dietary books) and health conscious(why follow calorie restriction if not for your health?). Educated individuals earn higher incomes and statistically have better access to health care. Health conscious individuals are also more likely to address health systems and utilize that health care. Obviously, these factors contribute to overall life expectancy. It is thus difficult to determine how much actual caloric restriction plays into the extension of lifespan when compared to a healthy lifestyle.I think Dr. Walford's theories hold merit, but human study is undoubtedly necessary to recommend drastic lifestyle change, especially in light of the associated risks. Such study is difficult considering the longer lifespan of humans and the relative newness in popularity of the late doctor's theories."},{"Title":"T.A.

A few years later, the blinded Merlin leaves the woman who claims to be his mother, to find out where he came from.

But the evil Rhita Gawr is threatening to destroy the life of the island -- and may destroy Merlin as well.\\"The Seven Songs of Merlin\\" opens where the first book left off. Merlin is determined to bring his mother, Elen, to Fincayra. But his magic attracts the attention of Rhita Gawr, who wants both mother and son dead. Soon Elen lies fatally ill, and Merlin has only one month to find a magical potion that will save her life. To do it, he will have to master the Seven Songs, and travel into the Otherworld...As \\"The Fires of Merlin\\" begins, Merlin is relaxing with his mother and his sister Rhia, and honing his skills as a wizard. But he soon learns that things are about to get nasty -- he's being followed by creatures that suck away magic. Worse, he learns of a prophecy that he will fight the legendary dragon Valdearg, whom his grandfather defeated long ago. The problem is... neither he nor Valdearg will survive the battle.\\"The Mirror of Merlin\\" dips into T.H. White territory. Merlin and his beloved Hallia head into the Haunted Marsh to find a missing sword. They find a young boy, Ector, lost in the marshes. But then Merlin is infected with the bloodnoose -- which will split his head in half if he can't find a way to stop it. Desperately, he accompanies Ector to find the boy's master -- and learns that the master is none other than the elderly Merlin himself.\\"The Winds of Merlin\\" brings the series to a shattering climax. The spirit lord Dagda warns Merlin of the possible destruction of Fincayra. To protect Fincayra and defeat Rhita Gawr, Merlin must join together all of the peoples of that land -- but he must battle the dark figures from his past, who now have returned to see him dead.Few fantasy series are as beautifully made as the \\"Lost Years\\" series. T.A. Barron takes his love of nature and a handful of Celtic legends, and blends them into an action-packed, magical fantasy. Not to mention a wicked coming-of-age story. Barron's writing is detailed and full of lush description, ranging from the barren wastelands to beautiful forests to the ghostly Otherworld.And his characters are even better drawn -- Merlin is full of doubt and confusion at first, but he slowly gains strength and power. By the end of the series, it's not hard to imagine him as the wise old wizard. Supporting characters like Rhia and Elen are also well done, while the villains are given motives and reasons for acting as they do (revenge, saving their family).T.A.

They just summarize the text in arid words, and then skip to the next philosopher in the chronicle order. Writers of those textbook seem to think that we should rever the philopophers, do not understand them. Reading through them only gives us the superficial impression and worse, the knowledge we&iexcl;ve got is likely to be evaporated to the oblivion. We can&iexcl;t imagine that those philosophers lived their own life and breathed the air just like us. But the texts they left to us have what to say. And it&iexcl;s closely related to its own time. To understand those texts, we need to know their worlds, for the text says about the world it&iexcl;s written. Greek philosophy and literature also should be apprehended with such background knowledge. For example, there were no professional philosophers isolated from the rest of the society in Archaic Greek world, like professors of philosophy we could see in our Universities. Greek philosophers told about their worldly affairs. So Aristotle was mastered that much various fields from political sciences, ethics, aesthetics, cosmology to botany. In other word, we should know their life to figure out what they say at all. Greek philosophy was not isolated from the society unlike contemporary philosophy. This book should be definitely helpful to know their time. As the title of the book implies, this deals with how the Greek saw their world. Each chapter describes the way they see elements of their world from the religion, the state, the individual, to the art. With closing the last page of the book, I bet you could illustrate what was the life of the Greek in your mind."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life ;","review":"I read this book prior to beginning a course on Greek mythology, and I'm finding its insights into ancient Greek culture helpful as I follow my lessons."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life ;","review":"The quarrel of the philosophers with the myths is not that they are not true, but that they are not edifying. The opposition between science and religion was developed early in ancient Greece. Plato, the deepest thinker, was also the farthest from popular faith. The Greek religion involved a belief in a number of deities who were personifications of the powers of nature and were founders and sustainers of civil society. The harmony which was the essence of Greek civilization was a temporary compromise.In the Greek conception the citizen was an aristocrat. In the majority of the Greek states slaves were a greater part of the population. The states Crete and Sparta were practically military garrisons. The majority of the Greek states were in a constant state of flux. The Peloponnesian War represented a contest between democratic and oligarchic states. Plato based his REPUBLIC chiefly on Sparta. The constitution of Athens was political equality imposed on social inequality. The Greek states were not well-organized.The fusian of the idea of the beautiful and the good is the control point in the Greek theory of art. Primarily, Greek sculpture was an expression of the national religion. Music was the center of Greek education. Music is a union of melody and rhythm and poetry. Poetry was viewed as a storehouse of practical wisdom. To represent suffering as the punishment of sin is the constant bent of Aeschylus. To justify the law of God against the presumption of man is the central idea of Sophocles. In Greek tragedy the general point of view predominates. The Greeks sought to create and maintain essential harmony."},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"This is one of my personal favorites in the series {though I've gota admit I love them all} Even though its basically the same as that show it puts a twist on it.A loyal fan"},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"If you're home every single Tuesday night with your tv tuned to the WB network, then I think you'll enjoy this whole series of books.

Personally, it's been so long since 'The Harvest' aired that I found the book really useful in helping me remember what happened in the pilot episode. Also, it's a good source for quotes and analyzing 'special' moments in the story of Buffy. I'd recommend buying it to anyone who is really into Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Richie Tankersley Cusick does an adequate job of transcribing the events of \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" and \\"The Harvest\\" into book form, representing the characters truthfully, and making the action and suspense - well, suspenseful.Buffy Summers has just moved to Sunnydale, seeming to be just another beautiful, blonde teenager, but in fact harbouring a dark secret. She is the Vampire Slayer, the one girl in all the world imbued with the supernatural strength and skills in order to protect it from the spread of evil.And her arrival in Sunnydale seems timely. After meeting her new Watcher (trainer and researcher) Rupert Giles, and two new friends Willow Rosenburg and Xander Harris, Buffy becomes aware of an evil rising in the small town. Trapped in a buried church awaits the Master, a vampire ruler, whose night of escape is drawing closer. When the Harvest comes, he can draw enough power to open the portal between our world and hell: the hellmouth that Sunnydale unknowingly rests upon. And only Buffy can stop him.Along with introductions to Angel, Darla and Cordelia Chase, Cusick handles the material well, making this a short but sweet beginning to the realm of Buffy-based books.Wow, that was the quickest, easiest review I've ever done!"},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"The first novel based on the WB series introduces you to the characters. It's an exact copy of the pilot episode were Buffy comes to Sunnydale and meets Xander, Willow, Cordelia, Giles and Angel as they learn more about The Master and his harvest plans.

It lost 1 star due to the fact that it's an exact copy."},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I am a latecomer to the Buffy mythos. The show had already been on TV for a year when I finally rented the videotape. And it wasn't until the end of the second year that I started watching it regularly. As a result, there is a huge gap in my knowledge of Buffy lore, which can only be made up by studying the ancient tomes. &quot;The Harvest&quot; has eluded me for some time.One of the problems with being a middle-aged Buffy fan is that your friends look at you strangely when you mention it. Not only did I have no idea how Buffy got to Sunnydale, how she met the rest of the Scooby gang, etc., I had no one to ask about it. &quot;The Harvest&quot; is a fun, easily read book that covers the first episode perfectly. For me, it brought a lot of the puzzle pieces together. It lacks much of the pain and anguish of the Buffy of the later years and so is quite a bit of plain good fun. Buffy's quips at vampires seem quippier and Xander's antics still have their charm. Willow's honesty is winning, and Cordelia is, well, Cordelia is Cordelia. Giles doesn't get as much play as he should, but that may be a bit more characterization than it's fair to expect from an 146 page retelling of a TV episode.As a matter of fact, it's amazing just how fresh this book is, even after countless Buffy books and episodes. We get to follow Buffy as she makes new friends and discovers that she didn't quite manage to leave Slaying behind. Right of the bat (bad pun) she is embroiled in the battle with the master that spills over into many episodes. This is necessary reading for beginning Buffyites. Be prepared for entertainment, suspense and a whopping good finish."},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"\\"The Harvest\\" is a novelisation based on the first episodes of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.

On her first day she meets a few characters that will become essential in her fight against all that is evil: Xander, Willow, Giles, and even Cordelia. Sound familiar.... well it should. The Harvest is literally verbatim of the show. Is this bad? I don't think so. Being a life-long obsessed fan of the show it was fantastic revisiting the beginning.Buffy was hoping that a new school meant no vampires, but of course what would a Vampire Slayer be without the Vampires. On her first day of school a body is discovered in the girls' locker room, a body that has two particular puncture wounds on its neck.... Hmmm I wonder... Buffy quickly learns that her duties as the Vampire Slayer are not over. Then bring in Angel, the handsome mysterious 'friend' that warns Buffy about the Master's evil plans: The Harvest - his attempt to come back into the world after being stuck underground inside a mystical bubble-thingy.Again, after being a huge fan of this show for so very long (boy do I feel old) I am reveling in re-reading all the books. While the humor and one liners are timeless I grew up looking up to Buffy, somehow handling everything that is thrown her way and maintaining true friendships all the while being human (even struggling with being grounded like normal teens). In such a series, character development is built through every installment and through each fight the Scooby Gang fights. While Buffy is clearly the star of the series, each character shines in their own right - even Cordelia. This is one of those series that without literally every character (even the baddies) the books would not be as amazing as they are. If you are a fan of this show you won't be disappointed in the first installment of the book series. A must read for any die-hard fan!"},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Welcome to Buffy's world.

Same assignment. Something's wrong in Sunnydale, California . . . something more than the usual bad hair day. As long as there have been vampires, there has been the Slayer. One girl in all the world, to find them where they gather and to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their numbers. In this generation, she is Buffy Summers, 16 years old and a new student at Sunnydale High. Her experiences at her last school persuaded Buffy to try to resume the life of a normal teenager. But it is no coincidence that Buffy has come to this town at this time. The area is a center of mystical energy, and all the signs point to an imminent, crucial upheaval. Once in a century comes The Harvest: a night when the Master Vampire can draw enough power to break free and open the portal between his world and ours . . . unleashing havoc. With the help of new friends and a new Watcher, Buffy's back in business . . . .\\"REVIEWThe first in what would become an amazingly successful line of Buffy television tie-in novels, The Harvest is a novelization of the first two episodes: Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest. Cusick sticks very closely to Joss Whedon's script; the novelization matches almost scene-for-scene, word-for-word with the final televised episodes, the only differences being an occasional minor change to a line of dialogue.The downside is there's nothing here that wasn't on the screen, but the upside is that Whedon's humor shines through bright and clear. As The Harvest doesn't add anything to the episodes, this book is probably only for two classes of people: those who can't obtain the original episodes on VHS or DVD; and those who collect all things Buffy."},{"Title":"The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I recently decided to start reading all of the BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER titles, and this was a great start to the series.I really enjoyed being introduced to Buffy, Giles, Xander, and Willow, and I'm sure there will be much more to learn about these characters.

It's intelligently written and the story develops into two love stories between the same two women -- the first being lust based and the second of loving someone even when it isn't easy. The sexual tension develops realistically. What I really liked is that once the \\"straight woman\\" realizes she has woman-to-woman desires she acts decisively with her family, friends, and in her business. I really hate the \\"I have so many doubts -- is this right for me\\" plot in most novels of this ilk -- and this book doesn't go that route which was a refreshing change. I hope this author writes many more books."},{"Title":"Shaken","review":"KG MacGregor's Shaken takes the reader on an emotionally intense journey through the lives of two women. It is a riveting story that touches us to our very core.Anna and Lily are thrust together in the aftermath of a 7.2 earthquake in Southern California. They are both trapped in a collapsed mall where they struggle for their very survival. After they are rescued, they do not see each other for seven months, and then a chance encounter on the street brings them together again. From that point on they are almost inseparable, until tragedy and loss threatens their budding romance, forcing each to make difficult choices.MacGregor's writing is vivid throughout the book beginning with the first pages. As an earthquake survivor myself, I was glued to the account and felt like I was there in the collapsed mall digging out with Lily and Anna. It was powerful and real right down to the details of what everyone was doing right before the \\"Big One\\" hit.But the quake is really a metaphor for all the tremors in this story. As the characters are fleshed out, we learn about Lily's early life in the foster care system and how it has infused her with insecurities, even after she was adopted by a loving teacher of hers. She and Anna come from two very different family backgrounds and histories. Anna, recently divorced, is an executive in her family's car dealership, working for her father, and surrounded by a loving stepsister with whom she shares everything. Lily is a family law attorney used to working with domestic disputes, and her adoptive mother is her only family.MacGregor deftly portrays the hurdles these two women must face if their love is to survive. They struggle with their differences as the relationship evolves, but obstacles continue to be thrown in their path. First it is Anna's father and his aversion to his daughter's sexual preference, then a sudden death of a family member, Anna's obsession with her business, and finally, the breaking point, Lily's self-destructive behavior because of her insecurities. Through the three year span of their relationship we get to know Anna and Lily intimately. We experience their misunderstandings, and we feel the angst of a tentative love that turns passionate.In Shaken, MacGregor has created a romance with challenges and emotionally charged issues. The story is gut wrenching at times, but soul cleansing throughout. We are exposed to the inner depths of the love and turmoil these women share. Shaken carries us through Anna's and Lily's journey with compassion, honesty and even a little humor, and MacGregor does this with such expertise that we cannot forego this uplifting story of survival. I highly recommend Shaken."},{"Title":"Shaken","review":"Like the other reviewers have already said, Shaken is fantastic! Having read volumes of lesbian fiction, I found Shaken a refreshing change from some of the angst and mushiness that often permeates this genre. The story, without giving up the plot, includes it all - suspense, romance, great intimate moments, humor, and even some beautifully written emotional rollercoasters. What makes Shaken stand out in the crowded elevator of modern lesbian fiction is that KG MacGregor has written her characters as tangible, believable people who have tangible, believable problems and react to these in very human ways. Even situations in the book which are not everyday occurrences (don't want to give up plot points) are written such that one could actually imagine being there. KG also writes compelling secondary characters; in fact, the secondary characters are so well-developed, I found myself wishing KG would write a few \\"spin-off\\" tales for these characters. The only problem with Shaken is that once you have begun reading it, you will not want to put the book down! Shaken is, by far, the best of its kind I have read and I am eagerly awaiting the release of other books from this extraordinarily talented author!"},{"Title":"Shaken","review":"Fantastic page turning writing. A great story that spans several years. You really get to know the people. The story is a wonderful romance that develops into a relationship not only with themselves but also their families and friends. The characters are utterly endearing without being stereotypical. Wonderful humor as always from this author.There is a plot development halfway through the novel that caught me by surprise as it was not typical of a romance, so be prepared for a very intense read. I love when reading this author's novels that I never find myself saying \\"like that would really happen!\\". All the behaviors of the characters are believable - especially Andy - I love that kid!This is a six star book !"},{"Title":"Shaken","review":"If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this book, it is well worth it!

These are two very strong and passionate ladies! You will instantly fall in love with them and their humor is wickedly good! I can say that I like all the characters in this book. Shaken has a little bit of everything and it is a very enjoyable, easy read. I look forward to read more from Macgregor."},{"Title":"Shaken","review":"I read this book on the net sometime before it was published and found it far superior to much of the \\"Uber\\" stuff I found. Then I picked up the print copy and found that I knew a great deal more about Anna and Lily individually and as a couple than I did before. I've read more of MacGregor's work, both on the net and in print and think this is the best of all, though I have yet to read anything I thought was mediocre. This book is much more than soul-mates meet, have sex, fall in love and live happily ever after. Learning about the major problems these women have makes me believe they are human and not just uber-characters. Neither of them is as perfect as the templates they are based on.

Her characters seem alive, her settings are beautiful and her writing exhibits a real talent. In a nutshell, she's one of my top 5 favorite authors.In \`Shaken,' she introduces Anna Kaklis and Lily Stewart. Anna is a married woman and the heir to a successful BMW dealership. She finds herself trapped in a mall with attorney Lily Stewart after an earthquake. Although separated after their rescue, that first chance meeting creates an unbreakable bond between the women.

The book is one of the most expensive I own and well worth the price.Each time I look at the images that Andre Kertesz captured (as seen in this book) I simply have a difficult time understanding how so long ago, Mr. Kertesz had the instinct to see and capture the visions he saw. I'm not aware of any specific training people may have had in photography nearly 100 years ago, and I suspect there was no training, classes available, but Kertesz obviously was gifted and very talented, if not formerly educated in this field.The quality of the book is grand. The pages are thick and luxurious and the reproduction quality of Kertesz's images is wonderful. The editors are to be commended on this superb publication."},{"Title":"Andre Kertesz","review":"This is a superb collection and a true tribute to this incredible photographer."},{"Title":"The Oxford-Duden German Minidictionary","review":"This pocket German dictionary is the best I have come across. I really wish they would make a new edition (for the computer age) but it has served me well for the last 10 years! Since the 7th grade when I began German, & now entering Graduate School this dictionary is essential.Of all minidictionaries in German I know of, this one seems to contain the most words. I like that when you look up a word the entry lists all forms of the word. German verbs usually have related nouns and adjectives/adverbs, and the 1997 edition contained extensive lists whereas the newer editions get more and more concise. It helps users gain a closer understanding of the real meaning. It also contains many helpful idiomatic expressions, which have also been culled down in the newer editions. I wish they would go back to the 1997 editions, maybe edit it for accuracy, and add new words/expressions to suit the \\"computer age\\", instead of coming out with mroe and more concise editions. I bought the 2011 edition but its basically useless since I have this older better one.The new 2011 Oxford German Mini-dictionary ISBN:(978-0-19-969266-8), which is supposed to be the \\"newer version\\" of the 1997 Oxford Duden, but it doesnt hold a candle to its predecessor. The original editiors Prowe and Schneider of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd editions have been dropped, so has the \\"DUDEN\\" part of this translation (something I think is very important) and with them it seems to have many words and the layout. The 1997 edition was the very best while the 2011 attempts to be as concise as possible sacrificing much essential stuff. It seemed to contain the most words, I bought the 2011 but its useless compared to the 1997 which I still use everyday.

(And there's nothing wrong with that.) But the next time you don your imported Aran sweater, hunt up this interesting book to get a first-person account of the Great Blasket Island off the coast of Ireland. The narrator can be as sharp as the cold Atlantic winds, but even if you wouldn't want to take tea with him, you'll admire the detailed portrait he draws of this isolated place lost in time. Just remember, like the island itself, this is not a cozy book, but a bracing one."},{"Title":"The islandman,","review":"I read The Islandman after several visits to Ireland. This narrative or memoir gives readers a rare look at life off the coast of Kerry in the 19th Century. Relatively untouched by English influence, the lives of those living on the Great Blasket Island were different that most of the rest of Ireland.I was inspired by the book to travel to the Great Blasket Island in July 2007 and was inspired by the courage of those who made their living there throughout the 18th and 19th centuries"},{"Title":"The islandman,","review":"I just got back from Ireland and I read this while in the vicinity of the Blasket Islands. The book is a compelling first person account of life in the Blaskets back when the islands were populated with humans who kept alive by farming potatoes, digging peat, and harvesting fish and animals from the sea. Life was rough, homes were tiny and held the animals at night along with the people. The islanders' Catholic faith was sustained by priests who came from the mainland for last rites and by travelling to the mainland priests for wedding ceremonies. What a gift that an historian recorded the author's words when he and his memories were still alive, and that those words were then translated from Irish to English. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know what life was like in the Blasket Islands from the late 1880's through the 1920's. An excellent choice to take with you to Ireland."},{"Title":"The islandman,","review":"Some Irish readers term this a \\"poor mouth\\" book -- a woe-is-me, my-life-was-terribly-difficult tome that teachers recommended as \\"good for you.\\" I read it -- and really enjoyed it -- as a window into the kind of world inhabited by my Quinn ancestors before they left Ireland in 1832.

It was originally written in Irish Gaelic and is translated by Robin Flower. The English version is both poetic and obscure as Flower tried to translate the original language as closely as possible thus giving us an odd form of Hiberno-English which is redolent of The Playboy of the Western World (and of the way my own grand parents spoke).Of course one is reminded strongly of Peig while reading this, and the stories are as fascinating and poignant as Peig's are. I was particularly amused by the the recounting of the group of fishermen rowing out to catch up with a burning ship (they were hoping to benefit from the cargo they might salvage). However, they were surprised to find that, although the ship was very obviously on fire, it continued in a straight and determined path; other fishing boats joind in the trail following this peculiar ship. The author then reveals that it was their first time to encounter a steamship."},{"Title":"The islandman,","review":"To really understand this book you have to set the Wayback Machine to a time before antibiotics, grief counseling, no-fault divorce, and frozen dinners. The life and times described in this book are hard. That hardness placed enormous pressure on the character of the people in the book. What I mean is back in them days sometimes things were settled with fists and you died a couple of weeks later from an infection picked up from a scrape received in the fight.The story is about a man who lived on one of the small islands located in the far west of Ireland. He was born in a time of change and recorded the passing of a way of life that did not tolerate mistakes or fools.

Evidently this is a dated study on the role of Jews from Spain and Portugal in the discoveries made in America, and more specifically on the connection with Crist&oacute;bal Col&oacute;n (his authentic Spanish name).It is still an interesting read if you want to see the story from a different view than our modern eye: it was still being considered whether the natives of America were (or not) descendants of the 10 tribes of Israel!It seems to me a little chaotic in its composition, like a potential book of 500 pages had been summarized into a little more than a hundred. I mean: date, locations and names flow unrestrained thru the pages.Incongruencies also abound, maybe as a result of not clarifying the background of the story. For instance, when you would think that no more Jews would be found in possession of any reaches, and that the ones left (who survived) would be destitute, more of them appear in the scene as if nothing had happened to their brethren before. I read the book expecting to find more info on the Jewish origin of Col&oacute;n's family (as it has now been established), but nothing is said about it. There is an interesting comment by the author in page 80 about the words that Col&oacute;n puts in his journal concerning the expulsion of the Jews from Spain: \\"without a word of disapprobation (...) his apathetic words are indicative of his fanaticism. This trait he did not, however, import from Italy, which at that time was a preeminently republican and commercial country\\", says Keyserling. This is another instance where a historian captures the incongruity of considering Col&oacute;n an Italian, however in this case unconsciously. But indeed his alleged nationality has never been satisfactorily proved, only assumed. In this respect there is a more logical version for his geographic origin, this being situated in Galicia, the northwest of Spain. This more logical, as well as documented, possibility was proved by J. M. Mosqueira Manso already in the first half of the 20th century (see \\"La cuna gallega de Crist&oacute;bal Col&oacute;n\\")."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself German Verbs","review":"Great book!

She enjoyed the nostalgia, and I thought it was a nice children's story. I think that elementary school children today might enjoy it as well.Mark and Kerry, a brother and sister, are visiting Quebec with their father, who is on a business trip. Their father allows them to explore the city on their own during the day while he works (something that would be unlikely to happen in modern times). The kids enjoy sight seeing, but they are troubled by events at the quaint little inn where they are staying. On their first day there, Kerry's coat mysteriously disappears and reappears with some strange messages in the pocket. At night, Kerry hears someone crying in the next room. Is someone being held prisoner at the inn? If so, why? Kerry and Mark are determined to help in any way they can, but time is running out.The author describes the atmosphere of Quebec in some detail. The famous landmarks probably haven't changed much, although I don't know if all the descriptions are accurate anymore. I also thought it was interesting how the author includes some French phrases and their pronunciations and translations as the kids learn to communicate with French-speaking people in the city."},{"Title":"Mystery in old Quebec","review":"I bought this book to read to my kids, ages 4, 6, 7, and 9 and it was a great hit. The 4-year old didn't get it, but the others really enjoyed it. While the book lasted, it served as leverage to get them to finish their homework as I would not continue reading for the night if they had not done so.It has just enough intrigue and suspense to keep a small one interested without giving them bad dreams and the chapters are written such that there can be endless discussion about what happens next.We all had a great time and I'm looking for more books just like it."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"When I heard a movie was to be made of &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; I was jubilant not only because of the opportunity to see how the Pt. Pleasant phenomena would play out on film but because I knew the movie would bring attention to the mesmerizing, enjoyable, book, which I have owned for decades. The filmmakers wove a fictional story-structure in which to inplant just a few of the bizarre happenings reported in John Keel's book, and I feel they did about about as well as I could have hoped. I was thoroughly engaged by storyline, acting, and the kernels of Keel's theories that were retained and presented. But readers need to understand the difference between a cohesive yarn set in the present and the disjointed happenings that took place decades ago in West Va. A goodly number of reviewers of the book have picked up on Keel's contention that these spooky thingees, whether sporting wings or dressed in funereal black and not quite &quot;passing&quot; as real folks, are mutable in form but consistent in intent: they love to mess with humans. Somewhere in interdimensional space or nonspace they probably get together and cackle with glee over how to torment us next. As an orthodox Christian (an Episcopalian who believes ALL that creed I recite weekly)I happen to believe that the weird beasts and beings one encounters and all the phenomena that surrounds them like Pigpen's dust clouds during a flap such as the one in Pt. Pleasant are, forgive the non-PC term, demonic. As in from Satan--as in hanging out with the fallen angels. I'm sure Mr. Keel, and many others who've enjoyed the basic contention of the book (and movie), would be more comfortable with the less religiously charged terms &quot;psychic beings,&quot; &quot;interdimensional creatures,&quot; and similar names. But Mr. Keel, the movie, and I are all headed to the same basic idea: you should avoid these things and ignore them as much as possible. Let them in an inch, and there goes YOUR neighborhood. As in the movie, don't answer that phone; as in the immortal words of Ogden Nash, &quot;If called by a panther, don't anther!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read The Mothman Prophecies back in 1976, I just head to check out the audio book. I was not disappointed. Mr. Keel is always entertaining! I wont go into what the book is about since that information is already described. I will say that this audio book is well read by Craig Wasson - it is just an added pleasure! Very informative and entertaining! Buy this-you wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is a convincing collection of data that leads the reader towards John Keel's thesis: basically, UFOs are not from another planet. They are closer to psychic energy, and connected with some encounters throughout history with what are called monsters, ghosts, and little people. Therefore, these phenomena are truly Unknown, and probably Unknowable to the mortal human mind. If your spiritual beliefs tend towards the animist, the earth, spirits, and ancestors, Keel's ideas may resonate with you. He uncovers connections between the seemingly disparate paranormal entities mentioned above. Another of his books,The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings, is a quicker read, delving into some of the same material, but covering a broader spectrum of encounters. The Mothman Prophecies, with the higher quantity of data that fits into this novel-length book, is the more convincing of the two, because he builds his thesis slowly, using the data. Keel is not a conspiracy theorist; in fact he spends a great deal of time refuting such popular theories. If you are interested in the Paranormal, you should read this book and process your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I received this book last week and I just finished it yesterday. By the way delivery was pretty fast,I used the Amazon Prime option.I ordered this book because after watching a TV show program which talked about the so called \\"Mothman\\" it made me curious enough to make me want to know more.I bought this book because it was rather cheap and it had a few favourable reviews here on Amazon.I was looking forward to reading it but I've got to say I'm pretty disapointed with the book. I read most, if not all the reviews so I knew this book was somewhat controversial. But I was disapointed for the simple reason that from a book who's title is \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\", I would expect it to talk about the Mothman. It actually doesen't talk about him much.There's just a few lines about him at the start and then he's mentioned a few times throughout the book,and that's just about it.If the author John Keel would have entitled it \\"My weird experiences in 1966: UFO's, contactees,MIB and weirdos\\" it would have been much better and would have gave the reader or potential customer a better idea of what this book is all about.Now Keel's idea is that Supernatural occurences have all the same origin. I'm not going to discuss that here because you could find more elsewhere.But what bothers me is that this mere idea is a given fact for Keel,as if it has been totally and undoubtely demonstrated. Obviously it isn't.Now I believe in paranormal phenomena,and the book does contain some cases in which UFO's and poltergeist activity happen together in a collegated manner.But still that doesn't really prove much as far as I'm concerned, and it's certainly not enough to discount the Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis for UFO's.But that is what Keel is doing in this book.Plus he also seems to contradict himself. According to him the fact that the US Government has been active in suppressing and ridiculing information on UFO's is just a \\"cultural belief\\". The result of \\"propaganda\\" and \\"brainwashing\\",and that there is actually nothing to it. But then towards the end he states that the CIA/USAF 1953 decision to debunk and downgrade flying saucers was a responsable course of action.Anyway I'll rate this book two and a half stars because the title is very misleading. Some interesting cases are presented. If you're interested in MIB and contactees and the so called \\"high strangeness\\" scenario's this may interest you. If you're looking for facts and information on the Mothman look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel used to be a well known investigator of the paranormal, an investigator of the non-sceptical variety. \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is his most famous work.The book has been marketed as the scariest thing ever written, but is actually quite bland compared to the accounts of alien abductions and 2012 apocalypses littering the bookstalls these days. But then, it was originally published in 1975.Personally, I consider the book to be a major disappointment. Keel comes across as paranoid, a kind of real life Fox Moulder. A mysterious dwarf with an eerie alien voice comes looking for him in West Virginia. The alien dwarf calls Keel in New York. Then, the phone just goes BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. The phone company can find no explanation. And so on. The whole thing is connected to sightings of \\"mothmen\\" in the small town of Point Pleasant in West Virginia (where else?). Does somebody want to scare him from continuing the investigation? The book contains no real answers, and ends abruptly when the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant collapses, killing 46 people. At that point, Keel is so paranoid and crazy, that he essentially collapses in front of his TV. There, the story ends.Unless I'm mistaken, Sceptical Enquirer actually named the mysterious dwarf some years ago. The dwarf was a real person, some kind of practical joker and circus artist who knew Keel personally. Apparently, this very real human being was responsible for many of the \\"paranormal\\" phenomena detailed by Keel. He drove poor John mad. Of course, Mr. Dwarf couldn't have been behind the mothmen or the collapse of the Silver Bridge.SO WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE LURKING OUT THERE...Last time I heard about Keel was during the 1990's. I believe he was interviewed by Strange Magazine, claiming that the UFO phenomenon was intrinsically EVIL. We have been warned.Incidentally, the movie \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" has only the flimsiest connection to the book. I suppose that's what Hollywood calls \\"freely based on a true story\\"."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"There are plenty of other more detailed reviews about the contents of this book. Let me just say it was entertaining and you have to suspend a lot of disbelief. However, what irritated me the most was \\"where the heck were all the photos\\"? Considering the amount of time Mr. Keel spent in West Virginia/Ohio area watching the skies I can not believe he NEVER took any photos. Granted a lot of time he spent watching and sighting was at night but they had film and cameras back in the early 70's that could handle night photography. There is mention of a an individual trying to do a documentary but the cameras would malfunction or the fim would not develop properly but I found this pretty lame. There are not even any photos of the town, landmarks, roads, witnesses or any physical evidence. I found this the most dissappointing of all. Photos would have made this extremely more credible book."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Really good read. Interesting, fact finding information was researched very well.Keeps you reading, not boring at all."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I have had this book before but lost it. I loved it the first time I read it, and having read it again, I still love it. It is a fascinating, thought provoking, and entertaining book. It's author, John Keel, has been my favorite author for the past four decades."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's \\"factual\\" account of the mysterious occurrences that took place in 1966 and 1967 in the small town of Point Pleasant, WV, is both eminently readable and genuinely creepy. Through extensive interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses, Keel compiles all the data and demonstrates the connection between the appearances of the Mothman (a winged, red-eyed, demon-like apparition terrorizing the Point Pleasant populace), a serious UFO flap taking place in the area at the same time, and veiled \\"warnings\\" of impending disaster that were being expressed to the witnesses of the above in dreams.The book does tend to jump around quite a bit as Keel intersperses other UFO reports and paranormal experiences in with the Point Pleasant data to make his points. The reader will have to pay attention in order to keep all of this straight.As in most cases, the book is far superior to the film of the same name. (The movie takes serious artistic license in many cases and even changes some of the important parts of the book.) It's obvious that Keel is passionate about this subject and that he has done his \\"homework\\". After reading \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\", you may never look at the nighttime sky in the same way again."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"As many of the other reviewers have said, this book isn't in chronological order nor does it put forth any kind of explanation for the mysterious events it describes - which I myself was rather disappointed by. You can catch glimpses of what Keel might be thinking from his comments throughout - enough to know, for example, that he doesn't buy the extraterrestrial invasion theory and that he thinks that the things people see are naturally occurring phenomena that most people just aren't aware of - but he never really sits down and explains it at length, despite the wealth of information he's gathered and thought about.However, the anecdotes and experiences presented were interesting - and by the sheer wealth and similarity of them, compelling. The nonlinear format might have helped to make it interesting in some ways, even if it distracted in others."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I just finished the Mothman and found it to be a very interesting account of a rash of strange sightings in the late 1960's, centered around a town called Point Pleasant. The tales of strange men in black unable to act and look fully human arriving on people's doorsteps is chilling to say the least. There are plenty of strange sightings and weirdness documented in this novel. I can't say I believe in UFO's or Mothmen but he makes an interesting case study of what happened back then, telling of the contactees from all walks of life who supposedly saw UFO's and the hi-jinks of otherworldly visitors after they reported it.Unfortunately, there is very little about the Mothman and at times, I felt frustrated since we didn't get quite as much of he/it as I would have liked. Still its a very interesting read, it kept me glued so I gave it five stars anyway. I still found it to be one of the more interesting of UFO literature. I liked the way he wrote this book in that you can detect a tone of skepticism as well as awe of the events. No one is sure what these things are but I liked what he wrote in the beginning on their possible origins which I won't give away. He writes with a lot of humour and its very well-written. I especially loved hearing about Woody's trip to Lanulos, an interplanetary nudist colony of sorts.All I can say is that I loved this book. Keel writes with a good eye and a sense of humour. Interesting events. Spooky and fun all at the same time."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I wasn't interested in seeing the movie but the idea of the book captivated me so I was pleased when it was re-released. Unfortunately, I found the book somewhat disappointing.The premise of Mothman Prophecies is interesting but the actual execution of the book doesn't live up to the promise of the subject matter. Keel tries to include too much information and too many diverse happenings. While everything in the book contributes to the premise - that strange things did indeed happen in West Virginia one year in the mid-sixties - he never really focuses on any one aspect. Mothmen are one of many phenomena he describes. And while he gives a great deal of background on the many phenomena, he never really lets us know what he thought caused the upheaval that year. There are many case studies but very few conclusions as to the cases he encounters first-hand. And when he does cite previous studies or encounters, his sources seem a little shaky. Citing established sources is one thing but citing what I would think of as fringe publications causes me to question the validity of both his conclusions and the original source material. I do, however, understand that legitimate, well done research is produced by less established organizations and publications.While there are flaws, Keel does make the book enjoyable. It could be dry and lifeless but he injects a good sense of humor into his study keeping the reader engaged. And while you may believe nothing about what he claims happened, he does make a strong case for himself. Its hard to avoid admitting that something outside our collective realms of experience happened that year."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I saw the film years ago and loved it. I've read most of the Mothman books, so I'm surprised that I always felt a strange mental block against reading this actual book for so long (Keel might have said this was the MIB putting a thought block in my head). I am an enormous lifelong fan of both horror/scifi and ufology, as well as cryptozoology. I give this book a highly favorable review for several reasons.First off, I completely agree with the reviewers who said the book is disjointed and has the feel of Keel having slapped together his notebooks. However, Keel has such an engaging prose and an ability to take an almost objective stand on this controversial stuff, that I never got confused. Part of Keel's art is that he thoroughly convinces the reader that he saw these things and furthermore believes most of the witnesses, yet just at the right points in the narrative, he interjects a comment to the effect that everyone has it all wrong, there are no UFOs (as people understand them) and much of it is really chicanery, enough so that the reader wonders what the truth is. Perhaps this tactic is appropriate: how can we know what is real and what is not? Keel certainly doesn't profess to, and he was apparently neck-deep in it.To fans of the Richard Gere/Laura Linney movie, note that there are many differences. But you probably expected that. Everyone knows Hollywood has to intertwine a romance into everything (and they do it quite well in the film, in my opinion). But in the end I found that the spirit and the terror of the movie are all in the book as well. I will truthfully admit that for two nights in a row, I was unable to sleep with the light off in my safe, suburban home with everyone around me. The climactic tumult revolving around the terrifying Mothman and the horrid sense of doom that Keel and other contactees felt during its reign in Point Pleasant, WV prevented me from sleeping in the dark. If you love suspense and foreboding, inexplicable horror, this book ought to be a gem for you. I could not get out of my head the account of a teenage girl who saw a grinning man standing over her bed in the middle of the night!The second half is very much a delving into Keel's personal world of madness. After establishing the connection between UFOs, Mothman and mysterious Men in Black, Keel's world unravels. Suffice it to say that he feels he is being pursued and harangued relentlessly by the Men in Black. Paranoia? Draw your own conclusions.On a personal note, I was astounded and overwhelmed with excitement to see how much my native Long Island, NY figured into this book. I always assumed it would take place only in WV, but Keel actually lives in Manhattan and takes frequent trips out not just to the Island, but to my hometown of Huntington, where local legend Sweet Hollow Road and Mt. Misery figures prominently into the web of confusion spun by the ETs. Having been to that site many, many times and experienced the powerful fear in the air there, this book was sealed in my psyche as a great Fortean read.Enjoy \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\". Don't blame me if you have to sleep with a nightlight on and the curtains drawn."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is amazing! It was not at all like I expected. I saw the movie in 2003 and enjoyed it, so when I picked up the book this year I figured it would be as good or as always better. I thought it would center on a few Moth man sightings. I was very surprised to find out that it was more about UFO visitations, abductions, Men In Black, time travel, strange visitors, conspiracy theories and strange phone calls. The Mothman was only a sideshow to the main attraction! As I said in the title of the review, it is like reading the diary of a madman. You start reading and you can't believe what you are reading is supposed to be a true story. It sucks you in and you go on and on in search of answers that the author is so franticly looking for. It is disjointed and jumps around but I believe it ads a little flair to the style. I highly recomend this book and I can't wait to read John Keel's other work! I also hope someone remakes the movie as well. Not that the 2001 movie is bad, but if someone followed the book closer, the movie would make the film 12 Monkeys look soft in comparison!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"After watching the movie and being substantially moved by the piece, I decided to purchase the book and look further into the phenomeneon of the 'Mothman', and to be honest I was a little dissappointed.Although able to go places the movie was not able, providing large amounts of data and witness reports of UFO activity and MIB appearances, it seemed to lack something. The title subject of the 'Mothman' was glazed over a bit and seemingly took a back seat to the other Phenomenon that Keel investigates.I was able to move through the book at a rapid pace though, surprisingly helped by Keel's narative method of splitting the chapters into sub-chapters of no relationship. Keel does enough work to build the witness reports of those he interviews and his own eye-witness testimony, to a level by which one can only really believe them, crucial in this genre.At the end of the day 'The Mothman Prophecies' was an entertaining read that certainly leaves the reader with more questions than answers, as every good book should do. If you are looking for 'truth' then perhaps look elsewhere but, highly recommended for cold, wet nights"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel did an absolutely terrific job, researching, developing and organizing this story. I purchased the original release and read it the same day. Overwhelmed would be a good term to use here, the book encompassed all aspects of the case.Was Mothman real, imaginary or a paranormal entity ? Did Mothman truly have something to do with the collapse of the Silver Bridge? And have we seen or heard the last of Mothman? Some of these answer you may find in &quot;Mothman Prophecies&quot; if you look hard enough. Easy, enjoyable read, better than the movie !"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's ideas (now much repeated by the paranormal crowd) center around a sort of deconstructionist/quantum physics attitude applied to supernatural phenomenon.I like the creepiness, and I like how from the very beginning, Keel describes that creepiness is relative.All manner of weird things happen to poor John on his quest to find the Mothman, a large, winged being haunting Point Pleasant, W.Va., just across the river from Ohio. The process of investigation leads to Men In Black, hairy hominids, ufos and other odd flying machines and Keel leads us to believe that this bizarre process happens with every such investigation. Wild!The other great thing about the Mothman Prophecies is that the story is an arc with a beginning, a middle, and a tragic (and frightening) end. Unlike many paranormal books, Keel dosen't wade into the material as a believer. He is in disbelief even as he reveals his strange facts."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel's tome regarding the Mothman has nothing to do with the film (ok, I'm nitpicking)...more to the point, it involves itself not only with the events in West Virginia, but, also with events on Long Island and other locales.THIS IS NOT A NARRATIVE.At least, not in the normal sense. It's a story of one man's journey from skeptic to the other side....by the end of the book, Keel is not necessarily a stone believer, but he is a stone paranoid, which amounts to the same thing. He goes into the book carrying one belief system and walks out of it with quite another.This, I feel, is the actual appeal of the book. We get to witness not the transformation of a character, but the transformation of the author, which makes this not only a fascinating study, but a dangerous book indeed.And why is it dangerous? Because a researcher changed his mind? No, it is dangerous because the researcher had CREDENTIALS beforehand...he's a scholar. If Gore Vidal (the historian) told you that in his research for \\"Lincoln\\" he discovered that Lincoln liked to savage rabbits with his bare hands...would you believe me?Of course not...but the problem here is that there is no historical record to go on, that if we are to believe, we believe on the basis of our judgment of a man's character.That said, I believe he is telling the truth. I have read not only the book in question, but many other works by Keel, and I believe him to be sane. Naive, yes, often. But always he thinks about his topic. This educated man experienced something back in 1967. The question is : should we accept his account of events?I personally say yes, but that is an answer rising from years of \\"ufo's exist...\\" upbringing, along with my religious convictions.I leave it up to you.The point is, this is a book that needs to be taken not with a grain of salt, but with a full salt lick in front of you. The facts presented are merely things to be looked at more carefully. Here's hoping you do just that. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book isn't only about Mothman but also UFO, mystery lights, skin burns and such. It's pretty interesting, the retelling of the mysteriuos events, but Keel doesn't sensationize them, which leads to a fairly dry book. You can see why he stands out in his field, he's experienced these things but doesn't over embelish, draw conclusions, or try to start a religion of belief, just says this happened, and this, and that, and so on. So, while I liked the 'hard' facts, it's told in a way that loses interest. Also in the telling, he 'jumps' around a lot, here's one on day 1, here's one on day 20, here's a continuation of day 1 on day 5, etc. It's hard to stay focused on what's happening or what he is trying to do. It's not a bad book, just depends on what you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Never mind the nattering naybobs of negativity, this book is a classic. Why does Keel go into so many other subjects? Because the Mothman case he worked on was not an isolated &quot;monster&quot; invasion but an outbreak of various strange phenomena that had at its center recorded sightings of an unidentified winged creature dubbed the &quot;mothman.&quot; These sightings were part of a larger picture. Keel tells a complicated tale that requires some intelligence and imagination to understand. Without his various sidetrips there is no connection with the bridge collapse and hence no story or drama other than the individual encounters with the apparition. The movie was good but it dramatized the actual events for the sake of making a more cohesive story, just as all other movies based on books do. Take any book based on historical events and make a fiction film out of it and you'll find that certain distoritions must occur. You can't go back and blame history just because it isn't as thrilling and manipulated as fiction."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you've seen the movie, don't expect the book to be anything like it!(Which is not a new concept by far!) Although an interesting read, it's as strange as the Mothman himself, with eveything else supernatural in between! It leaves you asking yourself &quot;What in the hell just happened?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This is one of the greatest books ever written on my favorite subject: Cryptozoology. Although there is only one chapter dedicated to the Mothman itself, there are many accounts of aliens, and other \\"ulrtaterrestrial\\" beings that scared ...me. The book was tragic in a way as well, John's harrassments and the death of his friend at the end of the book. Anyway... John's wit choked a chuckle or two out of me and it takes A LOT to do that when I'm reading a book. This is a must have book for anyone! ..."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"While this book contained some interesting stories about &quot;aliens&quot; and abduction scenarios, it is also very disjointed and out of step. Keel bounces from one unrelated story to the next, and I can't for the life of me understand his ridiculous &quot;energy beings&quot; theory on UFO's; from what I could gather of his ideas, he makes people who think the dark side of the moon is inhabited by aliens seem almost mainstream. Despite my frustration with Mr. Keel's writing style and theories, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in the paranormal."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I loved this book. Anyone who is interested in UFO's, this book is a classic. Of course, since I live in the area where the story takes places, it holds a very special interest to me."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"First of all, I'll admit-I saw the movie before I read the book. Before you cast judgement, let me say that the concept of the film appealed to me very much, and certainly prompted me to read the book in hopes of learning more about this bizarre series of incidents.That's where my main criticism lies-that the book promises insight into this phenomenon, using the film as its sounding board. Very soon into the novel, however, you'll discover that Mr. Keel ventures off the topic of &quot;Mothman&quot; and more into the realm of UFOs. I remained optimistic that his stories of Men in Black and UFOs would somehow come together to support the larger theme of this &quot;Mothman&quot; , and more specifically, the tragic collapse of the Silver Bridge that was supposedly prophecised. Page after page, chapter after chapter, Keel goes off on a tangent on these UFO stories, many of which end abruptly and few of which seem very relevant.More disturbing to me was his nonchalance about these phenomena, casually stating how he'd witnessed these flying objects routinely-practically every night. He expressed virtually no surprise or awe in any of the descriptions of these rather unbelievable accounts.To go even further, I found Keel's take on these oddities to be almost egotistical. He frequently knocks other &quot;UFO buffs&quot; and indirectly implies that he's the only true authority on such matters. He also doesn't hesitate to mention the many articles, interviews, and public appearances he'd given (several times over).I found the lowest part to be when he and a colleague were viewing &quot;UFOs&quot; in a rural spot. The colleague asks him what he thinks the strange lights are doing, and Keel responds to the effect of, &quot;Well, Mary, I think they're trying to tell me something...&quot; This type of personal attachment which Keel places on the very broad phenomena he describes comes across as if the world (and then some) literally revolves around him.I finished the story feeling mislead, in that I'd read a book on UFOs when I thought it had absolutely nothing to do with them. I would estimate that only 20% of the book actually deals with &quot;Mothman&quot; and his prophecies, the rest is a self-serving collection of UFO research. I also wondered why John Keel hasn't seeked professional help..."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I just finished this book. While entertaining, sometimes gripping and sometimes even frightening, Keel's book is littered with careless suppositions. His patronizing account that Indians (Native Americans) did not possess the technical sophistication to build mounds is short on research and insulting, to boot. He cites only one out-of-date map of pre-white West Virginia, labeled 'uninhabited', as proof that the Natives were too scared to live there. Any search of the West Virginia archives will show that Native presence has a long history in that state. While published in '75, he does not correct such errors in the recent paperback's afterword, choosing only to give us a homily on the unknown. He does well explicating his files but he needs to brush up. The rotten egg smell is often caused by the pharmaceuticals that schizophrenics take. How can you discuss a 'Princess Moon Owl' character and not mention this? He says belief is the enemy of truth. This book wants to believe too much at truth's expense."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"It was about the time when John Keel flashed \\"DESCEND\\" in morse code using a flashlight toward a UFO flying overhead - and it obeyed - that I realized Mothman Prophecies was, er, somewhat questionable in ... well, just about every way.Let's start from considering the book as a purely factual account of the mysterious goings-on in Point Pleasant during the 1960s.In this regard, it's a complete mess. Nothing is in order. Events are instead grouped by topic, and used as a jumping off point to randomly drop in somewhat related anecdotes from hundreds of years of UFO lore. The whole Mothman story becomes completely obscured by incidents being written about in this haphazard way, and it makes it really hard to digest exactly what went down.And forget any sort of neutrality from Keel - he's ready to believe just about every nutcase who comes along with an outlandish story about the paranormal. Reading it from a psychological standpoint is actually an interesting exercise, in that nearly all of the people who have had experiences - sometimes repeat experiences - relate stories in which they are of some insanely huge central importance to the universe. The fact that most of them lead dull, unimportant lives in a small town is a pretty glaring note.Keel in particular is constantly on the lookout for people trying to get him. He quickly becomes the center of everyone's supernatural lives, and anytime something remotely happens, it must be part of the master plan. Pretty soon, people are coming after Keel.For a little while, he actually comes off as fairly self-conscious of how easy it is to get pulled into the world of \\"believing\\" - he chastises other UFO nuts for openly accepting every self-professed abductee that comes along, and criticizes them for hounding these poor people who just want to be left alone - and then does pretty much all that himself.I'm not a believer, I'm not a skeptic - I wanted to read about the events and make my own opinion. Good luck with Mothman Prophecies. The bottom line is that, with all the infinite amounts of crazy things that happened back in 1967 to Keel and his friends (seriously, you won't believe how much there is), there should have been miles and miles of physical evidence - tape recordings, 8mm films, photographs, etc.Instead, there's nothing. No one ever thinks to keep a tape recorder beside them. No one ever thinks to carry a camera to take photographs of the endless stream of men in black that bother everyone.Frankly, I would have excused all of this if Mothman was an entertaining read. But it's really not. What starts off spooky quickly gets tedious, and at the end, you feel like you've just spent an hour with your crazy uncle who won't stop ranting about the elves in his garden."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual &quot;mothman&quot; and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named &quot;Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink.&quot; I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is absolutely outstanding! John Keel really makes us thing out-of-the-box. You really begin to suspect that UFOs are not from \\"out there\\". What they are; no one really knows. There is something very strange going on. Some encounters with these beings are so bizarre that the mystery just keeps deepening. (See also Passport to Magonia). The Universe is most definitely much more complex that we think. I don't believe we are even close to figuring this thing out. And, that's what I love about it!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I am the author of an article for \\"The Skeptical Inquirer\\" about the origins of \\"The Mothman Prophecies.\\" The article, which appeared in the May/June 2002 issue, also may be read at the CSICOP web site.There, I describe the highly dubious role Gray Barker played in the background during the events surrounding this now-well-known West Virginia case. Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to John A. Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.Those who wonder what to believe about \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" will gain greater insight into the situation by reading this article -- but only if they truly wish to understand that there is indeed \\"more to the story.\\""},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book.

The way he described his fear got me on edge at times.But...it's crazy! It's lunacy...aside from things I would instantly argue with (i.e. the assertion that ESP has already been \`scientifically proven\` which came as news to me!) his conclusions just dont make sense at all. Forget the fact that so much of the book is hokum (I'd recommend \`Why People Believe Weird Things\` although I cant remember the author) and he seems as delusional and paranoid as some of those UFO nuts he scoffs at, he seems determined to tie everything together and completely ignore all the internal consistencies and problems posed.To really enjoy this kind of stuff you have to be a believer. Unforuntely for me I trust logic and scientific method more than anecdotal evidence. Whilst I am genuinely interested in the Turin Shroud arguments that are based on science, this is, well I suppose it's only capable of preaching to the converted or the gullible.As a footnote, there arent any *actual* \`Mothman Prophecies\` anyway?"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Garbage.

I really do. I love \\"real\\" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a \\"true believer\\" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. \\"Wow,\\" I thought. \\"That could almost be construed as logical.\\" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: \\"But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.\\"*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the \\"Good story teller\\" catagory and not a \\"ufooligist\\". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin. I must admit I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to &quot;The Mothman Prophecies.&quot; John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Another reviewer recommended seeing the movie first and reading the book second. This is a good idea as the movie is good for entertainment value and about 10% truth. Keel's book is the actual events as they took place. The book is told in a straight-forward and scientific manner. I was very glad that the author did not spend the whole time talking just about the Mothman. He also included parts of related phenomenon, such as the men-in-black. Definitely a book that needs to be read by UFO enthusiasts."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO books present their information in dates and names and places and events ... in a sense, completely without any feeling or substance beyond the 'happening.' The shocker of the ending of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES you already know if you read the 1st chapter, but, as you've been drawn further and further into the lives of the main participants, the ending hits you like a sledgehammer b/c you've spent the last 250 pages forgetting all about it. More UFO books should be written with this humanistic approach; perhaps then the subject wouldn't be so taboo."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The author puts together good information on topics that are strange and out of the ordinary. A recap of events that took place in West Virginia during a thirteen month time period in 1966 and 1967. Some of the topics covered are strange creatures, UFO's, men-in-black, and prophetic events.If you are interested in these topics then be prepared to enjoy a few evenings reading some detailed accounts of what happened to some small-town folks who were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been in the right place at the right time. In most instances the author gives a good description of what happened, where it happened, and to whom. These are details that are often omitted in stories of the same type. There are also some good accounts of men-in-black that go beyond the characters in the movie of the same name. You'll want to read the accounts of this aspect of UFO lore.If you are a UFO buff, Ufologist, or self-styled field investigator, then be prepared to be insulted. The author makes no bones about giving little credence or respect to these types of people. Presumably he and a handful of others of the same ilk are the only credible authors. A dichotomy since these are the most likely kind of people to read his book.My only disappointment in the book is that there is not enough cohesiveness to the information. The events written about seem to come together only because they occurred at the same time in the same place."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his \\"colleagues\\" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the \\"people\\" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I found this book to be fairly interesting, but at times the reader becomes bogged-down in the history of these sightings..the book would have been better reading had it focused more on a personal level and investigated the more personal aspects of how these unique sightings changed people in that town. If you expect to find the movie within the book, FORGET it, it is NOT there. Overall, lukewarm reading."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I saw the movie and had to have the book. This book is very scary leaving you grasping for the truth. I was actually scared to the point of turning lights on in my house! I am not usually a fraidy cat like that, but jeesh. Monsters can be killed. Vampires can be staked. Mummies can be burned. Ghost can be lead into the light. What do you do to ward off a creature from another dimension or time or planet that has a hot laser and ain't 'fraid to use it? Nothing as you'll read in the masterful tale of suspense and honesty. Mr. Keel will come right out and tell you when he and others are afraid, hurt, and run for their lives. This book FEELS true in many aspects. My recommendation - read this during the day and try not to think of it at night. Don't answer the door, turn off the phone (if you can), and call a buddy. This ain't your momma's UFO."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIES - Although I am a great fan of the movie, I only recently learned that the source for that film was John Keel's original book also entitled THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIES, a very interesting and enjoyable read. Until reading this book I had no idea that the legend of the Mothman was in any way related to UFO sightings as these were not emphasized in the film.Since I am a 63 year old amateur astronomer and have spent many evening hours while living in Florida, Connecticut, New Jersey as well as upstate New York scanning the night skies with my telescopes and binoculars, I am definitely not a believer in UFO stories. It is nice to hear another theory from John Keel based more on possible other dimensions, world lines and the spirit realm rather than space hardware from other planets. However, I remain more than skeptical. If we can believe John Keel's book, something very strange is going on which clearly undermines our world view of reality. Until I see an impressive UFO (or a Mothman or two) for myself I will remain a very interested skeptic, always open to hearing the latest \\"eyewitness\\" accounts.A very learned friend of mine who has passed away was a lifelong UFO researcher and believer in the hardware theory of UFO's. His great passion for the subject, intelligence, charm and professional standing as a lawyer made it possible for him to have worked with many names in the field including: Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Larry Bryant, Dr. Stanton Friedman, Ray Fowler, Whitley Strieber, and Bud Hopkins to name a few. His interest in the subject, field research and numerous public speaking engagements lasted his entire life. He was also one of MUFON' s public relations officials and always kept me up to date with the latest developments. He provided me copies of the MJ-12 documents when they were first \\"leaked\\" to the public and kept me on his mailing list for years. As a close friend, I did not have the heart to tell him that I could not buy into the hardware theory though I probably let him conclude that I did. However, my interest went as far as reading the latest \\"eyewitness\\" reports and wondering what on earth was responsible for them.This well respected individual was also very interested at one time in Dr. J. Allan Heinick, chief astronomical consultant to the US Air Force Project Blue Book. When I asked my friend what Dr. Heinick's latest findings were he reported to me that Heinick (in his senior years) was starting to believe in alternate dimensions, world lines, and possibly even spirit world theories and for that reason this friend had stopped tracking his work. He also kept me generally up to date but never mentioned John Keel's work, which I now conclude was likely because of Keel's theory in the \\"non-hardware\\" explanation of UFO's. My friend was clearly a believer in the \\"space hardware from out there theory\\" which I was not. But I always kept my ear to the ground regarding new reports of daylight disks, nocturnal lights and close encounter reports (as dubious as these may sound).As an amateur astronomer and over 50 years of carefully searching the skies in more than four states both with and without the aid of optical instruments in isolated locations, I have never observed anything which couldn't be explained in the sky. That is not to say that others have not, but I can't understand why others have been able to witness strange sights where I have not, and believe it may have something to do with \\"who is doing the looking\\", (a statement from the film taken out of context).The top rated reviewer has already said this book is almost as strange as the actual Mothman stories. Also, the fact that apparently related sightings of the Mothman, menacing MIB, numerous telephone problems, scads of prophesies from the void, as well as possible CIA escapades all read like the writings of a true paranoid. All these elements add up to make this book one of the strangest I have ever read. Mind you, I couldn't put it down for several hours a read.The chapter heading by John Keel entitled \\"Paranoiacs are made, not born\\" is also an interesting observation, causing one to question which is the cause and which the effect for any given individual. In John Keel's case I am certain his writings could be the basis of a lively sanity hearing were he a less known and less respected individual. Since his book was on the New York Times bestseller list we Mothman lovers are in good company."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John A. Keel (1930-2009)Let me set the record straight- love the book, hated the travesty of the movie. To compare the movie with the book is much like comparing ancient & modern Rome- there's a few remnants of the original here and there but not much else. This is a classic work that demonstrates how truly strange our world and minds are. From Keel's first published work, \\"Jadoo\\" onwards, I find an author that exemplifies a crisp journalistic style much like a paranormal Mickey Spillane that carries you along at an exciting pace. This is the gothic non-fictional novel of the post-modern world in which intrusions into ordinary reality remain the enigmas of a surreal universe.If you can locate a copy of the Illuminet Press version with the Frank Frazetta cover, you will be rewarded by an insightful afterword by Keel that places much into perspective after the initial events of 1966-67. Highly recommended. This is one book I read every year, waiting for a rainy weekend to escape into the wonder of an eclectic unknown."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"...Still, the book is so far the only comprehensive \\"Mothman\\" analysis from a writer who has spent time in the area. The Mothman phemomena is one that remains a mystery. Something bizarre happened in West Virginia, and it wasn't the first time. The Flatwoods Monster is another puzzling incident that happened several years before. And across the Atlanctic, not too many years after Mothman, England gave us \\"Owlman.\\" What are the connections between these, and other \\"high strangeness\\" encounters? What WAS Mothman? It is a mystery that needs to be remembered, and explored. Keel does that. This book belongs on everyone's shelf -- anyone who is interested in the paranormal.Hopefully the new edition of this title will include sources, index and the like. The inclusion of such would add greatly to this resource."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I was a truck driver from Huntington WV and had just crossed the Silver Bridge a few days before Dec 15. I remember that horrible tragedy to this day. There was some strange goings on in and around Pt Pleasant at that time. I firmly believe John Keel has just about figured it all out, (as much as humanly possible). He has a different approach as compared with all the standard UFO crap out there. This is a eye opener, with all the respectable people he talked to which he knew not to be lying. You must read this book, but pay attention because he does skip around. You will understand after you get into it that it is all tied together. VERY INTERESTING AND SPELL BOUNDING---------Al, Leesburg, Fl"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel is a true investigator. He leaves no path untread upon in his search for the truth behind the UFO phenomenon. His countless accounts of the Men in Black and their games will inform you as to their place in all of this, frighten you and even make you laugh out loud. His work helps defend the theory that aliens are inter-dimensional rather than extra-terrestrial. Even if you are not a UFO buff, this is a smooth, yet thorough induction into this strange and all too close world. Even for you non-believers, the connections made in this book will at the very least gnaw at you and most definately entertain you. It is by far the most engrossing book you may ever encounter, on many levels. It will literally change the way you look at the world and leave you with many thoughts that you may never shake. One being, &quot;I don't ever want to be visited. It's no one-shot deal!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"As someone who has enjoyed reading about UFOs and other paranormal events while maintaining an open-minded skepticism about them, I was looking forward to reading this classic 1975 book about the bizarre events in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966 and 1967. I had read a few brief summaries of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in other books, and they had usually referred to Keel's book as the standard work on the subject. After seeing the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" film (which is excellent, by the way) I bought a copy of this book. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed in the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\". This appears to be one of those rare occasions where the movie is actually better than the book. Unlike the film, Keel's book has an annoying tendency to go off on tangents - he spends the entire book simply wandering from one story to the next, with no overall theme or focus to tie the stories together.Keel reminds me of a person who starts one story, then breaks off in the middle and launches into a second, unrelated story, then breaks off the second story and starts telling a third unrelated story, and so on. Much less than half of the book actually deals with the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in Point Pleasant. The rest of the book consists of Keel's rather wild-eyed speculations and theories (which he never bothers to support with anything resembling credible evidence) of how UFOs, demons, ghosts, the \\"Mothman\\", \\"Men In Black\\", etc. are all related. Keel repeatedly ridicules the notion that UFOs might be alien spacecraft, and instead he makes the dubious argument that UFOs are \\"projections\\" from \\"energy beings\\" from a \\"parallel universe or dimension\\". Keel recounts several stories of \\"Mothman\\" sightings, creepy phone calls to residents of Point Pleasant, and the like, but he rarely offers any evidence that the stories - or the people telling them - have any credibility.A couple of examples from the book illustrate how difficult it is to consider Keel to be a serious researcher: in one passage he writes that he helped a couple to contact a UFO by telling them to go outside their home at 9 pm one night and shine a flashlight in the direction of anything \\"unusual-looking\\" in the night sky. Lo and behold, writes Keel, a large orange UFO suddenly appeared over the couple's home, and loud beeps came out of their TV set. Keel then proudly announces that he has given this same \\"insane\\" (his word) advice to many other people, and almost invariably something similar happens: doorbells ring for no reason, UFOs appear over their home, etc. It's nice to know that Keel has discovered a foolproof method for contacting UFOs. In another section Keel describes driving down a lonely road near Point Pleasant and feeling absolutely terrified along the same stretch of highway. After some \\"experimentation\\" (which involved nothing more than walking back and forth over the stretch of road where he feels terrified), Keel announces that his terror was caused by a \\"beam of ultrasonic waves\\". Given that he has no equipment to check for an \\"ultrasonic wave\\", I'm still wondering how he came to that conclusion.As for the notion that Keel is believable because he does on-site research, simply repeating other people's stories as the absolute truth doesn't qualify as research. Most credible researchers of the paranormal do background checks to try and verify the witnesses' claims, but not John Keel. Instead, he seems to believe that every person he spoke with in 1966 and 1967 is telling the absolute truth, and no further investigation is required. And the more outlandish and eccentric the story, the more Keel seems to trust the witness. I have read numerous books on UFOs and other strange phenomena which have thorough research and references to back up the writer's claims. Do NOT be fooled into thinking that Keel is a serious-minded and objective researcher, as this book is anything but serious-minded or objective. When Keel does manage to focus on the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in Point Pleasant, the book improves considerably. However, Keel's penchant for going off on tangents with one unrelated story after another, and his insistence in focusing upon himself and his theories as much as the \\"Mothman\\" sightings themselves, made this book a real disappointment. If you want to see a first-rate account of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in West Virginia, then buy the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" Special Edition DVD set and watch the excellent \\"Searching for the Mothman\\" documentary contained therein. This fifty-minute documentary, which aired on the FX cable channel, is much more believable and realistic than Keel's book."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"While Keel's book is not classy literature, even in the science fiction genre, the story is fascinating enough to keep you reading. I found this book while rummaging around in the &quot;State of WV&quot; shelves in a local bookstore. I had just moved to Pt Pleasant, WV and was interested in the local lore. I was surprised to learn that this story happened in the very town I had just made my home. I began asking the townspeople about the Mothman and found that no one would talk about it. When I would bring the subject up they would change the subject or act like they hadn't heard me. I was intrigued. I made a trip out to the TNT area where much of the story took place. Having traveled over much of the U.S., I can tell you that the TNT area is the most spooky place I have ever seen. I defy anyone to go there and not have the hair stand up on the back of his neck. I couldn't wait to get out of there and I've never gone back. The story is being made into a movie. I can hardly wait. BTW. I am 66 years old, not 12. The &quot;how old are you?&quot; function is not working properly."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Believe It or Not? Well, frankly, I don't believe all of it, though I'm sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. But in all the lengthy annals of Fortean/ supernormal/ paranoia-lit journalism, Keel does stand out as an author with an above-average storytelling ability. He also has the ability to not take himself entirely seriously, a trait often sorely lacking in the genre. With all that and a trans-phenomenon Grand Unified Theory of Weird Stuff to offer, this book is definitely worth checking out for those interested in the field."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Investigators like John Keel don't seem to exist anymore, so get this book while it's still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. It will probably never be able to compete with the books that assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient deities. People want something to believe in. &quot;Belief is the enemy&quot;,warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with, but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed..."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"You'd have thought it would be a quantum physicist, but it was the great biologist J.B.S. Haldane who said, &quot;I suspect that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.&quot; John Keel's most seminal work is dedicated to the proposition that the universe is even queerer than that. Is he for real? Is the universe for real? Did any of this mishegass, other than the briefly famous bridge collapse, really happen? I don't know; but there is no better guide into the surreal realms of &quot;high strangeness&quot; than Mr. Keel, and if you can suspend disbelief for a couple of hundred pages, you will at the very least have heard the creepiest campfire story ever told.More than any other living writer, Keel has inherited the slippery mantle of the late great Charles Fort. He shares Fort's daring, his sardonic sense of humor, his tender concern that &quot;damned&quot; facts not disappear into oblivion, his naive acceptance of every story that comes down the pike, his generous willingness to entertain any theory, and his delight in watching perverse phenomena blow every theory to smash. But if Keel's really a reincarnation, then Fort must have learned how to write during his last go-round in the Bardo, because Fort was hard slogging and this book is a zippy ride.What Keel gives us is a set-piece blocking all exits from what might as well be known as Keel's Law: &quot;Ufology is a subdiscipline of demonology.&quot; He gives us a community and a year, Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1966, where UFOs are nearly as common as fireflies, where eight-foot birds with glowing eyes engage in VTOLs without moving their wings, where Men In Black patrol the streets and synchronicities run riot, where insectoid voices control the horizontal and the vertical on phone lines AT&amp;T thought belonged to them, where contactees receive eerily precise prophecies that are wrong about everything except their specifics. Keel draws no coherent lesson from all this, except that we are cockeyed optimists if we persist in thinking of reality as coherent.Personally, I suspect that Keel's Law is right, and further that demonology is also a subdiscipline of psychology, but of a psychology that academia has not yet begun to penetrate, and would be well advised to look into carefully. (Check out Bryan's book &quot;Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind&quot;, about an abductee conference that MIT was once tricked into hosting, for some initial clues about the trail such a psychology might follow.) In any case, this book demands a place on any shelf of UFO literature, however short. It represents a nutty, true-unbeliever extreme by dint of which the rest of the shelf, the skeptical and the puzzled and the true believers alike, will be kept honest."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you're new to the paranormal and/or crytozoological studies, you should deffinately pick this up. Its light reading, so you won't have to constantly analyze if something is symbolic or not. Its written like an episode of &quot;Law and Order&quot;, really. In the book, Keel relates events that he experienced, centered around the West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Very rarely does Keel ever color the events with his view or interpritation of things. Usually he relates the facts and lets the reader come to any conclusions that need to be come to. This is very important, as usually books of the paranormal ilk are SATURATED with the authors view of what a specific event is or means. Overall, its highly enjoyable. If you are even remotely interested in paranormal phenemonons, this is a fantastic book to start with. Any conclusions you come to will be those of yourself based on the evidence provided, not because the author colored things to make it appear more one way than another. The only thing that could have made this book any better was maybe a deluxe edition that would include pictures of some of the reoccuring characters and scenes, such as Mrs. Hyre and the TNT area. Sometimes sketches of visiting entities are mentioned, it would have been awesome to see these sketches. There is a whole realm of possibilities for additional photographic illustrations to this book that could add more depth and realism. That is the only thing that could have made this book better, for what it is. However, this is just bonus material, none of it is needed to better understand the story, so there is no reason to mark down for such things not being included."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read this book umpteen times when younger, it was very interesting to skim back through it again. Back in print because of the less-than-stellar name-only movie, I was able to get it through my local library.I grew up with John Keel and his ilk. I hungrily chomped down anything Fortean, anything High Strange. Since this was back when such books were far more scarce than now, I tended to re-read the ones I had and \\"Prophecies\\" was one of my favorites.And TMP is an entertaining read, so chock-full of accounts of extraordinary flying objects, unlikely birds, monsters, poltergeists and Men In Black as to have been the inspiration for the whole run of The X-Files.Entertaining? Certainly. Serious research material? Another question.It has been at least 17 years since I last read the book. From that remove, a fresh exposure to it has a different taste. It is now in fact difficult not to view it as a paranoid fantasy.I have respect for John Keel's aspirations as a researcher. Several of his precepts have worked solidly into my thinking. A phrase early on in the book --\\"Paranormal phenomena are so widespread, sodiversified, and so sporadic yet so persistentthat separating and studying any single elementis not only a waste of time but also willautomatically lead to the development of belief.\\"-- has great resonance for me. I have seen far too many people start down the slippery slope of belief and become unable to climb back up.And Belief, as Keel famously said, Is The Enemy. To accept a belief is to wear the blinders accompanying that belief, and miss things not associated with it. Beliefs are sticky things, easy to pick up but hard to set down again.The quote above seems to support a position of investigatorial distancing from the subject, a desirable objectivity. But unfortunately for Keel's credibility he continues with the next sentence:\\"Once you have established a belief, thephenomenon adjusts its manifestations tosupport that belief and thereby escalate it.\\"That is quite a different thing from the objectivity just previously presented! \\"Get interested in weird stuff,\\" Keel is saying, \\"and not only will you become sucked in but you will be made an active focus of it.\\"TMP is full of instances of Keel himself being made the focus of \\"the phenomenon\\". Odd people come to town and ask not so much about UFO sightings, but about Keel's activities and interactions with his associates. His car is broken into and notes taken, his mail is tampered with; someone seems to be tapping his phone. On face value, the classic claims of a paranoid, only in this case it is not The Government which is doing it but Someone Else, the Agents of The Phenomenon.Even the title smacks of delusions of grandeur: where there are \\"prophecies\\", there must be a \\"prophet\\", and the attentions Keel say were paid to him would prove him to be such an important personage.A simultaneous problem and attraction of TMP is the wealth of anomalous reports with which Keel supplies us. In Keel's universe anomalous events are happening so continuously as to make those who are not witnesses feel inadequate. In the quote above he calls paranormal phenomena \\"sporadic\\" but you wouldn't know it from this book - unusual events are so constant as to not be unusual. Just as pornography may have the effect of leading you to believe that everyone else on the planet is having more and more-varied sex than you, so does \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" make one feel unstudly for not having extraordinary paranormal experiences nightly.\\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is a landmark book in many ways. It helped to associate in the public's mind UFO reports with other paranormal activities such as monsters and poltergeists. (Just as Jacques Vallee's \\"Passport to Magonia\\" associated UFOs and fairy belief, in a more scholarly way.) TMP helped to standardize the image of the Men In Black, with results familiar to any moviegoer or X-Files fan. It gave us The Mothman, a critter right out of nightmare, resurrected by the movie to the degree that Mothman reports are now retroactively presented after major disasters.But upon re-visiting this book, I have to feel that it is has less value as a representation of the events of the day, and more value as a record of one man's fascination with, and descent into, a particular form of belief. All the more ironic since Keel warns us against that belief even as he embraces it."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The movie was good but forget about connecting that flick to this book. This book was first written in 1975 - NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO! If you have ever read \\"true story\\" UFO books before, then you have probably come across a lot of recent material that seems more plausible like \\"The Gulf Breeze Sightings by Ed Walters\\" and \\"Fire in the Sky: The Walton Experience by Travis Walton\\" but both of these books have since had their day - they have been pretty much debunked and are widely known as absolute hoaxes, if not downright fabrications at best. After 30 years, The Mothman Prophecies is still a SOLID story because of the amount of witnesses to the events, biological medical evidence and the final catastrophe that ended the phenomena. The only case that debunkers have against this story is that the Mothman could be an owl or a large species of crane, but eyewitnesses deny that it is any such animal.In fact the Mothman is not part of any category of cryptozoology. Much like the chupacabra, it is a zoological impossibility so the only possible realm of existence for this thing is genetic experimentation, an apparition or extraterrestrial. The latter category is what the Mothman falls into and this book is all about just that.Keel went to Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1966 and 1967 to investigate a series of unexplained happenings that the towns people where experiencing at the time. Most importantly was the sighting of a creature that could only be described as some sort of a flying monster. This creature, dubbed the Mothman, was new to Point Pleasant but not to the history books and so Keel went digging around to see what he could find. While doing this he unearthed an astonishing amount of information on this mythical beast. At the same time there was some UFO activity in the area and Keel was the one who made the connection between the Mothman and the UFOs.Essentially \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is a book that documents and reports on a HUGE UFO FLAP in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Coupled with this event where strange lights in the sky, encounters with the unknown, men in black, psychic phenomena, cattle mutilations and an impeding of Keels investigation by possible secret government agencies. Keel is only one of many people that where exposed to these events and although the book must be treated skeptically, it does open your mind because there is simply too much activity taking place to call it a hoax or work of fiction. Various people seemed to be attacked by the Mothman. Even an ambulance used for blood donation was chased and attacked by the thing. In short this is an excellent UFO book that still stands the test of time.For years we have been waiting for its re-release and the movie has helped spur that along. When you compare this book to other true stories about UFOs you really begin to appreciate its value. I have read a lot of UFO books and books about strange encounters but this is the one that really got me gripped from start to finish. After reading this book it is very hard to see it as anything less than real and truthful. \\"Occam's Razor\\" tells us that in explaining a thing no more assumptions should be made than are necessary - but when applied to this book you must explain how everything occurred in this one region to so many people. Keel not only researches the Mothman but documents everything that happened at Point Pleasant during that fateful period of time.It is a whopping story that is highly intriguing, absolutely baffling, horrific and extremely hard to dismiss as a work of fiction. It is not until you see the Mothman documentary that is on the movie DVD that you actually get to put faces to the people in this book and hear them talk about their experiences. This is first rate investigative reporting and an amazing story to boot that can't simply be dismissed as all in Keel's mind, or a hoax or fabrication. Strange things went on in Point Pleasant, West Virginia and the people where scared. Then it ended with a massive tragedy and the supernatural phenomena stopped. There is no doubt that something completely out-of-this-world occurred at Point Pleasant and you should not miss reading about it.Exceptionally riveting journalism!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel is a true investigator.

Even if you are not a UFO buff, his book is an easy yet extremely thorough initiation into this world. And even for you non-believers, it is recommended reading.

Lie awake nights listening to Art Bell? Do you get an eerie feeling that something significant is happening when spooning mashed potatoes onto your plate? This book will either set your mind at rest or scare your socks off, possibly a little of both.Yes, we've been visited, but not by creatures from Venus trying to warn us about nuclear proliferation, though you may be abducted, and an anal probe is not completely out of the question. This is an investigation of sightings, in the vicinity of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, during 1966 and 1967, of UFOs and many other strange things, including a ten-foot-tall, black, winged devil-bat creature with glowing red eyes that terrorized people in lonely farmhouses (\\"Mothman\\"). Not to mention Men in Black who showed up next day to warn witnesses to keep quiet. The string of incidents culminated with a bridge collapse (depicted melodramatically in the movie of the same name), after which the visitations stopped.Keel's account of his stay in Point Pleasant, his interviews of witnesses, and his own encounters is all too credible. To make any sense of this, the only thing I can conclude is, there is a semi-intelligent force on our planet that has been manifesting as \\"lights in the sky\\" and making mischief, some of it lethal, for millenia. In each age humans fasten on the explanation that most closely parallels current superstition, science, or popular culture, whether it be flying saucers and Roswell, witches riding broomsticks lighting their way with lanterns, or gods, pans and centaurs flitting through forests. The forces or intelligences (OK, call them demons) seem willing to play their part, adapting to the zeitgeist.Periodically an individual is singled out for \\"illumination,\\" usually at a lonely crossroads. That lucky person founds a cult, gathers followers, and the whole thing ends with a bunch of people on a mountain top waiting for the mothership, which never shows up, unlike that Spielberg movie.Studying these phenomena is exactly what can attract these demonic creatures to you, so the best advice is, ignore the whole thing, and for heavens sake don't read this book.Just kidding.

There's a revolution in the understanding of paranormal events, ufology, cryptozoology, and the like. Amazingly, most of the subject matter I've read on these topics throughout my lifetime CAN be FAR better understood using this POV. I suggest any and all who have interest in these topics start studying: Patrick Harpur's \\"Daimonic Reality..\\" and George P.

I'm not sure if all of this actually happened, but if it did then I'm sold!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I don't know quite what to make of this book, because I don't know quite what to make of the events that occured in West Virginia (and Ohio and Long Island, among other places) in the late 60's. The story is probably well-known if you've seen the movie. The book does differ somewhat from the movie but this isn't exactly a linear tale. I did read that Keel was pleased with the results.In brief, in the late 60's a lot of peculiar events took place in the area around the Ohio/West Virginia border centered around the town of Point Pleasant, WV. Most of the events involved sightings of the Mothman (whose name was coined from a Batman villain) but there were various other Men in Black types running around Point Pleasant too. Other events are too numerous to mention and seem to involve lots of peculiar folk showing up on people's doorsteps and beeping phonecalls and maybe an abduction or two. The events culminate in the collapse of the Silver Bridge. Despite some criticisms of the book (the reason for the Bridge collapse had a scientific explanation), Keel does not suggest that the tragedy was caused by the Mothman, et al. He simply suggests that these visitors knew about it and purposefully misled him and others. How did they know? Keel thinks they are time-travelling visitors from another dimension that come here for purposes unknown and maybe unknowable, although possibly just because it amuses them. It all sounds fairly ridiculous when you try to explain it. Keel seems reasonable and he's well-respected by his peers (his peers, granted, probably including some rather flaky folks.)The book is well-documented and not especially sensationalistic. I actually grew tired of the repeated stories of odd occurences at crossroads and a seemingly endless parade of unexplained lights in the sky. It is short and worth a read if your interest was especially piqued by the movie or you just have an interest in this sort of thing, in which case adjust the rating upwards. Otherwise, this book probably isn't for you. Do be prepared to be haunted by Keel's final words (a quote from Charles Fort, a famed student of the unexplainable): \\"If there is a universal mind, must it necessarily be sane?\\""},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you're into the strange and unexplained,UFOs,strange creatures,then John Keel will never disappoint you.This book provided hours of pleasant reading but it should've been named &quot;My ordeal with the Men In Black&quot; because the actual material involving the Mothman is miniscule compared to the frightening ordeal he describes involving the MIB."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"...And this is my story. I've been there and seen it. Even Mormon History circa mid-1800's includes the unexplained occurences so well depicted in this book.

This is Twin Peaks FOR REAL!!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I still cant believe this book was turned into a movie. Though the movie didn't capture even 5% of the scariest moments in the book. This book could easily change your perspective on UFO's and monsters forever. Despite the fact that this could be John Keels most unpolished work it is perhaps the most ground breaking too.If you are the type of person who can believe that scores of people would frantically contact local authority and the press to foolishly report a rare stork with red eyes then this book isn't for you. A 7-ft leathery gray humanoid with glowing red eyes and a huge wingspan that flies fast enough to chase cars down is not something dozens of people are mistaking for anything else.I almost didn't buy this book years ago when I first heard about it. It just seemed too fantastic. When I finally picked it up I was stunned by all the 1st hand experiences of the author.The first Wednesday after I read the book I looked outside my house for UFOs. An old school Cadillac rolled by and made a turn at the end of my block, which would force it to back track. The windows were black. Nothing else happened. When I got back inside I had a message from my best friend. He was somewhat frantic. He said: \\"Dude, I just heard a really weird UFO whirring sound outside of my house.\\" His girlfriend heard it too, and she told him in an uncharacteristic manner: \\"better go tell your friend what just happened\\" I hadn't told him what I was reading (or anyone else) and I never had a serious discussions about UFO's with him before that event."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"There is a lot about the 60s' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm movie cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of \\"Mothman\\" and I simply cannot accept the author's statement that all those camera's that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other.The movie was excellent but then it was not based entirely on this wacky book which is written in kind of a random fashion and is not all that good in the first place. \\"Show me the pictures.\\""},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I saw the movie and was intrigued enough to read the book, which I thought would maybe give a better idea of what really happened in West Virginia that year. I was disappointed to find that Mr. Keel spent a lot of time dwelling on UFO encounters and the history of UFO encounters and spent little time talking about the events in West Virginia, other than how it blended with the history of UFO-logy. The movie was more interesting, and I don't know how they developed a movie based off of this book. I didn't buy the book to read about Air Force involvement (or maybe lack thereof) in UFO sightings or about how Mr. Keel had been hunting UFOs and UFO witnesses. A big letdown."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I like reading from time to time about unexplained phenomena. Why have I bought this book ? - it is another unexplained thing to me; probably happened because I noticed that motion picture had been made based on this story.What a flop it is !There is hardly any action in this text and I can't imagine how somebody was able to create anything suitable for big screen.Book is simply boring, nothing but repetitive descriptions of very old, supposedly true experiences and \\"facts\\" related to strange lights, poltergeists, UFOs, Men In Black and other encountered critters. Whole information is presented in a very chaotic and mixed up way. Facts are taken from all kind of local trashy newspapers, old UFO magazines and questionable at best police reports, as if these were proof of anything.Besides, today in XXI century, after more than 40 years (book was published in 1975 and tells about events taking place in 50es and 60es), UFO and paranormal researchers try different approaches and changed their attempts to explain \\"unexplained\\". Views presented by the author are simply nave, outdated and archaic.He crammed in the same sack: angels, Beelzebub, MIBs, flying dragons, vampires, robots, haunted places, creatures from different spaces and dimensions, ancient history, believes and you name it.\\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is good for kids, grade 7 max, who like intriguing horror stories but not for adults who like to read more serious stuff about strange and unknown happenings.I had enough of this rubbish in the middle of it and tossed this book into the garbage.Luckily it was cheap.

This is certainly not your run of the mill type book that follows a movie release."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I bought this book on impulse seeing that it took place in West Virginia where my son is in college- a mom thing, that is, not a UFO thing. It scared me more than I'd bargained for. It isn't the UFO mystery- the saucers were cinematically graceful and playful and so abundant that it was like watching migrating birds. No,it was what happened down on the old \\"nitrogen, oxygen and cosmic spit\\"- formed earth that freaked me out. I read alone and late at night.The strange men- later called men in black and MIB, visited people living in remote areas- WV in the 60's- young pregnant women, an elderly man who ran home for his shotgun and a divorced woman on a farm where the cattle were drained of their blood. One of her son's told the author, yeah, his mom was really upset when she saw those lights outside. Frankly, had they come to me- I'd be outta there so fast and Never go back. Get a gun? I don't think so. These people- and I guess that's how a book gets written- would go out on midnight walks down deserted roads- oh no! And when you knew these 'things' were out and about? Writing this, it seems more contrived than it did during the reading- I mean even if West Virginia was a low stat crime state- who would walk down dark, deserted roads, when there was no moon and you know Mothman had been cited flying up and staring with his large illuminated red eyes. Sometimes, those eyes would lazer people into paralysis and later vomiting and other illnesses. The UFO's could turn a light on you, or even one of their visitors could somehow leave you with a checkerboard burn that left and returned again with no medical rationale. Kids love those Scary Stories collections and they are often old mountain folk tales, perhaps this was just a modern sort of scariness en masse. (And later, for profit.) Anyway, it got to me. I think when deciding to believe or not, it is often the author's voice, that makes the difference. And I found Keel to be a semi-self effacing and overall 'normal' narrator which did keep me reading when otherwise I'd have quit. If you are the sort that either has an interest in the paranormal, or you just enjoy a good dose of fear and foreboding- not me, for sure- then I'd say read the book. I was interested in the previous reviewers' personal revelations and think they are important antidotes, especially from someone who hyped the stuff at one time. Prophecies' author, Keel, discusses how those that he interviewed were not on the surface seemingly capable of carrying out such a well-entwined ruse- and that was also my reaction. But when reading how easily a smart, creative fraud can really incite some interest and corroboration; that also is needed to balance the oftentimes extremely schizoid fervor and longing for more chaos in our existence. I remain doubtful- and if not that, hopeful that they don't come anywhere near me cause I am not the one!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"As an investigative record of bizarre experiences, some first hand, The Mothman Prophesies is as timely and interesting a read now as it was when it was first published almost thirty years ago. I disagree with some of Keel's conclusions, at least with respect to them being the final word in what is obviously an ongoing puzzle, but he points to some very interesting possibilities. His notions are well worth adding to the soup of the still bubbling mystery that such bizarre experiences as Mothman, MIBs, strange aerial lights, odd electrical and poltergeist effects, etc., represent.That much if not all of what is reported is Earth-related does not lessen the difficulty of asserting categorically that &quot;extradimensional&quot; beings are entirely localized. The possibility of worlds without end lie that way, whether connected by wormholes or whatever in this dimension or in other layers outside of this one. I'd bet John a bottle of HERRADURA SELECCION SUPREMA tequila that our multilayered universe is full of life in many forms, mostly unexpected, and that this will become obvious far sooner than later (in the next hundred years at least).-- Randy"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Frightening and endlessly facinating. I couldn't put it down. I read this book ten years ago in its original paperback printing. And have never forgotten it. This book ignited a lifelong search for answers in a pandora's box of riddles. John Keel is a pioneer and visionary. This book was originally published in the 1970's and remains a seminal work in ufology. And nothing published since comes close to the intricacy, mystery, horror or the engaging, and sometimes humorous writing style of the great Mr. Keel. I look forward to reading it again and again. This is a must read. 10 Star rating. A major Hollywood movie is in pre-production. They will probably screw it up. They've already fabricated a Mrs. Keel, who doesn't exist. THANKS A ALOT HOLLYWOOD."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book was great! If you aren't sure if you believe in these tyes of things, you will after you read this! It'll make you look at strangers in your hometown with a whole new perspective. If you've ever had anything crazy happen with your telephone, this book will really make you wonder what happened! And it's true - the movie was horrible and has nothing at all to do with the book! Read this book and forget about the movie!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is not only fascinating, but informative. John Keel's book is suspenseful. I never knew much about what happened in Point Pleasant until I read this book. The movie is not even close to the greatness of the book. Mothman was actually called mothman off of a villain's name on Batman. In the book, the couple who answered the door for John Keel (John Klein in the movie) died in the Silver Bridge Tragedy.There are many interesting facts in The Mothman Prophecies.I think that this is a good book for Ufology fans.I very strongly disagree with anyone who gives this book a low rating.If you want to learn about MIB's,UFO's,Mothman,strange creatures, and Tulpas (mind projections), this is a good book to teach you all about these areas."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read most of John Keels's other UFO-paranormal books I was still not prepared for the knock-out dramatic conclusion to this one. I've read some other reviews in here and they seem to be all over the place. What you need to know about John Keel is that he investigated and traveled around the world to the sites of as many UFO and paranormal events as he could to see where the event took place and meet the people involved. This is in contrast to some of the so called 'investigations' made by the Air Force's Project Blue Book and armchair UFO investigators who often relied solely on second hand information. This quest was combined with a keen insight into the underlying nature of UFO and paranormal phenomena. For that reason I trust his opinions and speculations more than any other researcher out here. Keel also used news clipping services as all UFO writers do, to locate sightings and correlate information from everywhere to help piece the whole paranormal puzzle together. Information is a good thing. Information that is checked out is even better. Keel also did not try to exclude certain information that seemed too bizarre or that might not support the 'extraterrestrial' hypothesis that the old school of UFO research is obsessed with. This is one of the very best books ever written on the UFO and Paranormal subject and is considered a classic. I highly recommend both this and all of John Keel's UFO books."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel is the prototype for the serious investigator of the paranormal. He combines just the right combination of skepticism and open- mindedness, along with a genuine sense of the absurdity yet reality of the situation he's dealing with. This book deals with one of the most famous series of incidents in the annals of Forteana or the paranormal, the &quot;Mothman&quot; incident or incidents which took place in a rural area of West Virginia in late 1966. Keel describes the seemingly unbelievable sequence of events with wry detachment. At the same time he conveys a sense of dread and fear in the face of incidents for which there is no rational explanation. Keel is probably the closest we have to the most famous and probably best chronicler of the strange and bizarre, Charles Fort. More than anything else, this book reminds us of what Shakespeare said, &quot;There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The great thing about this book is it works as a nonfiction book, if you're a believer and as a book of fiction, if you're a nonbeliever.If you believe in UFO's and monsters, the interviews with the people sound very sincere and convincing.If you don't believe in the subject, the book reads like a good horror novel with a tragic ending which is based on a true event"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Ok, we have seen the movie, some of us have read Keel's book (this being a reprint). What no one seems to mention is the fine print located on the copyright page, which reads: \\"This is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously.\\" If you don't believe me, glance at the copyright page. Obviously, this paperback edition was prepared as a movie tie-in. Touted as a \\"true event\\" the publisher then informs us it is all a work of the \\"author's imagination.\\" And therein must lie a lot of truth. Yes, the book is mildly entertaining, if a bit choppy in parts. My advice is, read THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with a large dose of salt (and the movie is much better)."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is very informative and worth a read if you're interested in this legend and the multiple events that took place. However, I must say the book is unorganized as it seems to jump from story to story and repeat itself in some details and events. All in all I thouroughly enjoyed this book though."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is one of the few books that I've felt compelled to read several times. It's scary, thrilling, and intensely interesting, at least to a \\"paranomal\\" buff such as myself. And all of this in a nonfiction book. Perhaps truth really is stranger than fiction!It seems some people don't like John Keel's writing style, as it seems rather scatterbrained. I believe this is deliberate, as the different subcategories of subject matter, such as the men in black, UFOs, the Mothman itself, etc., are touched on briefly, repeatedly intertwined with other subcategories of phenomena that were encountered during Keel's Point Pleasant adventure. This sylistic decision necessitated a temporally scattered book, in the interest of spreading out the aforementioned, varying subject matter.The less informed typically negatively assess the eyewitness reports given in this book. Yes, it is odd that these alleged extra-dimensional beings possess a mixture sophisticated technology, and patently unsophisticated, contemporary human technology of the time. It isn't right to lambaste Keel or his interviewees over this subject matter of their testimony. The mixture of the low and high tech has been seen in most UFO contact cases of the last 130 years. Ultimately, this supports the theory, unpopular with many of the tinfoil hat wearers who give UFOlogists a bad name, that the UFO phenomena have probably absolutely nothing to do with aliens.There are many strange features of the varied stories in this book. If you keep an open mind, you may find them just as entertaining as I do!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Books about the paranormal I never find to be entirely satisfying; you get teased and left to make up your own mind. I get drawn to this kind of material for some reason, always hoping to get some answers, to figure it out, to fit this into my theistic worldview. A year ago I got my first taste of satisfaction, from the book \\"Lights in the sky and little green men\\", in which the authors concluded that residual UFO's, the ones that cannot be explained away, are in fact real, but are not physical but spiritual.John Keel, with The Mothman Prophecies, arrives at a somewhat similar conclusion. He scoffs at the idea that these are visitors from other planets, but is less convinced that they are from the spiritual realm, at least as commonly understood by Christians. His bizarre thirteen month set of experiences centered on Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966-1967, culminating in the tragedy of the bridge collapse, has left him certain of nothing. He does seem to see a continuity between paranormal experiences throughout history and those of today, with poltergeists, demons, Bigfoot, Nessie, UFOs, and Men in Black all falling under the same explanatory umbrella, whatever that may be. Possibly an independent spiritual world exists, or possibly these are psychic imprints and pollution, echoes that play back in certain geographical locations, like a record stuck, playing back the same groove over and over.You are not going to get closure from this book, but his account is gripping and his speculations are thoughtful and intelligent. To repeat an overused phrase, you are not going to want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"When I was a kid, I collected all sorts of books on the supernatural and unexplained. UFOs, Bigfoot, ghosts, the Loch Ness Monster. There was no mystery that didn't interest me. One of the books I found was called THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.Growing up in Southern Ohio on the Ohio River, I didn't take much interest in this book. Probably because it read like a jumbled mess of monsters, UFO sightings, Men in Black, etc., and that the idea of a moth-man monster flying through the skies just down the river from where I lived sounded preposterous (even to a wishful, wide-eyed kid).I didn't read the book until after they'd made the recent film with Richard Gere and Laura Linney. The movie manages to pull the creepiest moments but it didn't quite work either. (My major complaint remains that you can't have a monster movie and never give us a good look at the monster).But I read the book and found it alternately interesting and amusing. Keel does a good job of taking the most outlandish elements of his \\"investigation\\" and blending them into a logical procession of ideas (if not always a logical story).It's fun if you don't take it too seriously. I still enjoy the creepy thrill of mystery at the edges of our shrinking world...no matter how far-fetched and outlandish they sound. The Mothman of West Virginia certainly falls into that category.The creature has taken on a life of its own. There's a 12-foot statue of the Mothman (it looks more like reptile-like Sleestak from \\"Land of the Lost\\" than a real Mothman) standing in Point Pleasant, West Virginia and a museum I hope to visit someday. Documentaries play on the Travel Channel and on youtube.com about the legend. I just saw there's a festival for the Mothman in Point Pleasant this month (Sept) so I'll have to check that out sometime if I'm back that way during that time.For more info, check out the 5-part \\"The Search for the Mothman\\" on youtube and definitely the 3-part \\"The Mothman Debunked\\" also on youtube.com."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Upon my initial reading of this book one thought came to my mind: &quot;confusing&quot;. There wasn't anything even remotely like a &quot;stroy&quot; going on, but rather a mishmash of facts, and experiences from a number of individuals related to the phenomenon known as the mothman, the MIB, and UFO encounters.After having saw the film, I then took another chance to read it, and found it to be fascinating in the way that I believe that Keel had intended for it to be confusing (this is due to a scene in the film where one of the characters utters &quot;We aren't supposed to know what they mean...&quot;), and I give him the utmost respect for it. He has created a book that is both unsettling, and highly enjoyable (it reminds me of the feeling I got when I first read Burrough's &quot;dope&quot; manifesto &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;)This is one of those books where all things aren't supposed to make sense, and where you are supposed to get your own interpretation from the &quot;prophecies&quot; contained within. Whether a work of fiction, or non-fiction, &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; is a fascinating read, and a good primer to the world of UFOs, MIB, and cryptozoology. I definitely recommend this to any fan of the paranormal."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is fascinating reading. It 'rings true to me'. Mr. Keel tells the reader when he's scared, looking for more information or not sure what he's seeing. I think he's very up front and honest.There is much I think that can be learned by Mr. Keel's experiences and interviews. Men In Black, Ufo's, and strange sounds are all in this book. Monsters and mysteries that prove we don't know everything on this Earth and in this universe yet.My one big complaint and why it's rated a four rather than a five is that many times Mr. Keel gets off track in his writing. This leaves the reader a bit confused and forced to back track at times. Further, I find many times I would have been going back to find more information and it doesn't seem he does that, at least not in the book. This is frustrating for me. I'd like more information, more about the interviews he conducted etc.Not a bad book over all. Just a few not so positive thoughts on it. I enjoyed it and read it in about two days.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I have never been interested in UFO literature, but decided to give this book a try. The early portions of the book are rather dry documentations of UFO sightings and other paranormal incidents. Towards the end of the book however, things pick up considerably. The author's description of events is credible and eerie. He concludes that so-called 'extraterrestrial' beings are really with us here on Earth but only perceived by those with perceptual abilities that most of us do not have. He also concludes that such beings are capable of influencing and interfering with humans. For books outside of the UFO literature that corroborate Mr. Keel's conclusions I recommend 1) The Active Side of Infinity (Carlos Castaneda), 2) Far Journeys (Robert Monroe), 3)The Path (Esmeralda Arana)."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The classic on stange phenomena and the paranormal written by the man who was there.

I was pleased when it was reprinted as I had wanted to read it again. It holds up surprisingly well. Keel had realized things about the 'UFO phenomena' then that most other researchers are only now beginning to understand. If you have a sense of wonder, get it. If you are a researcher, get it. If you are an open minded skeptic, this will give you a better perspective. If you're just looking for entertainment, it's a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The book is a disjointed account of many &quot;sightings&quot; of different phenomena.

Very little is mentioned about the mothman compared to UFOs, MIB, stange lights and cattle mutations. I did find Keels thoughts on vampires, angels and UFOs being all from the same entity very interesting. I kept finding myself wondering if Keel was overly paranoid, however this may well be the point. Are all people who encounter UFO's paranoid or are there powers at work that make them and us think they are paranoid? Now, I'm sounding paranoid! Because of this book, I will continue to read on UFO's , and for that reason I liked the book."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Good read.

Keel has been around a long time and I personally think he is one of the most underrated authors of this century.

This book's are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title. There's hardly anything about &quot;the mothman&quot; in it."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you liked the movie, don't buy this book! It was the worst compilation of meandering thoughts that I have read since, well, since ever. This book left me wondering: &quot;Huh?! What were you thinking?!&quot;But, if you are the ever true believer in MIB (not the movie), black helicoptors, and cow mutilations, this just may be the book for you. If you will accept an explaination for parnormal events, presented in a matter of fact form, as truth, without further explaination as to how such conclusions are reached, then you will accept, probably love, this book. However, for me, a reasonable person, wishing for education, not blanket belief, this book is nothing more than a waste of money. I would gladly send you, dear reader, this book for free, saving you the cost of purchase, but the shipping fee is too great a cost, considering that I may use the book for fuel for a fire to warm me on a cold winters night...It reminds me of the great words of Eric Cartman: &quot;Well, they took me up in their spaceship, and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye&quot;. Your pinkeye, Mr. Keel, was probably caused by rubbing your eyes too much...trying to stay awake while creating such garbage."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman.

Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I approached this book with a fairly open mind, expecting to read an interesting story about the strange events of 1967. Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, \\"ufo\\" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this &quot;nonfiction&quot; book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Let me just start by saying that the &quot; MOTHMAN PROPHECIES&quot; is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you are looking for a great story that will really drag you into it, don't read this book. Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters. There is not an ounce of structure to this. It's just a bunch of thoughts and \\"reports\\" of sightings of UFO's, \\"mothmen\\" and other oddities. I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel. I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance. All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!?!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's \\"weird\\" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.\\"Mothman\\" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I. HISTORY A lot of &quot;the unexplained&quot; books today got their inspiration from pioneer books like this one. I read this book several times in middle school &amp; now many (though not all) of its theories have been confirmed with the knowledge I possess today. NOT recommended for immature readers.II. PLOT Keel's bold &quot;documentary&quot; not only grips the reader because the physical events ACTUALLY occurred, but also because the book was written during a time when MIBs, aliens, &amp; &quot;mystery monsters&quot; were politically INcorrect. Now everyone is jumping on the &quot;UFO&quot; bandwagon.III. CHARACTERS The characters *are* or *were* real. Although Keel was a UFO journalist &amp; therefore has a biased view, the events, interviews &amp; conversations actually occurred AND he was there when much of it happened.IV. THE UNEXPLAINED Keel offers a refreshing hypothesis behind the nature of the &quot;unexplained&quot; &amp; &quot;unscientific&quot; events which STILL occur. Although *many* components of his theory are off-key, his theories including the observations that UFOs are &quot;primarily psychic in nature&quot; &amp; come from &quot;inner space vs. outer space&quot; are not far off base. And Keel is a nonChristian!V. REALITY WAKE UP AMERICA &amp; skeptics! Even the Bible &amp; world religions (which DON'T support the Bible) testify to this. If modern-day mediums can conjur up spirits, if psychics have &quot;spirit guides&quot; that tell you your personal 411 when many of you dial the psychic hotline, if Tibetan monks can create &quot;tulpas&quot; or manifested thought-forms, if cameras suddenly jam when &quot;mystery creatures&quot; are about to be photographed &amp; UFOs can alter human consciousness, then maybe their nature IS more non-physical than physical. And maybe DUH!, they ARE similar in origin.Final thought: A person that only reads books on what they already know is *wasting their time.*"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The author claims the book is factual.

Honestly, I say avoid this like the plague."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Well John boy at least got to have a movie made from his book, so I guess he died happy, knowing he was able to use double talk and vague if not downright deceptive practice's to pull the wool over the ufonut communities eyes.(Keel tosses out the tidbit that this part of America was NEVER settled by native Americans while all areas around it were. Bull, this part of West Virginia was HEAVILY lived in and settled by indians)OK so here it is. Mothman has nothing better to do than fly around a remote area of the Ohio Valley in 1966-7 and then make a bridge collapse. There are 50 states and millions of people that mothman could have messed with, but he decides to pick on poor 'ol West Virginia.We're lucky though, because John Keel is on the case, and those mean, evil, nasty, bad guy/monster's don't know who they're dealing with.So here we have Mr Keel and he is an expert in all thing's paranormal, and he can't get one simple photograph of all those light's he saw while in West Virginia? John Keel want's the reader to see that it's ALL about HIM and we listen to his stories about the phone taps and the men in black and we can't get a single thing in writing from the phone company to confirm his phone problems, and despite being in an area of the country that has a heavily armed private citizenry, not one of those Asian looking men in black is shot or held at gun point while the local police are called. Hmm?We are regaled of the nightly ufo flights that John sees, but not a single photo. John tells of a movie maker who comes down to film, but you guessed it. No photo's. Those insedious mothmen seem to destroy every picture taken of them. They tease us with \\"accurate\\" predictions, only to give us lies later on. The fact that all we have is John Keel's word about the accurate predictions, since we only get them AFTER the fact, leaves a bit much to the credulity of the reader.John gives us his ideas about the different dimensions that things exist on and says that mothman comes from there. We are given his expertise on what is real and what isn't. Once again we are required to assume that John is an honest broker. Sorry, don't buy it.This book takes place in 1966-67 and wasn't first published until 1973. We had to wait for Richard Gere and his movie to come out before the story came back on the public radar and we got the book re-issued.Needless to say most of the things Mr. Keel claims to be true cannot be verified by any independent source or source's. After all this time an industry has grown up around mothman and where there is money to be made, you can bet that a small thing such as the truth or facts are quickly destroyed on the altar of commerce and glitz.How any sane or rational person can read this book and buy into it without ANY reservation says something about the kind of people we have in the world today. I wish mothman would come and get them."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying &quot;distracted&quot; attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an &quot;investigator&quot; he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Although I realize at the time it was written, politically correct descriptions of people were not the same as today, yet some of these things are too strong to be overlooked.

However, other points that need to be identified are: He finds strange pieces of wood in people's phones, people who claim their phones are bugged, but he doesn't keep the strange object? He sits in his car and witness several UFO going overhead, with a film camera beside him, yet forgot to take any footage. A UFO comes within yards of him and some viewers and he shines a \\"spotlight\\" on them (so convenient he just happened to have one handy), the UFO takes off and the only thing he can say was \\"guess I blew it\\" when most people would be on their knees in astonishment. He claims to have kept these facts secret until the publishing of the book, so as to not create hoaxers. He waited to published the book after the bridge collapse?If John Keel was selected to be a contactee as he claims. Then why did he get such laughable feedback from the aliens? Wouldn't the aliens be technologically advanced, much more than earthlings. Then how come they failed to know there are more than 9 planets in our solar system and other heavenly bodies in it as well. Why did the UFO's have \\"frosted glass\\" windows and bucket seats? Such a painstakingly tacky reminder of the period in which the book was written. A definite retro look. Why would the aliens refer to phonographic records? They could travel thru time but their most advanced technology was a record? The aliens photographed people and houses with huge cameras with huge lights on them, yet a mere 30 years later we have cameras the size of pencils. The part about the high starch diets touched a nerve as far as contactees craving starch, and when he explains the alien voices that sound like records being played too fast is because of the time contiuum they are challenged with was really well thought out..this book was written in the era of hallucinatory drugs and the acid craze..could explain a lot of the hallucinations. One person saw a \\"blob\\" floating over their house, yet no other description is added. And finally, the chapter about Princess Moon Owl is where the book starts to fall apart. But hold on, if you keep reading it is all worth it, when he gets to the bridge collapse, which is brilliantly written.All I am saying is Mr. Keel admits that as a hobby he enjoys performing magic tricks and parlor games (aimed at deceiving people).You think I am here to debunk him, but I am not. One of the events described in the book actaully happened to me and I had never known there were others who experienced it as well."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This is a thorough, thought-provoking narrative of Mr. Keel's investigation in the late 1960's of a rash of UFO, &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;MIB&quot; reports in and around Pt. Pleasant, WV. The reader is presented with an almost journalistic accounting, relatively free of the bias, presupposition or fanaticism that tends to characterize this genre. Particularly impressive is the attention given to historical precedents and similar themes found throughout human myth and legend"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies opens with a mysterious event--an unusual-looking stranger knocks on a door in rural West Virginia during a storm to ask to use a phone. The couple who live in the house can't help him--and three weeks later both are victims of the Silver Bridge collapse. A visit from the devil, one of his minions, or the angel of death? No. As it turns out, it was Keel himself, stranded and looking for assistance. This first anecdote shows how easy it is for superstitious people to misinterpret an ordinary event.Most of The Mothman Prophecies consists of such anecdotes, some with explanations, many without. Many, not all, occur in the Ohio valley area centering on Point Pleasant, the focal point of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings, Point Pleasant was located on the West Virginia side of the Silver Bridge, which collapsed on December 15, 1967, due to a combination of factors, including heavy, backed-up traffic and a flawed piece of steel, the failure of which triggered the bridge's collapse.Keel cleverly builds on anecdote after anecdote. Even if some are questionable or unbelievable, they all can't be, or that seems to be his rationale. Dozens of witnesses can't be mistaken, lying, or paranoid. For the susceptible, this accumulation of horror stories makes this a frightening book. Some of those people, including Keel himself, must have seen something--from the strangely moving lights in the sky to the aerodynamically impossible \\"Mothman,\\" which doesn't flap its apparently unnecessary wings but flies straight up like a helicopter.Keel decries \\"self-style investigators\\" and believes himself to be a thorough professional. Yet his reporting, whether first- or second-hand, is full of holes. He tells of an odd stranger with \\"thyroid eyes\\" (a common feature of these sightings) who comes into a fashionable New York City watering hole but can't read the menu and doesn't know how to cut or eat a steak. He tells the waitress he's from \\"another world.\\" That is where Keel leaves the story, \\"a stranger in a strange land,\\" with some seemingly trivial but critical questions unasked and unanswered, such as: Did he understand what the check was? How did he pay? Did he know to leave a tip? If so, did he leave an appropriate one? Where did he keep his money and what condition was it in? Without answers to those questions--things that a waitress would easily remember--her assessment that he's \\"another put-on artist\\" seems most likely.He visits a farm where, coincidentally, the farmer has seen a UFO that frightened his cows off (in another anecdote, the exposed cows are found dead), burns out a piece of electrical equipment, and leaves behind a \\"fairy circle.\\" All this is so familiar to Keel that he doesn't bring in someone to perform chemical analyses to see, for example, if there is any kind of residue in the circle that would help to explain its cause. The opportunity seems to be deliberately missed.Conveniently, Keel's \\"ultra-dimensional beings\\" operate in a way that precludes independent verification of their existence. Cameras and film malfunction. Supporting witnesses are rendered unconscious or develop amnesia. While Keel believes these beings are interested in him, they contact him primarily through third parties whose reliability is questionable. When \\"Jane\\" reports that an envelope he sent was tampered with in the mail, he never considers the possibility that this woman, whose behavior is odd, is telling him what he wants to hear.The beings also control the behavior of contactees. Dozens of \\"Orientals\\" with \\"sharp features\\" (since when do Asians have \\"sharp features\\"?) and \\"thyroid eyes\\" are invited into homes for hours at a time, and their questions about personal matters are answered freely. Personally, I don't know anyone who would do this.\\"Jane\\" obligingly takes pills provided by her contacts,which make her ill and which prove to be an ordinary sulfa drug. Other people don't hesitate to climb aboard alien ships. Perhaps most telling, many of the descriptions are vague and refer to contemporary fixtures and technology. \\"Frosted glass\\" is one of the few details provided, and \\"Men in Black,\\" who are smart enough to produced unissued license plate numbers but not smart enough to obtain late-model vehicles, use the same kind of camera and clunky flash available to 1960s reporters.Keel cites a conversation with Gray Barker, who claimed not to have spoken with him on that occasion; Barker was later proven to be a hoaxer, and witnesses claimed that he did make the call while drunk. In fact, between \\"Jane's\\" assertions, Keel's stretched association of \\"A Pal\\" with \\"Apholes,\\" and his phone troubles, he seems to have become a paranoiac by the end. He even determines that the phone company is tapping his phone, but doesn't explain why.He assesses the reliability of each of his witnesses, but he is not reliable. For example, he discusses a map developed by anthropologists that shows that Indians avoided West Virginia. Keel doesn't provide a source, which makes it difficult to verify this assertion. Of course, there were Indians in West Virginia, despite his claim.The Mothman Prophecies is entertaining, and Keel tries to make the cumulative evidence compelling. The \\"facts\\" are not always accurate, the witnesses are not reliable (\\"Jane,\\" his favorite, least of all), and questions are not raised or answered.In 2007, do \\"ultra-dimensional beings\\" tap into digital phones? VOIP? Mobiles? E-mail? Instant messages? Digital cable? Have they adapted to today's technology? The anxieties that underlie The Mothman Prophecies seem to reflect those of the times--the fears surrounding the Cold War, Eisenhower's \\"military-industrial complex,\\" and big government. The Mothman Prophecies is a manifestation of the troubled times in which it was set. Today's \\"Mothman\\" or \\"Indrid Cold\\" might be very different creatures indeed.Diane Schirf15 April 2007."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"In order to comprehend the TRUE nature of All of the incidents of the paranormal (from Mothman to automatic writing) one could do no better than to read ALL of Keel's writings. UFOs are not ships from other planets (they're not &quot;false sightings&quot;, either) and big hairy monsters are not unknown biological life forms (yes, they are real and not &quot;mistaken sightings&quot;.) Keel demonstrates the nexus extant between all sectors of the paranormal -- between clairvoyants, ufos, monsters, demonic possession, possessed individuals, demons, MIBs, ghosts, and much more. As a former journalist, he knows the correct questions to ask which is mandatory in obtaining the correct answers to expose any mystery. The claims he made decades ago, which may seem impossible, are being endorsed by quantum physics today -- not that ufos or bigfeet exist but that the nature of space and time (referred to as &quot;spacetime&quot; in physics) is such that they are allowed, in the laws of nature, to exist -- quantum reality or the reality extant at, if not beneath, the subatomic level.

The ultimate question is: who, or what, exists over there and do they perceive us?"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is a great book. Even though the book isn't very organized, if you look hard enough, you gain somewhat of an understanding about the FBI, MIB (Men in Black), the mothman and other paranormal creatures. This book tells the stories of the people that live in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, who are witnesses to the Mothman and UFO's. Throughout this book John A. Keel gets off the subject and sometimes the book doesn't always make sense. But, don't let that bother you. Despite the fact that this book has no point and is plotless it is still a great book. It's a suspenseful page-turner and even leaves you questioning which stories were real and which stories weren't."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"It is worth noting that Keel wrote about Mothman just a few years before this book came out. A chapter in &quot;The Complete Guide To Mysterious Beings&quot; (1970) is devoted to the Point Pleasant phenomena. While Keel describes the various interviews he conducted with witnesses, at this point he doesn't involve himself in the story at all. He never indicates that he experienced any of these things himself. It was only later that he apparently had the idea of crafting a Mothman story with himself as the central character.Even more notable, in &quot;Mysterious Beings,&quot; Keel draws no connections between Mothman and the bridge collapse. In fact, he specifically says, &quot;It is completely erroneous to blame the collapse of the rickety old Silver Bridge on flying saucers or 'Men In Black.'&quot;This represents direct evidence (something Keel never seems to have) that we are simply not dealing with a researcher or a journalist, as Keel so often claims to be. He is a clever storyteller. Nothing more. I know the stories seem much more exciting when you think they're true, and in the middle of the night, even I get creeped out thinking about Mothman. But the story is flimsy and transparent when held up to the light of day.I loved the movie though!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel is a true investigator. He leaves no path untread upon in his search for the truth behind the UFO phenomenon. His countless accounts of the Men in Black and their games will inform you as to their place in all of this, frighten you and even make you laugh out loud. His work helps defend the theory that aliens are inter-dimensional rather than extra-terrestrial.Even if you are not a UFO buff, this is a smooth, yet thorough induction into this strange and all too close world. Even for you non-believers, the connections made in this book will at the very least gnaw at you and most definately entertain you.I've probably read over a hundred books on paranormal and UFOs and still have them. I found 'Alien Agenda' by Marrs and 'Alien Rapture by Fouche - Steiger to be my favorites, and I have read them more than once.

This story is more compelling than anything Hollywood could make up."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book was originally published by Saturday Review Press in 1975 and languished thereafter. &quot;Ufology&quot; meanwhile careened into the mad pursuit of red herrings such as Roswell, the MJ-12 documents, the John Lear hypothesis, abduction &quot;research,&quot; etc. (basically the basis of the &quot;X files&quot;) and in the process has reverted to its infancy babbling about crashed saucers, little dead aliens in Hanger 14, and aliens in underground bases (although back then they were called &quot;Deros&quot;). The disinformation boys much be laughing themselves sick, I hope their getting a percentage of the movie and TV revenue.Illuminet brought it back (along with companion volume OPERATION UFO) several years back. Apparently the message is not much more popular. To those who, like Mulder, &quot;want to believe&quot; Keel says starkly &quot;belief is the enemy.&quot; To skeptics want to disbelieve, Keel presents a deeper skepticism, not only of reality status, but of meaning. (Just because an entity exists doesn't mean it won't mess with your head.) To those self-styled &quot;responsible ufo researches&quot; who mutter about &quot;explain one unknown with another&quot; and the need for &quot;Ockham's razor&quot; Keel's attempt at explanations are no more strange than the phenomenon itself--sometimes the *only* way to explain an unknown is with another unknown. This book has something to offend just about every &quot;camp&quot; therefore only individual free thinkers can appreciate it.Choppy? Yeah, I guess. But it should be read in conjunction with TROJAN HORSE and the EIGHTH TOWER, which includes material left out of MOTHMAN.Is he lying? Maybe. But more respectable ufologist (whatever that means) like Jenny Randles in PENNINE UFO MYSTERY, Jacques Vallee in CONFRONTATIONS, and Halliday &amp; Pugh in the DYFED ENGIMA, report many of the same strange happenings (though not *all* of them at the same time and not as intensely).Finally they should consult UFO DYNAMICS by Berthold Schwarz for an even more thoroughly document work on the psychic aspects of the phenomenon.Keel speculates at times. But *nobody* has better gut hunches and when he reports his own experiences and those of others he's interviewed he's rock solid. Sometimes when he veers off into ancient astronauts like wool gathering he's weak. But in this book it's at a minimum.Truly scary.

I liked the read, I liked the movie, though they were entirely different, but aren't they all?"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book, to me, starts out a little slow, in that the author focuses solely on THE mothman and peoples' accounts with him (what he looked like, did, etc.). For about the first 100 pages the author pretty much lists interviews and 1st hand accounts with contactees and their experiences. Though, after the 100th page or so (I don't know what it is about the 100th page for me), the book gets really interesting. Things start happening personally to John Keel himself. It seems as though, the more he begins to find out, and the deeper he goes into things, the more things begin to get in his way and stop him. It becomes apparent that someone or something doesn't want him to know what he knows.. Yet he persists. A very good book which lives up to its name."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is a book by author John A. Keel which claims to tell the true story of mysterious events occurring in the eastern United States during the late 1960s. The tale is told entirely from Keel's vantage point as a first-hand investigator (and experiencer) of the paranormal happenings in question.I must say that I began reading The Mothman Prophecies with certain expectations. I had previously been exposed to the exploits of the infamous mothman by various authors in other cryptozoology texts. There was no question that this book would be the authoritative, original source material from which most other writers have since taken inspiration. I was surprised, however, at the diversity of the matter which awaited me.On the positive side, Keel is an excellent and engaging author. He writes colorfully, and offers a work that will not likely bore any of his audience. It's also nearly impossible to argue that this story isn't a \\"must read\\" for those interested in the Mothman, or any of the number of other strange incidents which Keel documents here. Having had the unique privilege of investigating and experiencing these events in person, as they were happening, the author boasts a definite authority and purity in documentation. It's obvious that The Mothman Prophecies has heavily influenced many modern researchers in various fields of the unexplained, making it an entry hard to ignore on any serious paranormalist's reading list. I must also say that, even if one were to discount its potential as a true story, the book does make a fairly good classic sci-fi page turner in its own right.Enjoyment and intrigue aside, I did develop some rather serious criticisms of The Mothman Prophecies which I feel could negatively impact some readers. As with most texts, the degree to which these cons influence your personal experience will vary.First off, Keel blatantly and repeatedly breaks one of the cardinal rules of good scientific documentation; he continuously introduces theories and opinions into his writing. The Mothman Prophecies is laced with personal interpretations of the phenomena being witnessed. In fact, something that really surprised me on several occasions, were the seamless way in which the author would offer what are essentially his beliefs as solid fact, with nary a disclaimer. It's not uncommon for paranormal investigators to attempt to draw conclusions from their works, but this goes well beyond that. Keels repeatedly debunks and downplays certain popular institutions, including UFO groups and alien visitation theories, while simultaneously replacing them with his own views. He ironically disclaims one ideology as being scientifically unsupportable, while concurrently supplanting it with his own, equally unsupported, theories. Keel regularly writes in a very matter-of-fact manner with explanations for curiosities that I do not believe have ever been accounted for scientifically, even to this day.The lack of good scientific method is also not limited to the frequent disclosure of Keel's convictions. I additionally found myself curious how someone as dedicated to investigating the paranormal as the author must have been, could still be so unprepared to gather any data other than witness statements and personal observations. Throughout the book, Keel documents a multitude of occasions where he witnessed anomalous objects and individuals, both by chance and by intent. All this time, he never mentions taking a single photograph or measurement of those in question. In one chapter, we hear how he repeatedly visits a certain hilltop at night to view a recurring colorful orb in the distance, yet he apparently never thought to take photographs, nor to simply go and wait in the location where these lights actually appeared. His lack of ability to take advantage of the seemingly ubiquitous and predictable phenomena makes the sheer legitimacy of some of the accounts suspect.Getting back to expectations, having already learned of the Mothman character from other sources, I had come into The Mothman Prophecies expecting to read an exhaustive, authoritative volume of documentation on one of my personal favorite cryptids. I was rather surprised to discover, then, that the Mothman creature really only plays a limited roll in the proceedings. This book is absolutely not the standard investigators report that one might expect to find on other monsters such as Sasquatch or Nessie. Mothman here is little more than a supporting character in a large cast of humans, weirdos, monsters, and anomalous objects. The majority of the book, particularly the latter half, is actually spent away from the Mothman, and enters into a huge variety of lights in the sky, men-in-black, UFO contactees, phone tapping, and lots of miscellaneous strangeness. In fact, Keel relates such a variety of bizarre happenings from this period in his life, that it may greatly strain ones ability to believe that the story is the least bit sane and true. The author, rather than being the normal independent observer, actually becomes the central character in what would more easily be viewed as an old school sci-fi tale, had the cover of the book not disclaimed it to be \\"based on a true events.\\"My final gripe, although smaller than the aforementioned bits, is that the writing style here has a tendency to be disjointed. Characters seem to pop up in various chapters, often for only a paragraph or two at a time. It makes remembering exactly who is where and doing what across chapters more confusing than it should be, and occasionally detracts from the ability to follow the overall story. The chapters, likewise, are somewhat hit or miss. They don't seem to follow any specific convention, some based on people, others on a block of time, and still others on a specific phenomena. The chapters themselves are also subdivided into numbered sections, in a way which at times felt arbitrary and pointless. While there are no doubt multiple ways to tell a complex and chronological story of this nature, it would have been nice had the author and editors simply picked one theme and stuck with it.Ultimately, The Mothman Prophecies is an interesting work, to say the least. If you want a good paranormal story, you certainly need to look no further. Additionally, if you're in the market for a first-hand account of the origin of the Mothman or even the other paranormal events around Point Pleasant in the late 1960s, this is really a must read. On the other hand, if you're a scientifically minded individual looking for responsible investigation of the unexplained, you're likely to be disappointed by Keel's very human (and very biased) manner of recounting events, which greatly stains belief and credibility.Rating: 3.5/5--Matt LaPlante8/3/2008"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The book is the first book I completed on the topic of UFOs and high strangeness in general. I read this book at night before going to sleep. It was hard to put down for a couple reasons - it scaried me awake so I couldn't sleep, the story was an interesting mystery, and I felt I had to finish it as soon as possible so that the uneasy feeling I had at the time would go away. With that said I still suggest people read it, since the spookiness around the world seems to be increasing. Also, the book is far superior in my opinion as compared to the movie, so I suggest the book first then the movie."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This was a very fascinating read. It does not focus only on Mothamn sightings, but all the other strange events that were supposed to have happened. If you are looking for a book that will prove Mothman exists, I don't think this is the proper book for you. It is mainly about what went on from the first sighting of Mothman to the felling of the bridge. There were a lot of strange happenings during that time. I read this as \\"I'm presenting you with the information as to what heppened as I saw it and was involved in it, and you make up your mind as to whether its true or not\\"."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I bought and reread this book that I read years ago. I still liked it. If you want a Novel or Liked the movie you might not like this book. The book isn't written that way and novel reads. you are a novel reader you may find it harder to follow and get lost by the end. It isn't a smooth read beause it's written more real life. Real life isn't a smooth read. If you want a first hand account by a investigator who was trying not to loose objectivity then you will like it. The people who might not like it are those readers who con't see a connection between UFO, Bigfoot or other strange creatures, Ghost &amp; poltergeist phenomena. You won't see the writer trying to comunticate with undead spirits or make peace with extraterestirals. You will find an investigator who noticed that ufo sights seem to corispond with poltergiest and other supernatural activity."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is not what I expected at all. I picked up the book after I saw the movie. It turns out that the movie is a fictional story based on the mothman. In this book, author John Keel tells his stories of traveling around the east cost areas and, well, UFO hunts. It is very creepy the stories he has to tell and the fact that thousands have witnessed what he is writing about. This is a very fun, and creepy book. It will leave you stirring in your sleep."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"Usually with any book I can just jump on and write up a review as soon as I'm done reading. The Mothman Prophecies was a little more in depth to do such a thing, so it's taken me a little longer. I am one of those who has read the book and not seen the movie, so hopefully I'll give you some better insight than those who saw the movie first, then read the book. I'll give this review my best shot.This is the classic \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" type book. There's maybe 1 chapter on Mothman himself. There may seem to be no plot, but from what I got from the book, the plot is that Mothman was the base of the largest UFO \\"outbreak\\" in modern history. Keel goes on to describe how weird just go weirder. You must read this with an open mind in able to enjoy it. You can't start out with an open mind, and then shut it, because it'll be no good. Wait until you're done with the book before you say its trash. Certain things towards the end will perk you up.The book isn't very well organized. I am very disappointed with this. Keel has way too many witnesses in able to be doing this, and it will screw you up at times. You may want to take gradual notes while reading just so you can go back and say, \\"Okay, now who was Jayes again?\\"Keel also admits that this book was the first time that he let some information out as to techniques used, similarities in witnesses, etc. All of these things are pretty much known today, being that the book was published in 1975.As far as \\"proof\\" goes... Nobody has proof, as far as I know, that extraterrestrials are really out there. Everyone who writes books on them are using THEIR ideas/theories. To me, John Keel has some better theories than a lot of writers out there.If you want to hear plenty of accounts with UFO's and Men in Black involved, this is the book that you want. There are more stories in this book than I can even think of right now! Be sure to pick it up. Either you'll like it or you won't.~Natalie Kilpatrick"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel, like Jacques Vallee, is one of those UFO writers who obscures as much as he enlightens. Both men have a tendency to describe unquestionably physically real occurrences (smashed objects, landing traces, radiation effects), and then to try and dismiss them as some unfathomable &quot;ultradimensional&quot; phenomenon.Still, Keel was at Point Pleasant during the 1966-67 UFO flap, of which Mothman was a part, and one doesn't have to buy his specious analyses to appreciate his simple good factual reporting. The best part of this book isn't even the reports of Mothman, but of all the other bizarre related UFO occurrences that came with him. This is one of the best books available discussing Men In Black, though typically Keel attempts to fit them into part of the &quot;ultradimensional&quot; view instead of applying Occam's Razor and calling them for what they most appear to be: government goons.In conjunction with the movie, Keel was part of an FX T.V. special returning to Point Pleasant for a followup, which is quite interesting if you ever get a chance to see it. The movie covers only about ten percent of Keel's UFO coverage in the book.In a new afterword, Keel oddly attempts to dismiss much UFO phenomena even as he is blatantly discussing it throughout his text, and for some reason calls the famous 1989 Voronezh sightings a Cold War hoax without once citing any source - I am an author in this field, keep pretty up to date, and have never once heard Voronezh even accused of being any kind of hoax. One does wish Keel would be a little less loose slinging broad, generalized accusations."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John A. Keel's The Mothman Prophecies, as a book, is just as intriguing and mysterious as the topics he is writing about. In a nutshell, the book reads as if Keel kept a loose-leaf journal about paranormal events, both reported to and experienced by him, over the course of many years, then decided to throw all of the individual pages in the air, let them land as they might, stuck a couple hundred of them in a notebook and sent them off to his publisher. There is no novel-like narrative in The Mothman Prophecies, and it's not in chronological order-instead it choppily bounces back and forth and for its entire length.The funny thing is that it works for the most part. I'm hesitant to say that the atemporally schizophrenic nature of the journal entries was an intentional, clever move on Keel's part, but it just may have been. The net effect is to mirror the inexplicability, seeming pointlessness, and skewered nature of the phenomena that Keel is talking about, but unfortunately, sometimes the attention-deficit-disorder-ladenness of the book is just aggravating. The primary thing to remember, if the book sounds interesting enough to you to tackle it (not that it's longer than your average pulp novel), is not to expect anything like a normal plot. There's an endless parade of names and events, many of which are only mentioned in one section, and it takes awhile to stop thinking that you're going to have to remember them to understand the story later. There really is no story. But once you stop waiting for a story to begin, The Mothman Prophecies should be more enjoyable to you.There are plenty of reasons you might be interested in this book. Of course, there's the surface topic-a series of paranormal events ranging from UFO's to flying \\"birdmen\\" (the Mothman) to misbehaving telephones. If you're at all a student of the paranormal, you'll want to read this. Or, you probably already have. For me, I was initially intrigued by the film and the claim that it was based on true events (although publisher Tor calls it fiction on the copyright/catalog data page). But once I started reading, I quickly forgot about the film and instead was fascinated with the realization that The Mothman Prophecies must have been one of Chris Carter's primary sources for various plots of The X-Files.If you're an X-Files fan, The Mothman Prophecies will tie the show together for you in an unprecedented way. After you read this book, the \\"mytharc\\" shows (all the alien conspiracy stuff) will no longer seem disconnected from the monster shows. And you'll frequently find yourself reminded of specific episodes correlated to specific journal entries in the book.Undoubtedly, you'll find yourself wondering at some point how much of The Mothman Prophecies is fact and how much is fiction. Tor calling the book \\"fiction\\" doesn't help towards taking it too seriously, and neither does Keel's frequent references to UFO-monger Gray Barker, who was exposed as making up at least some of the things he wrote about--see, for instance, John C. Sherwood's May/June 1998 article in Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Joe Nickell has also prepared a \\"debunking\\" of the Mothman for Skeptical Inquirer's March/April 2002 issue. I'm nothing if not a skeptic, but Nickell doesn't actually debunk much. He suggests that Mothman sightings were actually sightings of owls, and that's about all there is to his article. Keel's book, and the film that prompted Nickell's article, is about much more than can be explained by sighting an owl and mistaking it for something else.From my standpoint as a philosopher, there's something even more interesting about Keel's book. It's a wonderful example of instrumentalism. Instrumentalism, briefly, is the idea that theories about phenomena, insofar as they depart from simply recounting the phenomena in a dry manner, are interchangeable. That is, there are a multitude of possible theories for the metaphysics \\"behind\\" any observed event, and even allowing Occam's Razor (which is just a convention, not a fact, so we need not allow it-it could be misleading), any of them that accounts for the observed event is just as good as any other.Of course Keel sometimes leads us on by simple juxtaposition of easily explainable events-even going so far as implying that there could have been something paranormal about the missing minutes on the Watergate tapes-and he could be making up a sizable percentage of the anecdotes to entertain us, but that's ultimately why you should read this book anyway-for entertainment. It's also, even if fiction, a fascinating psychological artifact, and even as fiction with plenty of structural quirks, an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I just had to clarify the fact that the movie is &quot;based&quot; on the events that are recorded in Keel's book. The book is by far and away better than the movie. First off the book takes place in 1967/68 not the present. Besides giving you a look into all the paranormal phenomenon floating around Point Pleasant at the time it also gives you a look into the attitude and fear the people of the small town were feeling at the time.There are stories of aliens, strange lights, men in black, mysterious phone calls and of course the mothman. The name is misleading as he does not resemble a moth at all (in fact the name came from a reporter making a reference to a Batman villian). But to anyone interested in cryptozoology he is a beast that is worth looking into.True the book is a little egotistical as John Keel makes himself out to be a superhero at times but I genuinely enjoy his take on the situations. His writing style is a little choppy and sometimes jumps into other accounts of unexplained events but it is easy to get through.As this is really the only book that centers on the Mothman and the events in Point Pleasant it is definately reccommended reading for paranormal fans. There is even a section on Indrid Cold (another being worth looking into for the interesting and sometimes ridiculous story).Just please don't slight this chilling tale because of the terrible movie apparently made from the book's cliff notes."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"There are studied subjects and phenomenon out there that defy scientific explanation. Just because one cannot put a particular phenomenon under the rigours of scientific examination, doesn't mean such phenomenon is merely the product of a deranged mind. The reason the protectors of divine rationality are reluctant to examine the paranormal is it seems to contradict known physical laws. It doesn't follow the rules. However, if you have actually had the fortune or misfortune to experience such phenomenon i.e., spirits, UFO's, demonic creatures or source less cries of anguish in the night, ~The Mothman Prophecies~ can seem almost plausible. The book is certainly entertaining and, surprisingly, at times quite frightening.The book essentially focuses on a series of unexplained events that manifested in and around the little West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Numerous reports of Unidentified Flying Objects and strange lights in the southern skies motivated John Keel to investigate what all the fuss was about, and if there was any truth to the reports. His investigations led him down a peculiar path of events and personal experiences that finally pushed him to develop a theory, albeit an extrardinary one.What is the 'Mothman'? A journalist coined the term from the popular Batman series, because the actual creature, taken from eyewitness accounts, resembles the legendary comic hero. The amount of actual sightings is nothing less than incredible, which leads one to suspect the beast's reality. The book only touches on the Mothman and relates a scattered assortment of weird events and unusual sightings from the 'Men in Black' to 'abductions' and the cries of infants in the night. Throughout the book, Keel attempts to connect the dots, so to speak, inferring that all the varied phenomenon could well come from a single source. This is a big reach, but so is the book as a whole.Keel proposes that these manifestations, UFO's, MIB, winged-beasts et al, possibly originate from an alternate reality - another dimension if you will. These other dimensional being(s) guide and play with the human race and have been for a very long time. Throughout history these beings have manifested in many guises and forms, according to a specific historical/social context, depending on civilizations particular belief system at the time. For example, in the middle ages, this other dimensional phenomenon showed in the form of witches, warlocks, fairies and elves. For the American Indian, the phenomenon appeared as nature spirits; and in ancient times, they manifested as winged-lions, centaurs and Olympic gods. Because of our technological advancements and predilection to anything 'scientific', they now show as flying saucers, aliens and FBI agents. In other words, Keel suggests that their form shows in the way we 'interpret' these sightings - screened through our socially conditioned minds.Generally these amazing stories are told in a matter of fact tone, a journalistic style, setting the reader up from the start to lend credence to the entire book. This is clever and it works. But one gets the impression that Keel is absolutely serious about his subject matter - and to this day is trying to get to the bottom of it. This is what makes the book intriguing and worth the time."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I have read over 200 books on UFOs and for many reasons, this is my favorite. Keel is an honest investigator who was fortunate to be involved in the strange, spooky events he writes about. Taken along with his first book, Operation Trojan Horse, this slim volume says more about the true nature of the UFO phenomenon than almost any other book written since. I was initially doubtful of the validity of Keel's claims, as some other reviewers are. However, I had the luck of meeting a man mentioned in the book who accompanied Keel on his investigations. This person, whom I trust and sincerely believe to be honest, flatly stated that everything in the book was true, that he had been there, spoke to the witnesses, and eventually became involved in the phenomena, as did Keel. The fact is, these things happened. In fact, Keel left some of the strangest evidence out of the book. Mothman Prophecies is a fascinating true story, and I recommend it to anyone who has a real desire to know the truth about UFOs and the paranormal."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you want to read one book about how creepy the truly weird can become, start with this one. This book is probably the most frightening, bizarre book ever written in this field, by a reporter who was actually there when the events happened.Some of the reviewers that gave this book one star probably missed the point. The reason that Mothman, the men in black, and UFO reports are all in the book is that these are all different pieces of the same puzzle; they didn't all show up there together by coincidence. The book seems to jump around from topic to topic because all of these things were happening at the same time, and they are interrelated. Some readers probably don't see that (or don't want to), probably the same ones who saw the movie first and then decided to pick up the book, not realizing that &quot;the rest of the story&quot; is much stranger than the movie ever hinted at.The movie, which only focused on psychic effects of the Mothman sightings, left out many important aspects of the mystery (mostly so they could add a fictional love story for Richard Gere.) A friend who hadn't read the book called the movie &quot;incomplete&quot;, which is the best description I could give it too. But the book weaves all the bizarre elements together gradually as the events unfold, and they all need to be taken together to find some understanding of these phenomena. (Read Keel's classic &quot;Operation Trojan Horse&quot; for even more on solving these deep mysteries.)Sure, this book isn't &quot;All About Mothman&quot;, but that's a weak criticism. The movie wasn't about Mothman at all! At least the book has enough scary moments for a decade of Stephen King TV miniseries. That's more than enough reason to give it 5 stars, whether or not you believe in these types of phenomena. Read it before bedtime at your own risk."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I never read 5 star reviews because they usually just gush about how wonderful the book is and don't provide a balanced view. Yet here I am doing just that. But this book is perhaps the only of the many I have read on UFOs, the &quot;paranormal&quot; or the occult that truly deserves it. First and foremost, Keel is a great storyteller. He transcends the dry facts of the phenomena he investigates and weaves them into compelling human stories while, at the same time, challenges the readers to examine their own assumptions and biases about paranormal phenomena. I began reading about flying saucers and related phenomena because I thought they were silly and they appealed to the same part of me that appreciates Alfred Jarry or Marcel Duchamp. But by reading Mothman, I discovered that there are real human stories, real lives changed forever by these events that I found so silly. That reality is so much stranger and wonderous than I was willing to accept."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The fact is, these things &quot;happened&quot; - in the sense that they were reported about - and the Mothman phenomena is fairly well-documented in other places. However, this is one of the only actual published books I have managed to locate on the topic, so it deserves scrutiny. Its very apparent that something very strange was going on in West Virginia in the months leading up to the Point Pleasant bridge disaster. Taken as a more or less matter-of-fact document of the times, it works pretty well. Its almost funny how Keel describes his participation in these events, like sitting up and watching strange lights in the sky every Wednesday evening is no big deal. Keel maintains a general tone of paranoia and eerieness throughout the book, due to his rambling, but more or less matter-of-fact tone. Credibility is questionable because lot of the reconstructed conversations sound a little too contrived and detailed to be anything more than fiction or imagination (I should mention Carlos Castaneda's name at this point).Keel seems to be putting forward a very Terence McKenna-like philosophy of the goings-on, that there are invisible inter-dimensional psychic entities that are capable of influencing the world about them (except of course the part about needing heroic doses of psylocibin to see them) and they were somehow involved with what happened around Point Pleasant. But to what end? Keel seems to have opinions but he more or less keeps them to himself, or allowed his publisher to purge them. The book has been too chopped up and filtered to be anything more than kitsch. Its still a fascinating read and recommended for fans of the paranormal."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES can stand simply as a &quot;stranger than science&quot; potboiler, but it's much more than that. Keel is recognized as one of the few &quot;serious&quot; researchers into the paranormal, and the power of his insights into this vexing subject shows in the fact that his ideas are quoted and seconded by no less a UFO authority than Dr. Jacques Vallee. The &quot;high strangeness&quot; nature of what is described in the book morphs easily into what is generally perceived as &quot;pure kookiness&quot; -- but the strength of the book lies in the way that line between belief and disbelief and truth and fiction is pushed further and further, with a good deal of shivers and goosebumps building up along the way. Bottom line: The book's utterly unique, and worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I was both amused and entertained! Yet there is an air of realism to this book that really gets to you. When you are finished reading this book, even being the grandest sceptic... The only thing that left me slightly short was the fact we are not informed of where these paranormals originate. But that is not important as the story is super written and not a weak spot in it. I say absolutely yes, get it.If you enjoyed this another book which states all these events(including the Roswell crash) are actually from our future in a very good book, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"An interesting and fascinating report on paranormal events that took place in small town West Virginia in 1966/67. The author records the events as he experiences them or they are reported to him by others. The reports are many. These are mostly regarding a huge winged figure that many people witnessed and who supposedly terrorized the residents of the area for an entire year. The most fascinating and unnerving part of the book is it's reports of all the &quot;men in black&quot; contacts and ufo incidents. It has been many years since these events and therefore this book was probably quite scary when it was first published, but has lost some of the impact in our desensitized society. The book falters though when the author suggests that ufo experiences in general are a mass hallucination of somekind, which at this point in time is more ridiculous than just admitting their existence. The writing style is rather lacking, but not so noticed due to the content. The book might turn off someone who realizes that the author's ego is of more focus than the information he is reporting."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The little content contained is interesting.However, the entire book is short chapters of journal notes with the occasional splash of commentary thrown in.Badly written, poorly organized.He could have at least organized it chronologically.The constant way of making himself out to besome sort of superhero got very annoying very quickly."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled \\"John Keel explains how the universe really works\\". For every \\"Mothman\\" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's \\"research\\" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the \\"Mothman\\" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences.

I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I found this book very interesting. I felt it covered the actual happenings in a factual manner without making it boring.The author also did not seem to discount the fact that there could be more here than meets the eye.

At times the reader would like to read more about a particular case history--more detail--more follow-up. The lack of this information may lead the reader to feel shortchanged. On the other hand the excessive number of people having encounters lends to the credibility of the book, especially so with the witnesses in Point Pleasant, West Virginia where the mothman is first seen on November 15, 1967. The book's climatic end is expected with the diaster on December 15, 1968.John Keel's &quot;Mothman&quot; is undoubtably a classic, not only for ufologists but for mainstream readers as well, more particularly now that the release of the &quot;Mothman movie is imminent.P L Brown"},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"I thought this book was very informative to the reader. It's the first book that I have read about 'mothman' or ufos and now I am more interested in the phenomena. The content of this book is good, but I think that it could have been organized a little better. It would have helped if the author told the story in chronological order. There is not much dialog, but if you enjoy reading a book filled with desccription, then this book would probably appeal to you. Do not expect the book to be just like the movie because it's not, it goes more into detail.

You will learn next to nothing about what was going on in Point Pleasant, and why the bridge collapsed.This book is largely an unorganized, haphazard semi-autobiograhpical collection of anecdotes that appear to be meaningful to the author, most of them about flying saucers and men in black and the author's problems with his phone bill. The &quot;narrative&quot; skips around in time and place and subject. Keel devotes more pages to some odd people in the Long Island ufo community than he does to writing about the bridge. He has two sentences about why the bridge might have collapsed. There are no photos, maps, figures, or appendices in this book. Unless you get a map of the Point Plesant area, you have no idea where the events he describes takes place. There are about 10 footnotes, and they document trivial, dumb stuff.Keel must be laughing about selling the title of this book to the movie company. Even though the movie wasn't all that good, it was far better than this book.It's not so much I regret spending the money on this book, but I feel very foolish about having wasted two hours reading it."},{"Title":"The Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" follows a usual form for ufology books: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious \\"sightings\\". This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\"Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest.

Drucker has produced an important book -- one which, like most such books, a difficult read. Intended as a companion to \\"The End of Economic Man: The Origins of Totalitarianism,\\" it arguably does a better job of explaining those origins, tracing them to the Enlightenment-era enthronment of human reason as a perfect vehicle for discerning the social good -- a belief which admits no possibility of freedom and therefore must necessarily lead to despotism. The genius of the American revolution, he argues, is its rejection of this belief in favor of the explicitly Judeo-Christian epistemological worldview according to which man is imperfect and requires freedom in order to decide between competing conceptions of the good. It is that conservative, anti-Enlightenment principle, he argues, which must be extrapolated to the present day in order to integrate industry into society.Drucker's prose is heavy and peppered with references to historical events, personalities, and institutions that would be obscure to modern readers. This is a book to read and digest slowly -- all the more so if your intellectual grounding in history and philosophy is shallow. But it should not be passed up merely because of its difficulty, for the problems which Drucker identifies are recurrent throughout history and still exist, in some form, today. And the consequences of leaving those problems unaddressed -- the growth of an unaccountable, uncontrollable government bureaucracy which threatens responsible self-government and basic freedoms -- are chillingly also evident in the creeping nanny-statism of vast swaths of Europe and even some American cities."},{"Title":"The Future of Industrial Man","review":"I encountered with this page while trying to order English version of The future of industrial man, which Japanese version I just finished.This book is one of the most exciting writing by P.Drucker.I achieved or rather confirmed, the basic platform of the socio-econmy we live in. I have learned that the value or discipline of the economy and society of developed nations is not based on the surrealistic ideas but on the accountable prosess of the hsitory.That being said, the progress of present economy of each nation should have its reference in the world history as well as in its own.Peter F. Drucker would not want to be an icon. But, he is so charming!"},{"Title":"The Complete Beginner's Guide to Genealogy, the Internet, and Your Genealogy Computer Program","review":"The title of this book is a bit deceptive.

In the course their 6 month adventure, Gerald and his wife, Jacquie, must deal with numerous non-animal problems, such a revolution in Argentina, a crazed carpenter cage builder, and the eccentric habits of their temporary housekeeper, who also happens to be the local madam.

Mr. Cartwright has tapped into it and it flows well in his book. Several of the musicians are on YouTube and listening and watching them really made the book pop and come alive.

Just what I needed!"},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"I am a big fan of Mothering Against The Odds, and anyone undaunted by the stellar line up of scholars, academicians and therapists - mothers all - will be richly rewarded. I was worried that this would be an academic workout of a read, but was drawn from page to page, spellbound by the stories of mothers, each searching for her truth and resisting further marginalization in doing so. The book feels like a conversation among friends in a way that includes the reader as a mother resistor, empowering her with the light of truth telling and consoling each of us not only with the sameness and horror of our collective shadows, but the power to resist more marginalization. This is a perfect Mother's Day or any day present for every mother in all of our lives. It was a real gift to me, both elevating the conversations with mother friends held out of the coach's or teacher's or doctor's auditory range and validating them, as well as welcoming me into a thoughtful group of mothers, adding a new layer of oomph to my own resistance. There were many chapters I approached with the expectation that I would be a reader experiencing an &quot;other,&quot; and instead I was moved by a deep seeded commonality. Knowing what I know about real dialogue with pediatricians, (all of my children's, but especially my son's) coaches, school administrators, teachers, (especially the teachers of my adolescent children) - even as a privileged mother in a conventional heterosexual family, I feel more sameness than difference with the &quot;special&quot; categories of mothers in each chapter of your volume. All mothers do experience marginalization, a relegation to the sidelines of our growing children's lives with the concomitant shame undermining our pride when loving involvement persists. A careful reading of this volume also invokes shame that comes with significant enlightenment for any way that I may have contributed to shoving &quot;other&quot; mothers into the shadows. With the wisdom of this volume, I can see myself as a confident mother resistor and truth teller and not simply the persistent nuisance I fear some of my children's teachers and many of their friends' parents perceive me to be. Each chapter carries a strong message for each of us, not for &quot;others.&quot; I am empowered by the bravery of teen mothers resisting the mold with which their welfare workers try to choke them. As a consummate letter writer, many of them unsent, I am empowered by Dr. Cynthia Garcia Coll and her colleagues' account of an incarcerated letter writing mother who stayed connected with her child and her own truth in writing letters that likely never reached him. I am emboldened by Miriam Greenspan's conviction born of many mothers' experience: &quot;ours is...an emotion phobic culture,&quot; as I recall the pathologizing of my emotionally attuned children by well intentioned teachers when my children's' fears and sensibilities did not mesh with convention. I am liberated by Dr. Janet Surrey and her colleagues' careful unfolding of the adoptive experience and the enlivening picture of adoption &quot;as much a recovery from loss as it is loss itself.&quot; I love the conviction presented as part of Dr. Laura Benkov's description of families headed by lesbians and gay men, but also as a truth woven throughout the volume, that &quot;it is the quality of our relationships rather than the structure of our families that matters most in human development.&quot; And the most chilling truth of all, from Dr. Phoebe Kazdin Schnitzer, apropos single mothers, but easily applied to the actual story of any mother, and in fact, the shadow side of this volume: &quot;This is marginalization up close - moving from stereotypes to inhibited interactions.&quot; And when each of us settles down and recalls the ways in which our mothering life has been constricted by cultural norms, or when each of us joins in our own rich conversations with other mothers or the rich conversational markers throughout the volume, it is a dark reality that confronts us, both more and less frightening because it is a shared one."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"I was pleased when I encountered Mothering Against the Odds as I was selecting course books for my undergraduate class. And, my pleasure increased when I realized how stimulated my students were with reading and discussing it. They could see in a new way the full meaning of marginalization and resistance through the development of the &quot;liberatory voice.&quot; The authors' lucid definition of marginalization and the sociopolitical act of resistance served as a guiding analytical principle for the reading and discussion about women's lives as mothers. The diversity presented was eye-opening. The new ways in which the students could encounter their own mothers was quite moving. The opportunity this reading gave these women to voice their recognition of margenalization in their own lives and their desire to engage in the social task of re-valuing motherhood and acts of mothering was unique. After this successful academic experience, I featured Mothering Against the Odds as a Book of the Month on the Wise Woman Productions website. In response several of our members requested a discussion group to consider the many provocative issues raised by the book."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"This is a stunning volume of maternal voices that are usually ignored. We hear from poor mothers, mothers of color, homeless and incarcerated mothers, single, lesbian, adoptive and teen mothers. These mothers, taken together are the true face of American motherhood. I really love this book."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"The lives of the women we meet in Mothering Against the Odds provide the reader with a new awareness of the complexities of child-rearing in the United States today. The editors of this volume, clinicians, researchers, educators, theoreticians and writers, were initially drawn together by their common interest in establishing a community where they could share their experiences in parenting. Their own sense of personal and intellectual isolation as mothers spurred them to examine the multiplicity of mother-roles faced by all women; the resulting volume is the work of eighteen writers and scholars. Garcia Coll, et al frame their discussion of mothering in a format of personal narratives which reveal the individual challenges faced by those who mother at the so-called margins of society. The editors' choice of these narratives of women mothering came from their awareness that the diverse experiences shaping mothers' experiences are untreated in contemporary discussion of society's problems. The chapters illustrate a variety of mothering experiences: stories of women with biracial and exceptional children, mothers with HIV/AIDS; immigrant, homeless, single, adoptive, incarcerated, and teen mothers. Three conversations with the editors are interspersed within the text which highlight themes emerging from the individual stories of mothering. Each chapter stands alone as moving account of a mother's struggles and triumphs in a particular instance; all the chapters are tied together by the common thread of the voice of the mother's experience in each instance. The reader is left with a sense of the formidable tasks faced by those who are so often invisible in our society and yet who are coping and contributing successfully in many ways that leave one humbled. The voices of these mothers are the voices and lives that sociologists, psychologists, and of course educational policy makers, need to consider as they pursue ways to improve the lives of our children and of our families. While this is an academic book it also is a highly accessible and readable book for all those who have an interest in children, women and families. Above all, the stories told here represent lives of triumph, lives of women quietly confronting many problems usually hidden from the public view. And the editors state their intent to continue their study of mothering and the varied contexts women live in; we certainly hope they will. While the reader is left with many troubling questions, we also hope that through a consideration of the dignity of the lives of these women we can bring about change. Mothering Against the Odds is a must read for all those concerned with issues related to families today."},{"Title":"The Disaster Lobby: Prophets of Ecological Doom and Other Absurdities","review":"The authors (Thomas Shepard as well as Melvin Grayson) take on a number of &quot;liberal&quot; causes, especially environmentalism and consumer advocacy.

Each chapter tells what happened to her at some point in her life, and the events are so universal that ANY one could relate to them.

The stories are wonderful, and the insights are right on. The author takes a word and then makes a picture out of it, truly awesome. Once you start this book, you will not want to put it down, so sit back, relax, and enjoy an afternoon or evening in the presence of the Lord. Believe me, it will be time well spent.Don't forget to pick up a copy of her other book: &quot;Dancing Around the Throne&quot; it is worth the effort and a whole lot more."},{"Title":"At San Jose Make a Left: Spiritual Insights by Someone Who Has Been There...and Done That!","review":"This book gripped my attention and would not let go! It was like everytime I picked it up to read a story, it was exactly what I needed. The whole chapter was a delight, with the story at the beginning, a wonderful insight following with Bible verses to back up what the author said, then a unique drawing to finish the whole. Her 'word pictures' are awesome! They alone are worth the price of the book. The author has her hand on the pulse of the nation, and when she speaks, you know she understands and is knowledgeable about the subject. Her insights just hit you where you live and will delight and astound you. Wake you up and make you smell the coffee! Each chapter is independent of the others, but they bind together to make a whole picture of a live dedicated to others and in tune with God. This book is for everyone, bar none."},{"Title":"Afternoon of an Author: A Selection of Uncollected Stories and Essays","review":"Even though this title appears to be out-of-print, I highly recommend taking Amazon's offer to track one down for you. It is by far Fitzgerald's best collection of shorter work, ranging from his younger Bazil stories to his more mature &quot;semi-Hollywood&quot; work.

We ended up going without her, but my daughter loves reading this book. She was too young then for me to read word by word so I simplified it a bit and sang some songs with the story (songs about train, the bus and the donkey). She learned about cats, the painter, the Eiffel tower, the \\"Un fort\\", the church, etc. She loves Mona Lisa and knows that Mona Lisa \\"lives\\" in the Louvre. She often asks about Mona Lisa and gets really excited knowing that the page is coming up.The funny this was that she all a sudden blurted out \\"Eiffel Tower\\" during our trip to CA. She saw the electric tower that looked a little bit like Eiffel and thought that was it! I think she needs a Paris trip in the future so she can see the REAL Eiffel tower;)"},{"Title":"This is Paris","review":"I admit, I didn't look at the size when I ordered the book. When it arrived, I was pleased to see it was a nice tall hardcover book in excellent condition, even though I bought it used. This book is not a story, this is an educational book. My daughter is infatuated with Paris, and although she's 11 (note: below grade level reading, preteen mind) she wanted this book. She loves it. It's an easy way for her to remember places in Paris without it being textbooky. It's great for younger kids too of course! It has very nice drawings and brief passages about famous places and common sites of Paris. A nice touch in the later editions is that the editor has put \\"updates\\" to information such as: police are no longer on bicycles, but are on motorbikes, markets have moved, and other tidbits of change. If you buy educational books to read to your young children, I'd recommend this one as a nice introduction to the places in Paris. That, and Google Earth (ha ha)."},{"Title":"This is Paris","review":"Definitely outdated, though it was nice to see how things were in Paris several decades ago.

The story introduces children (ideally from ages of about 3 - 7) to the magic of Paris. The book evokes a sense of wonder, while relaying facts about Paris that children will find very captivating. We see things like Notre Dame, a ticket to ride the Metro, and a gendarme. The illustrations are just lovely, done in a style that helps provide a leaping off point for imagining even more about the story. A marvel of brilliance masquerading as simplicity! The book has been in print for nearly 50 years, and deserves it place along with other children's classics of the city like \\"Make Way for Ducklings.\\""},{"Title":"This is Paris","review":"A beautiful reprint of this classic.

Although Rod speaks with a modern voice, his is still the voice of all gentle souls who have spoken, sung and who even now speak the language of poetry. But it isn't simply a language, it is a way of seeing most are too rough and immature or too busy to slow down enough to understand or even attempt themselves. \\"Listen to the Warm\\" is a great entry into Rod McKuen's heart, but continue to the other works that read very much like a travelogue through the course of his sensitive and wonder-filled life. If we all could but love as genuinely and deeply and hungrily as such hearts."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"\\"Listen to the Warm\\" leaves you feeling warm and safe and understood, and wanting to feel the noise and see the cold, too. Rod is a loner. So, if you are a loner or having one of those days where you wished you were alone on a deserted island, this would be the book to read. He uses lots of rhyme which keeps your attention but then sometimes not. He is in New York City with a cat on one page and then in France somewhere with someone.Rod McKuen is criticised for not being a heady prose writer like the great poets of our time. But, if you want to read the softly spoken words of a worldly man, an author and composer of classical music, who can express his feelings about every inch of his life,\\"Listen to the Warm\\" is a must read.

Rod McKuen could use simple words to describe a raft of emotions and feelings."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"This book was in everywhere in the early 1970s -- in bookstore window and given as gifts to friends -- so it's difficult to believe it's not even in print today. Rod McKuen was a romantic, &quot;touchy-feely&quot; poet; he was someone you read in your early 20s and outgrew when the time came to buckle down to the more workday world of job and family. That said, these poems are not all puerile -- you can find some good lines in them if you look hard enough. &quot;Warm&quot; has decidedly grown cold, but it's time for a revival. I'd give him -- not only this book but his numerous others that appeared around the same few years -- a 4 for the mix: better than average, but if you're looking for poetry that sticks to your ribs a little longer, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"Like many adolescents in the late 1960s, I had a copy of this book, along with my Whole Earth Catalogue and my Jimi Hendrix albums. But try as I might, I always wondered why reading Rod McKuen did nothing for me. I feared it was because I didn't like poetry. Fortunately, I came to recognize that, for me, his work had a kind of faux-profundity and superficial artistry, more like cheap self-help books, and nothing even close to the true poets of those times: \\"Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind, down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves, the haunted frighted trees, out to the windy beach, far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.\\" (Dylan)If McKuen makes you think that you might actually like poetry, then his work has value. But only if you continue on to the truer poets-- the ones that actually do think deeply and offer a rich, creative take on life, love, and the human condition. If Shakespeare and Wordsworth are too much, and Shelly and Keats too difficult, then start with Robert Frost, or Emily Dickinson, or more contemporary poets like Billy Collins or Rita Dove. Move into their worlds and McKuen will become a distant memory.So please, if you like Rod McKuen, do not stop there-- his is just a flimsy doorway to a wider and more magnificent world of moving images, powerful ideas, and startling creativity.

My girlfriend kept an old copy of &quot;Sloopy&quot; stashed in the glove box. I almost crashed her sedan as she read aloud the first lines of &quot;Sloopy&quot;.McKuen's writing style, a strange combination of self love and bombast, mixed with bad grammar and awkward metaphors, will ever serve young poets as an example of how not to write free verse. I always chuckle when I hear the line &quot;my arms full of canned liver and love.&quot; You say potato, and I'll say poetaster. Let's call the whole thing off."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"I have a Rod McKuen record collection, which I file under &quot;comedy.&quot; He follows a standard formula in his books and records: a pathetic picture of himself alone on the cover, and dozens of dreary poems in the most juvenile and embarassing language about his &quot;looking for a friend&quot; or &quot;not getting love.&quot; His miserable string arrangements and inappropriate matching of upbeat songs with suicidal lyrics, and vice versa, makes him the unforgettable king of schlock.But let's keep Rod's memory alive tongue-in-cheek, the only way possible.Rod: get help! (From his website I understand he's now on Prozac. Thank God.) I've seen high schoolers' &quot;I'm different&quot; poetry that was better written. My all-time favorite is &quot;Sloopy,&quot; an overblown dirge about a cat that leaves. Yes, Rod, your neighbors did think you were crazy prancing around in the snow calling her name. But they were also impressed at how much money you were making selling this garbage straight into the mainstream.Next: Rod, &quot;warm&quot; is an adjective. &quot;Warmth&quot; is a noun. You cannot just mix up parts of speech and call it poetry -- especially in every other poem. And the Sloopy line about walking dogs in the snow so often &quot;they left little pink tracks.&quot; I've never seen this: if anything, people are reluctant to walk their dogs in the snow, and certainly not on a forced march.If we take this &quot;poet&quot; seriously, we do damage to the whole field of poetry, and the thousands of poets who CAN'T sell their work, and aren't millionaires mining the vein of &quot;loner.&quot;On an aside: there's one song somewhere in which Rod McKuen teams up with Herb Alpert. I tried to picture the scene: Herb shows up in the Tijuana Taxi, and Rod painfully tells him to leave the mariachi bass (guitaron) in the trunk.Geez, folks, get out there and learn your poetry and live your lives. Rod is the king of cheese, not to be taken internally! I think the complete lack of mixed reviews listed here shows how seriously he is taken by real readers of books."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"One of McKuen's strong points has always been his ability to express in simple words what all of us have probably encounted at one time or another; love and sorrow. He has the ability to say what all of have wanted to say, express in human terms the emotions all of us have experienced. He may not use the heady prose of the great writers, but there is hardly a person alive who can read this book and not say, &quot;Been there, felt that&quot;."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"I owned this book for several years and somehow lost it between college and marriage.

Love, the loss of the one you love-being alone, feeling alone, doing things because they are you but not because they are right. I highly recommend this book-I read the whole thing every week."},{"Title":"Listen to the Warm [Hardcover]","review":"I first became familiar with Rod McKuen's poetry in the late 1960s. I was digging through my books the other evening and out popped this small volume which my wife and I purchased soon after its publication. It has been a lot of years since I read this little book, and the offerings of the author. I remember I enjoyed many of his poems when I was much, much younger. Being a life long reader of poetry, and writer of bad poetry, I thought I would give this one a read and see if my feelings and taste have changed over the years, as they have in so many other areas.Now my definition of good poetry is quite likely different than some. It is certainly not an academics view of this art form, nor is it an opinion from someone who has never read a poem or a work of poetry in their lives. I view good poetry as that which moves the reader in some fashion. It can be delight, sadness, anger, dread, depression, happiness or any other emotion or feeling you might want to come up with. If it moves you, it is good. Conversely, if you receive no emotional kick out of it, then it is probably bad. The thing is, it all depends upon the individual reading it. I discuss poetry a lot with friends and family. Some like one poet, others like another, and some could care less. As an example, I absolutely despise the work of Allen Ginsberg and in particular his work Howl; dose that make this work \\"bad poetry?\\" It certainly does not. Many of my friends love this work and I certainly would not force my tastes and thoughts upon them. His work moves them. For them, Howl is a great work. My dislike for this poem and this poet only makes it a poet or a poem that this particular reviewer dislikes; it does not make it \\"bad.\\" The same holds true for ever poet, musician, writer and artist who ever made their mark.Can I compare McKune to Lord Alfred Tennyson, Poe, Longfellow, Hood, Emerson, Keats, or a plethora of others? Of course not. I would not even attempt such a thing. On the other hand, can I say that McKune's work has not touched me as much as some of these poets? Cannot say that either. It has indeed done so at times. Yes, Rod McKuens style is simple, at times it can be a bit cloying and he certainly makes plenty of errors with his grammar. If a particular work of his touches you though, do you really care? If, after reading his work, you cannot stand it, no one will hold a gun to your head and force you to read more..anyway, I hope they won't.I enjoy this poets simple, heartfelt thought or thoughts. I like his easy style. I like the fact that you do not need a twelve hundred page dictionary and an advanced degree in Middle English or Norse History to set down and read him for the pure joy. Simple is sometimes best. Now I am not the most sophisticated individual in the world... that is for sure. While I have read literally thousands of works of poetry in my life, which has been relatively long, I am certainly no expert, nor have I had an academic background in poetry, other than most folks get while struggling through college...it certainly never was on my radar when declaring a major. Does that make me any less able to enjoy any particular work? I don't think so.Rod McKuen is a good poet if his work moves you in anyway, and this is a wonderful little volume of his work and I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Diodorus Of Sicily (diodorus Siculus), Volume I","review":"Diodorus Siculus is referred to by so many historical authors, I thought I'd read the man myself.

I recognize that this is partially my own fault -- I should have checked the copyright date and did a bit more research prior to heading out there, but I would recommend that, if you use this book, you also get an actual, updated, trail map of the park and rely on that map rather than the book to find your way.

But I was disappointed by the quality of the writing and the story. The book is thicker and the story is longer and more confusing than in his first two books. What Heywood really, really needed for this book was a ruthless editor.The story line is terribly convoluted, with many happenings that simply didn't make sense to me, and various strands which were not brought together at the end. Through much of the story I really didn't know where we were in the mystery; I couldn't keep track of all that was going on. And there were too many other happenings in a warden's life that were distracting from the main story. I never could figure out what Trapper Jet had to do with the story. And there wasn't much writing about being in the woods, about woods skills and real natural resources information as he did in the first two books. One part I liked was chapter 37 about Service's visit to the Ojibway elder Santinaw; that took us back into the brush.Nor could I understand why, if Siquin Soong's White Moon Trading Co. was subject to a federal investigation for drug trafficking and smuggling, Grady Service or Maridly Nantz wouldn't have warned the Michigan Governor candidate Lorelei Timms, who counted Soong as a major supporter. My God, if a major supporter were the center of a federal investigation, wouldn't I want to know that?And finally, the book seemed somewhat more coarse with respect to sexual exploits, with people hopping in and out of bed with each other. This wasn't integral to the story, but it appeared to be more prominent than in the first two books. Overall, his latest work just plain needed some ruthless editing."},{"Title":"Chasing A Blond Moon: A Woods Cop Mystery","review":"I am a huge Heywood fan and was excited about the latest Woods Cop mystery. However, I was very disappointed with this novel. As others have mentioned there was a lot in the book that simply did not make sense. Also, it was hard to follow the plot since Heywood insisted in bringing in a cast of thousands who added very little to the story. Also, the ending was not satisfactory. It was as if the plot was not moving along but the page count was too high so Heywood used a Deus ex machina to end the story, still with little conclusion."},{"Title":"Chasing A Blond Moon: A Woods Cop Mystery","review":"The main plot in the novel is about bear hunting in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, but the novel digresses into a multitude of side plots and relationships including some descriptive sex. Grady Service also discovers that he has a 16 year old son whom he had been unaware of.The novel develops a case of people killing bears to obtain their gall bladders for sale in Asia (a real problem in parts of the US). Various spear carriers are killed or captured along the way, but the case is not really resolved as the person behind it (the buyer) is never positively identified, and their is no final resolution, even thouth there have been several murders, and a large amount of money is unaccounted for.While the action in the side cases is interesting, it perhaps is a little too much in a short time period, and it does not really offset the failure to completely resolve the main case. It is somewhat like Perils of Pauline, with unresolved issues to carry into the next episode.The novel has sex, violence, and language. I would rate it somewhere between PG-13 and R. Besides the criminal activity, there are people sleeping around. Side issues range from date rape to murder, and Service sticks his nose into a lot of things outside his jurisdiction."},{"Title":"Chasing A Blond Moon: A Woods Cop Mystery","review":"I have just finished reading this novel (and now need to start getting some work done!) and throughly enjoyed it.

Hunting and fishing are of no interest to me but I am interested in the lives of the men and women who protect the animals AND hunt and fish. The book is well written. I find I am getting a different point of view--maybe not one with which I am comfortable. Grady seems a good guy with a good heart. Have read the other reviews that complain about Grady's love interests and \\"all the sex\\". Really? Seems to me this group in particular would have a very \\"natural\\" sense of sex. Since I am interested in what motivates Grady watching him react to his son and Maridy is very enlightening. We do not live in a vacuum. If you want to read about fly fishing and bear hunting may I refer you to Field and Stream. My Dad was of the WWII generation and was reared in Western Pennsylvania. I watched him fly fish and tie his own lures from the time I was a baby. I have never been to Michigan and can't say I ever wanted to but got to say I would like to experience the \\"yooper culture\\". Thank you Joseph Heywood for bringing this wonderful community to life for me. (OH--And keep going with the romance and parenthood---I think it makes Grady so interesting.)"},{"Title":"Chasing A Blond Moon: A Woods Cop Mystery","review":"Good book!!

These books usually assume you understand, at the minimum, the symbol for salt or the math equation to measure an area. For this book, it would help if you are familiar with the main phases of representational styles in art. For this is not a picture book, but rather reading material with explanatory pictures on the psychology of perception.But, Dr. Gombrich wrote for the general public and nobody does it better. Having read all his books more than once, he takes you by the hand, leads you down his primrose path, and entices you by way of his poetic language; much like walking in a garden with a gardener. You may not know all the plant's latin names, but the experience is rewarding."},{"Title":"Art and illusion;: A study in the psychology of pictorial representation (Bollingen series)","review":"In this now classic work, Gombrich uses his command of the history of art to reflect deeply on how creators and viewers of illusionistic, that is representational art, do what they do. While he wrote this in the 50's, and is deficient when it comes to issues of abstract art (which is really outside his stated purview) he comes close to what might now be termed a post-structuralist view of seeing, certainly an extremely careful and sophisticated one. Old-fashiioned as some of the language is, the book remains fresh and well worth reading or re-reading. The numerous and very well-chosen illustrations are unusually well coordinated in their placement, so that the reader rarely is forced to lose her place while thumbing back and forth in search of them."},{"Title":"Art and illusion;: A study in the psychology of pictorial representation (Bollingen series)","review":"Art & Illusion is an altogether brilliant text - one of the most profound discussions of fine art in the 20th century.

I notice that another reviewer complained about the pictures in his copy being too light, so it seems to have been a quality control issue.That having been said, this is a scholarly and readable text, even humorous in places. The style is beginning to show age, but the writing is always clear, concise and comprehensible, and the book is truly INTERESTING, for anyone who cares about art. There is a wealth of well-selected illustrations, a few in colour (these were reproduced quite well).

Now in my 50's, I decided to Google this sentence and found that it is from the writings of a Medieval English priest John Mirk (flourished 1390-c. 1414) who wrote advice to parish priests. And in the original, it was not \\"child\\" but \\"maiden\\"-sexism at its root origin! So the time-line of when I could be heard from again was never, for, in Mirk's world, once a maid married then her tongue could only agree with her husband-never to have a voice of her own.I sing the praises of Google.

Prichard Jr.","review":"Who would of thought that here in the third millennium we would still take time to read about Ed Prichard, whose life story will be linked through eternity with a third rate felony-and a blundering, ham-handed felony at that? Prichard is dead more than 20 years now, as are almost all those who loved and hated him. He never held public office-indeed, more generally, never came close to fulfilling the promise of his admirers. Why would anyone care?To this question, it is possible to give an uncharitable reply. Kentucky, one might say, is a place with more past than future. To dwell on a footnote may be read as saying: we almost amounted to something, we could have been a contender.And yet, and yet. And yet we have the testimony of the best and the brightest that Prich himself was the best and the brightest; if not as an actor, perhaps as a thinker and certainly as a talker.. Indeed, I had the privilege to observe Prich in what might be called his rehabilitation phase: the early 60s when his friends were trying to ease him back from obloquy and exile onto the political stage. I will add my testimony to those of legions who swore that Prichard in full spate was simply the greatest three-ring oratorical circus of which a simple country boy might dream, his whooshes of insight keeping easy company with his flashes of savage wit. No wonder he won the affection of Felix Frankfurter, of Phil Graham, of-good heavens, is this true?-of Sir Isaiah Berlin.Indeed: Berlin was once his roommate and like so many was stunned and horrified when Prich was convicted by a Kentucky jury The details are there Tracy Campbell's account, along with a great deal else one may have remembered or forgotten about the politics of Kentucky in the last Century. Campbell tells it all earnestly and unflinchingly, and a strangely compelling story it remains.Is there a larger context for Prich's story? Probably not a great one, but by a stretch, you could fit it into more general story of the history of the New Deal. It was here, after all, that Prich occupied center stage: as the brilliant young scamp who enchanted Felix Frankfurter, and who put himself at the elbow of Robert Jackson, of Fred Vinson, of Jimmie Byrnes (although both Jackson and Byrnes stayed aloof, and even Vinson saw Prich's limits). One can, at least with caution, take Prich as a kind of symbol for what was right and wrong with those years: the brilliance, the optimism, the energy, together with an overlarge dose of self-admiration, bordering on downright narcissism. Prich was, after all, as dazzling as they say he was. But he was an appalling abuser of friendship, a serial shirker of duties, and at best no more than a mediocre husband and father. Even after he started taking fees from the strip miners, he never really paid his taxes. Indeed, one of the remarkable parts of the Prich story is the way so many people were taken in by him-not merely by his skills at rhetoric and dialectic (which were indisputable) but by the notion that these virtues somehow translated into political gravitas.Campbell does a conscientious job of surveying the evidence surrounding Prichard's pivotal bout with ballot-stuffing in 1948. Laudably, he hesitates to draw any grand conclusions. I will indulge myself a bit more. Prich came back to Kentucky touted as the next governor, senator, president-offices to which (says Campbell), absent his \\"lapse\\" he \\"would certainly\\" have risen. But by Campell's own testimony, this is nonsense. Campbell himself says that Prich \\"had not the ambition or the personality for such posts.\\" Quite right: probably nobody knew this better than Prich himself. His friends saw him as the next Roosevelt; he knew he was closer to Peter Pan. By sticking his hand in a ballot box, he relieved himself of all these impositions: he may have left his friends bewildered and disappointed, but he gave himself the freedom to remain forever young."},{"Title":"Short of the Glory: The Fall and Redemption of Edward F. Prichard Jr.","review":"In this accessible, informative biography, Campbell presents the tragic story of one of the brightest stars on the 20th century American political scene. A man of acknowledged genius, fragile ego, and an almost childlike attitude, Prichard was seen by many as the most gifted and promising of the new generation of liberal politicians that arose out of the New Deal. Though his hopes for political office were ended by J. Edgar Hoover's irrational vendetta against him, Campbell makes it clear that the person who ultimately brought about Prichard's downfall was Prichard himself. This is an excellent book about the lofty heights and tragic depths that a man could sink to, and I highly recommend it to any history buff or political wonk."},{"Title":"Short of the Glory: The Fall and Redemption of Edward F. Prichard Jr.","review":"If you enjoy real stories about real people with all their human faults, you will enjoy this book written about a real man and and his experiences in the political world. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of humans that all of us can relate to. Perseverance is the name of the game in this book, as well as the art of manipulating people for personal gain. Illegitimata non tatum carborundum really shines through. It is difficult to put down once started."},{"Title":"Short of the Glory: The Fall and Redemption of Edward F. Prichard Jr.","review":"Ed Prichard was called &quot;the brightest of our generation&quot; by no less than Katherine Graham. He was Felix Frankfurer's first law clerk, and served ably and brilliantly in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.Then came 1948. In Texas, Lyndon Johnson won a Senatorial election, as the saying goes, by the votes of 49 dead Mexicans. That same year, Prichard helped stuff ballot boxes in his home county, Bourbon County, Kentucky, for a forgettable Senate candidate who had the election locked up anyway. But, hounded by J. Edgar Hoover for his &quot;socialist&quot; views (such as championing civil rights for blacks and an eight hour work day, with a decent minimum wage), Prichard, not Johnson, went to prison and was disbarred.This short, but imminently well researched book is his story, recounting all his sparkling brilliance, the arrogance that helped bring him down, and his ultimate redemption as the father of the education reform movement in Kentucky. This is an elegantly written and masterfully documented history from a first rate young historian. The biggest revelation is the story of J. Edgar Hoover's targeting of Prichard, which was gleaned from declassified documents, and never previously reported.If this book teaches us that we are all flawed, it also teaches that we are all capable of redemption. This is one of the finest biographies I have ever read."},{"Title":"Short of the Glory: The Fall and Redemption of Edward F. Prichard Jr.","review":"This book tells well of a brilliant student, high in the ranks of his class at harvard Law, law clerk to Justice Frankfurter, holding responsible positions in the Government in wartime Washington, who by an unbelievably reckless and stupid act destroyed his career, then , after years of struggle redeemed himself before his death in 1984. This is a most worthwhile read for anyone interested in the law or in Kentucky politics,or in the shakers and movers in Washington in the 1940s."},{"Title":"Short of the Glory: The Fall and Redemption of Edward F. Prichard Jr.","review":"Edward F. Prichard, Jr.'s life makes for high drama; this excellent biography makes for engrossing and informative reading. &quot;Prich&quot; was yet another of the terribly bright Frankfurter students at Harvard Law School in the late 1930's who gravitated to Washington, first as a Supreme Court clerk to Frankfurter, and later with involvement in New Deal and wartime public service. The Greek chorus appears when Prichard returns to his home state of Kentucky to practice law. The book superbly recounts his conviction in connection with a 1948 vote-tampering scandal, his incarceration, and his eventual return to the practice of law and a role as respected educational reformer in Kentucky. Unfortunately, serious illness inflicted near blindness and other frailties which ultimately caused an early death at the age of 69. The reader can only sit back and wonder as to why one with such unlimited promise and talents chose the course he did. Nonetheless, as the book traces Prich's life, it provides an fascinating perspective on Harvard Law, Frankfurter, the wartime FDR administration, the early presidency of Truman, and the rise of the super lawyer-lobbyists such as Thomas Corcoran. One's time is well invested in reading this volume."},{"Title":"Deliverance Drive","review":"This book was spectacular. I really enjoyed readingit.

Memories of trying to understand long division in fourth grade can still make me squirm. Algebra was a lost year of my life - I had no idea what the teacher was talking about. Wouldn't you just guess I'd end up with a son who could add two digit numbers in his head before he started kindergarten? (I'm over 40 and I still can't do it very well) He even thought it was fun to do so.You can probably guess that the normal elementary school math curriculum did not thrill him. Fortunately, early on, his kindergarten teacher lent me her copy of this book, and suggested that it might help him get started on understanding some higher math concepts, while still being age appropriate. The words &quot;higher math&quot; were not exactly music to the ears of a math phobe like me. But within a couple of weeks, after trying out a few games, I was hooked, and bought my own copy.During the time he was in elementary school, I think we did at least 3/4 of the activities in the book, not because I thought he should, but because he wanted to. And, to my enormous surprise, so did I. The games and activities in this book are so intriguing that even I began to develop a sense of what it must feel like to really love math. (And, amazingly enough, I even got a little better at basic arithmetic.) Several of the games were so much fun, they became obsessions. We played them day after day.My younger child, who recently finished kindergarten, doesn't remotely share her brother's love of numbers, but this year I dug out my old copy of the book to see if it might get her more interested. Sure enough, it worked. The games of logic and the games designed to develop rapid mental arithmetic skills that so fascinated her brother don't really interest her. In fact, most of the book is still way beyond her skill level. But I've found quite a few games that are appropriate for a child still struggling to add and subtract single digit numbers. (She says they're more fun than the math games they play at school). And there are several activities (Tangrams, and Color Designs, for instance) that take advantage of her love of art to help her understand math better. At the end of kindergarten, my daughter told me that her favorite school subject was math. I have no doubt that her exposure to Family Math games had a lot to do with that. And I have no doubt that we'll be using this book more and more over the next few years."},{"Title":"Family Math (Equals Series)","review":"Fantastic!

Written with co-author Marie Hecht in 1968, \\"Never Again\\" is the story of the dramatic and colorful 1940 presidential campaign, which featured two of the most attractive and dynamic presidential candidates of the twentieth century: Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt and Republican Wendell Willkie. Roosevelt was running for an unprecedented third term as President, and Willkie may rank as the ultimate underdog, dark-horse presidential candidate.Willkie wasn't even a politician in 1940 - he'd never held a single political office. Instead, he was a dynamic and self-made businessman from Indiana who kept up the pretense of being a shrewd country boy who'd made \\"good\\" in the big city of New York. In reality Willkie was an extremely intelligent and well-read man who had become popular with Liberal Northern Republicans by becoming an articulate and thoughtful critic of Roosevelt's New Deal programs. Willkie had been raised as a Democrat and had given money to Roosevelt's first presidential campaign in 1932, only to regret it when FDR used the federal government to break up the electrical power monopoly (Commonwealth and Southern), of which Willkie was CEO. He only switched to the GOP in the late thirties, which led many conservative Republicans in the Midwest to oppose him as a \\"Johnny-come-lately\\" who was too liberal for most Republicans. It's hard to imagine someone like Willkie being nominated by the Republicans today - he was a supporter of the New Deal welfare programs, and his main criticism of FDR was that his New Deal programs needed to be more friendly to businesses and corporations and that the bloated gov't bureacracy created by the New Deal should be streamlined. Most conservative Republicans simply wanted to abolish the New Deal and go back to the small gov't, low-tax days of the past, which Willkie said was impossible.Willkie's nomination at the GOP Convention in Philadelphia in June 1940 was something of a miracle, and this book is at its best when describing Willkie's dramatic come-from-nowhere rise to the nomination. In January 1940 few Republicans had even heard of Wendell Willkie. However, the other leading candidates all had serious flaws - the frontrunner, New York's famed District Attorney Thomas Dewey, was only 38 years old, and many Republicans felt that he was simply too young and inexperienced in foreign affairs to be President. When the Nazis conquered France and Western Europe in May 1940, Dewey's stock dropped quickly. The conservatives' favorite candidate was Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio, but his bland speaking style and icy personality led some Republicans to fear that he would lose as many votes as he attracted. Taft was also an isolationist who wanted to avoid war at all costs, and with the Nazis menacing Britain as the Convention began, some Republicans felt that his isolationism would be a handicap in a campaign against FDR. In effect, Willkie stepped into a vacuum, and his colorful personality and dynamic speaking style won over many converts who liked him in spite of his liberalism and recent conversion to Republicanism. At the GOP Convention - the authors note that no one who was there would ever forget it - Willkie's supporters packed the galleries and kept yelling \\"We Want Willkie\\". Willkie trailed in the early voting, but he steadily gained strength on each ballot until he was finally nominated, to the delight of his supporters, who cried, stomped their feet, and danced in the aisles.Roosevelt, meanwhile, cleverly played a waiting game and only agreed to run at the last minute. The presidential campaign itself was something of an anticlimax - the inexperienced Willkie waged a gallant campaign, but lost his voice and had to speak in a whisper for most of the fall. Roosevelt wound up winning an historic third term by a comfortable 55-45% margin, but Willkie did claim the highest vote ever recorded by a GOP presidential candidate, and the authors argue that if World War Two had not been going on, Willkie might well have won (FDR was afraid he was going to lose right up until election night). In a nice contrast to modern campaigns, FDR met Willkie after the election and came to have a great deal of respect for him, even noting that it was \\"too bad that we (Democrats) lost him\\". If you're a political buff then this book should be a delight (I'd also recommend reading Herbert Parmet's \\"Jack: The Struggles of John F. Kennedy\\", which is one of the best political biographies of JFK that I've read). Recommended!"},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"This is a well-written collection of essays by Cahill, subtitled \\"Adventure is a Risky Business,\\" that succeeds best when Cahill is trying to make due with human nature rather than mother nature. Or, possibly, that's just where my interests lie. Even arm-chair tourists whose idea of \\"getting back to nature\\" is a stroll down the block can't help but envy Cahill as he is pushed in assignment after assignment in which he looks danger in the face and blows it a raspberry, and then falling on his face. Woah, that extended one metaphor to the breaking point, which Cahill tends to do at times as well. But don't think all is just chills and thrills here. There's some social commentary (some biting, some toothless), vivid description, outlandish occurrences, and breathtaking wonder. It may seem at times that you're reading a transcript for \\"NOVA,\\" but is that so bad? Cahill's written two other volumes like this--A Wolverine is Eating My Leg and Pecked to Death by Ducks--which I plan to find and read, and that's probably recommendation enough for this volume."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"TIM CAHILL is one of the best travel/adventure writers in the business.

Every time."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"A roaring good read. This set of Tim Cahill's travel essays isn't quite as funny as some of his others, but is a fascinating look at the world from someone who's been all over it. These are essays for those of us who would love to travel to strange, exotic (and not so exotic) places if it weren't for the fact that it'd be so darn uncomfortable. I particularly like to read him while in an extremely comfortable house in a quiet suburb in an out-of-the-way, boring part of the planet. Since this is a collection of essays, they will start to run together after a few.Pros -+ A fascinating look at places all over the world+ Easy read+ Tim Cahill does some amazing stuff and writes about it engagingly+ Is a good book for short periods of reading, say with breakfast or in the powder roomCons -- The author has a definite world-view that sometimes has a heavy tone- Not a cover-to-cover readAn interesting read for armchair travelers.RecommendedCFH"},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"I have read another book by Cahill; Pecked to death by ducks, wich I found funnier and more positive, more upbeat. The stories in this particular book are longer and not as happy. There's more doom (the turtles, it's heartbreaking!). Although Cahill is a happy madman as ever and a good writer of stories like this, my own goal with reading this book was to have a few good laughs and a smile on my face when finished. But I wasn't smiling to much, after all those grim stories of what people are doing to their own environment.

For the first time, I found myself bored reading a Cahill collection. PECKED TO DEATH BY DUCKS or ROAD FEVER are far superior works because they contain essays that are much funnier and less redundant."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"This book was a great quick read. Cahill's humorous writing style makes it hard to put the book down. Though a couple of the stories overlapped, I would recommend this book to anyone who dreams of doing something or going somewhere off the beaten path."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"I found this book to be extremely boring - it jumped from topic to topic, from location to location, without any explanation of who, why, where etc., and no sense of &quot;leading into...&quot;. I had just read Bill Bryson's books and found them most entertaining, but Tim Cahill, I just could not identify with. He's certainly had major adventures, but his style is just so unemotional, so factual i.e. I did this, went there, climbed that, drank that... but I just couldn't identify with him. No empathy or amusement whatsoever. I love adventure books but this one I just found very dull and unimaginitive."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"This was yet another thrift shop purchase for under a dollar and it was a dollar well spent. Tim Cahill's travel writing is punchy, funny and downright irreverent in places. It is also poignant, and darkly humorous, a travel book with a difference. Peru, Africa, Austrailia and even America are discussed from his unique point of view. An especially good chapter is &quot;Life and Love in Gorilla Country&quot; a journey through Rwanda and the secret world of the Gorilla. It is not a sentimental chapter, it is brutal, sometimes funny but more often that not eye opening. He talks about how Gorillas have died at the hands of poachers and mentions the work of the Naturalist Dian Fossey. This travel book is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted. Also it meanders a lot, jumping from place to place, subject to subject. You have to prepared to read it as a series of essays, travel logs articles that Cahill has written over the years and then put together to make up this book. However in this case it works and it is excellent from page one onwards. If you want a read with a sting in its tail, then this is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"If Cahill lived in Ancient Greece, he would be writing about encounters with the Cyclops and the Scylla and Charibdis. Maybe it's because Cahill writes about all the stuff I would do if I could quit my job and still pay the bills--exploring ruins in Peru, sea kayaking in Alaska, watching Mt. St. Helens erupt, saving the Olive Ridley Sea Turtle, scuba diving with sharks, riding in a C-130 Hurricane Hunter, and living in Montana--but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While Cahill might not be as witty as my favorite travel writer, Bill Bryson, he makes up for it by writing about adventures that would make Indiana Jones quake with fear. All of this is presented in a down-to-earth style that makes you wish you could hang out and drink a few beers with the guy."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"The best thing about Tim Cahill books, this one included, is that they are made up of perfect end-of-the-day-sized chunks that whisk you off to far points in the company of a humble but articulate and informed travelling companion. For everyone who may never spelunk, rappell, canoe down the Amazon, or face bison in mid-winter, but wishes they could!If you liked this, you'd probably like &quot;Pecked to Death by Ducks&quot; even more."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"One of my favorites. Author of Pecked to Death By Ducks and A Wolverine is Eating My Leg, Cahill, a founder of Outside Magazine, has perfected the art of the short travel essay. There are man-eating sharks, dangerous cave diving, eating cheese in a yurt in Mongolia and all sorts of ridiculous first hand escapades all over the globe. He is brilliant and brilliantly funny. Perfect travel book to take along on a trip. If you want to learn how to write, read Cahill and pay close attention to his introductions and conclusions."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"Cahill's books were recommended to me for some time before I read one. I just couldn't imagine that 'humorous adventure writing' was something that would appeal to me. Wrong! What is great about Cahill's pieces is that the humor is strictly at his own expense and the adventure is real. Make no mistake, this guy can really write. For example, when he ruminates about what is in store for him on a proposed dive in shark infested waters, he conjures up images of terror that any of us can relate to and then takes us to laughter with his description of his own terrified reations - which wouldn't be funny if it was US and WE were going to face the killer sharks.These pieces are a real treat; a taste of a lifestyle that we can only dream of, and laughs that keep us from being too covetous of it. Cahill is an American original."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"Cahill is fun to read; not as funny as Dave Barry, and not as (what?) thoughtful or thought-provoking as John McPhee, but fun. Cahill is (or does a good job of convincing us he is!) a Regular Guy in the Dave Barry sense, but he gets paid to go to interesting places and do exciting things. He tells us what that's like in a friendly journalistic style laced with well-done humor.One warning: the sequencing of the essays leaves something to be desired. In particular, the last four or five pieces are all rather dark and dismal contemplations of tragedy and mortality, with almost no humor. You might want to read them first, or sometime in the middle, rather than come away from the book on such a depressing note."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"If you are familiar with other Tim Cahill books, this contains similar stories; sky dives, sea dives, caving, climbs, and so on. It has more stories than usual about his own part of the world (Montana near Yellowstone) and lets us see in one story a strong sense of outrage at events surrounding endangered species in Mexico. If you prefer your authors to at least have strong feelings about some topics (I do), and the heck with dispassionate journalism, there's some satisfaction here.Everything from proper approaches to mountain gorillas to the eruption of Mt. St. Helens is here, and the stories are usually quick reads. Perfect reading for those who grab their moments of reading enjoyment in blocks of 5-10 minutes in between other activities.Can't see how it could fail to appeal."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"Cahill's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste. This is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained - some missing context, some missing closure. And they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense, as stories may focus on nature, archaeology, sociology, etc. While the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference, there is good information (ex. &quot;wisdom&quot; of cave diving). Some stories hit the vicarious adventurer's sweet spot. The author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in Kentucky, engaging the reader with educational content (ex. barometric effect on air flow), spectacular descriptions(ex. lightening igniting bat guano), and hair raising suspense (ex. getting lost in a maze of passages). Not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me, but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"Tim Cahill is the Dave Barry of the outside world. I subcribe to &quot;Outside&quot; magazine just to read Cahill's articles. Most of his stuff is funny, but he is serious at times, but not for long. This book is a nice anthology of his earlier articles. If you like the outdoors and like to laugh, get this book."},{"Title":"Jaguars Ripped My Flesh","review":"At the bookstore where I work, a customer once came in to ask for this book and asked for &quot;Sharks Ripped off my Arms.&quot;!This is not a travelogue so much as a collection of essays, most originally published in \`Outside' magazine, of which Cahill is an editor. As such, these make for interesting reading whether or not you are planning an excursion to any of the places Cahill talks about. His focus in these essays is understanding the undercurrents of place - whether he is in Montana or Peru or the Australian Outback - the culture, the history, and the complex relationships between travelers and residents. Some of the author's excursions have been downright life-threatening, such as when he and two other men went on an extended trek in the state of Chachopayas in Peru in a search for unexplored ruins. Wherever his travels take him, Cahill describes the scene with humor, intelligence and balance. This is not a tourist who expects hot showers and a McDonald's at every stop, this is a world adventurer who wants to see and experience everything he can. And then write about it."},{"Title":"America Rules: US Foreign Policy, Globalization and Corporate USA","review":"An insightful book that is most revealing of the globalization that has taken place while America sleeps.

There is, though, one flaw: Most of the large color plates are spread across the spine of the book. This is not a problem for most, but as an art student, studying the paintings with 15% lost in the spine is a problem."},{"Title":"What Great Paintings Say: Old Masters in Detail (Examining Paintings)","review":"The book is fascinating. The reproductions are big and good, and the text is readable and jargon-free. The authors present a painting, then provide a historical and social analysis of what the time's effects were on the artist and how to read below the surface of the picture, illustrating their points with details drawn from the work. In the few cases where I was acquainted with the works and their times, I found the interpretations spot on.This is a book that will help anyone interested in art, art history, or just plain history to develop a fuller understanding of great artists and of the times when they lived."},{"Title":"What Great Paintings Say: Old Masters in Detail (Examining Paintings)","review":"I bought this book hoping that it will explain to me why some painters are so highly regarded and other copy caps are not. Book basically goes over mostly Renocence pictures and tell the story behind each painting either what it depicts in terms of symbolism or history behind it or resons and financing behind it. It is a combination History book and paintings. It tells yo that for example Boticelli's Birth of Venus is first in Ronecance for nudity but it does not tell me why her feet is crooked, why anybody else who probably did similar paintings at the same time did not get this much fame. That is what I was looking and could not find. Still looking for the right book but this book by itself is very good for the purpose of its design."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"I'm not sure how anyone could ever dismiss Ed Sanders' \\"The Family,\\" a detailed account of Charles Manson and the murders his Family committed during the summer of Woodstock, 1969. A superb companion book to Vincent Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter,\\" Sanders' \\"The Family\\" is an alternative trip through the madness that defines one of the most infamous and horrifying crimes in American history.While \\"Helter Skelter\\" is a factual, by-the-numbers recount, \\"The Family\\" is an attempt to get beneath the surface of these unimaginable crimes. Sanders, a pseudo hippie himself, well-versed in the howling of beatnik eras and the twang of Bob Dylan travels, had unparalleled leeway into the lives of Manson's followers before and during the criminal trials of 1970. He hung with the waifs at Spahn ranch before it burned to the ground. He camped with these very weird kids in Death Valley. And he caught wind of the numerous crazy rumors that floated around like so much LA smog while writing alongside the army of TV/print reporters covering the trial. His work is valid, and his opinions cut through much of the myth and legend of this case. It is also the first true book ever released on this case, having been published in 1971.Sanders' flippant disregard for Manson's con, and the con of his worshipers, is refreshing. His style reminds me of the extraordinary ruminations of Evan S. Connell in \\"Son of the Morning Star\\" - a fantastic work dealing with another rather bloody historical event (Custer and Little Big Horn). Sanders refuses to accept the myth or the legend, and reveals the dirty, flea-bitten truth. His is an unconventional, creative approach, told from the eyes of a most intelligent mind.But I still find much of Sanders' work to be extremely irresponsible. He recounts many of the urban myths surrounding this crime, including Manson's supposed alliances with Satanic cults, weird mysterious videotapes existing (yet disappearing) that reportedly show eventual victims with the Family, filmed sacrifices, CIA involvement, political connections stretching all the way to Washington D.C., and so on add nausea give me a break.The Manson trial was a circus, and the conspiracy theories that spewed forth rivaled the theories surrounding yet another 1960s crime known as the JFK assassination. These were horrible times in American history, California Dreaming or not, and the simple fact of the matter is that Charles Manson and his family lived a counterculture lifestyle that was hip with middle class and upper-middle class culture during this era. They hung, ever-so-briefly, with the young in-crowd of Hollywood. But when the constant use of psychedelic drugs, combined with the unique isolation of Spahn ranch, began to take hold, Manson and his family entered a deadly alternative world having no touch with reality. The in-crowd slams the door in their face, the hope for rock and roll superstardom disappears, Manson becomes God, it's time to strike back at the rich and powerful piggies. It's such a sad and ugly story.Sanders perhaps gets closer to the truth than any writer ever truly has with these crimes. It's all here, urban myths, unsolved crimes in the same neighborhood, animal bones, dirty laundry, uneducated white trash motivation spawned by years of institutionalization. It's Group Think at its worst formed by the hangover of one endless lost summer weekend.\\"The Family\\" is my third book to read on Manson's pathetic crimes. I find it telling that after reading Sanders' influential work, I realize I now know all I ever really want to know."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"While no Manson book will ever tell the true story, due to variations of 'truth' amongst those involved, this book as a facinating look into a certain era in American history that is too easily glossed over with tye-dye and lava lamps.

PS- Blue and Red have both denounced it, so there must be a kernal of truth in here somewhere."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Anyone who has just finished Helter Skelter should graduate to this book.Sanders lived with the remaining family members while gathering info on the book."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Is it possible to present facts in an enteraining manner?

The writing was not always perfect but the story seems true from a different perspective, not just legal mumbo jumbo. It is a classic."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"A perfect companion to Vincent Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"The Family\\" was written by Ed Sanders, one time member of the \\"counter culture\\" 60's act The Fugs. Like Bugliosi, Sanders had first hand contact with The Manson Family in the late 60's/early 70's, however unlike Bugliosi he was not a straight prosecutor but (admittedly) a member of \\"the underground press\\" and a dyed in the wool hippie. Sanders occasionally deviates through some wacky borderline conspiracy theories, though always leaving you to draw your own conclusions. The fact that he took numerous trips out to the desert to mix with the Family while writing this book is akin to frontline tours of duty as a war correspondent and adds to the realism as he breaks bread with Manson's murder zombies. I've read this book five times over the past three years and each time its as chilling as the first when you realize that an ex-con hijacked the peace and love generation by collecting damaged youth and utilizing his control skills learned as a former pimp which combined with liberal doses of hallucinogenic drugs helped him create his morbid dream world of racial unrest, murder and mayhem, that was quite possibly just a mask for a personal, money and drug fueled related agenda."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"when i saw that he had consulted with famed investigator Maury Terry of the master work \\"The ultimate evil\\" I instantly knew this book had tremendous value. And I was correct. The back ground and following the tentacles of this case that reach around the country, and having the courage to follow up the satanic cult angle was well as the scientology and mind control aspect gave me so much more than i hope for. This is a must read with the book \\"the ultimate evil\\" so much is contained in Maury's book that sheds much light on the significance of the satanic cult aspect. This case is far from closed. It is obvious to me that behind the scenes it is still being investigated.On his writing style. I believe it was perfect for this. I \\"get\\" him and much of the code language he uses to hint at things only insiders know. I do believe has has much more information on this subject than he can disclose, and he even admits it if you read closely.How some could rate this book so below an all star is beyond my understanding.Highly recommended book.Thanks Ed.

Sanders acts as your personal guide through the morass of Manson's ritual/hate killings, sex/terror/mind control cult, and the rather colorful characters and locations that floated/hovered around the man. Don't expect a cut and dry 540 pg written version of an episode of 'unsolved mysteries'. the reader definitely must appreciate Sanders' sense of humor and rhythm of verse to fully engage in the tale he weaves. highly recommended as a first read into the love and terror cult."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"If you want to get down to the nitty gritty of what made the Manson Family tick, this is the best source to date. Sanders was able to speak with many people who would never have been so open with Bugliosi or his associates. Read this book for more of an inside perspective than can be had from Helter Skelter.One caveat is it helps to already have at least a passing familiarity with the hipster lingo and historical background of the time during which the book was written. L7 folks might want to read up on the history of hippie era first as background."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This is the best book on Manson, the whole Helter Skleter story, period.. Not sure if it's all factual or not. I have read many different things saying it is, it isn't. It's a great book. And incredible story and my favorite on the subject of Manson. I have a top 5 Manson book list that I think gives you a better picture of the whole story if you read them all. This is may favorite. A must read if you're a fan of this subject and story. This subject has so many twists, turns and side stories happening. It's just an incredible story. My picks in order on this subject are - 1) The Family, 2) Shadow Over Santasusana, 3) Manson: In His Own Words, 4) Will You Die For Me?, 5) Helter Skelter."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"More knowlege on Manson and the famley anywere given"},{"Title":"The Family","review":"I could only get about 50 pages into the book. It started off promisingly enough, as a purported detailed account into the backstories of the people involved in the Manson murders of the late 60s. The problem, however, is that Sanders does not cite sources, he makes innuendoes, and editorializes all the way. Granted its hard to approach the subject without an opinion, but do we really need someone MAKING SOUND EFFECTS as part of the narration? Good writing should leave the sound effects to the reader. Half the time, I couldn't tell what in the factual events Sanders was talking about. People were hinted at, but never named. I couldn't keep straight Sanders' imaginings from what sources told him, from what may or may not have happened. Sanders himself appears a little suspect as his claim to fame is some filthy hippie folkie pranksterism, and for all I know, maybe he's pissed off that he didn't think about starting a cult first. While there is a need for more subtstantive information apart from the Bugliosi, this simply isn't it.And here's the bottom line: murder is tragic, and to try to cash in on murder goes beyond tragic to heinous. There was nothing in the 50 pages that I read to suggest to me that Sanders wrote this out of anything but a desire to cash in on the misery of others. Its so sloppily written and undocumented that you can't even slap a 'search for the truth' sticker onto it.It is, however, a good example of what happens to pot smoking folkies who can't focus on what they're writing."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Author Ed Sanders cannot write to begin with. Making sound effects is another annoying matter. I guess he wrote this book like he is talking to someone. But, speaking and writing is really a different matter. I don't know if his facts are all correct but reading through this book is difficult because the auther cannot, I repeat, cannot write. I first thought maybe Sanders is a foreigner, but I think what he really needs is to go back to grammer school."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"I did not care for this book. It contained more speculation than fact, and it contained many discrepencies. There are better books written about the Tate-LaBianca murders. The only good thing that I can say is that it has some good pictures, but thanks to the internet, these can be found anywhere."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Sanders' writing was so abysmal that I couldn't stomach more than one chapter of this book. The continuity was fragmented and jolting. Facts were stacked on top of each other helter skelter (pun intended) with no apparent connection between them. And the prose was so sophomoric and smart-alecky that it was embarrassing to read. How did this book every get published? Didn't the publisher have any editors on board to tame Sanders' bizarre use of the English language into a readable narrative?"},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This was a poorly written book and I lost interest in it about 20 pages in. It felt like the author was just trying to make some money (another book about someone elses misfortune, pain etc) and rewriting the same information other people have already written. This subject is like the game &quot;telephone&quot;. Wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever picked up. The author purports to be a poet, which, if true, is tragic indeed.The very first paragraph of the book has a hanging sentence, \\"There was.\\" Is this some poet's idea of an ontological statement? Or just sheer sloppiness?On page 9, we are treated to the sentence, \\"Of irony,[how about 'ironically'? it's a perfectly good word here.] Manson seems [seems? It's pretty well documented that he did.] to have become a protege in prison of probibition gangster Alvin Karpis, a member of the evil [Wow; labelling something in a book on Manson has to be done in soemwhat relative terms; but I am glad that he let us know who the bad guys were here!] Ma Barker gang, which left fourteen victims dead.\\"Let's go to page 53, where we read that \\"Rosemary's Baby, a saga of satanic chauvinism, is a story about the big-league affluent hail-Satan [that's a mouthful] crowd and their evident [Again, isn't the qualifier here a bit too cute?] success in getting Satan to make pregnant [I think the proper verb is \\"impregnate.\\"] an innocent {is there any other kind?] female victim, played by Mia Farrow.\\"Later, we read that \\"She stayed with the film; Sinatra left her, and so another headline sequential monogamy entered the dust.\\" Good god.I hope you get the picture. This fellow needed a good editor and a decent English teacher in high school.I am sure that this book contains stuff not found in other Manson books. It is a laudatory effort for this, and this alone. It's quite a lengthy book. But trying to read it is, for anyone with other than a tin ear, an impossible task, unless one has at hand a bottle of decent Scotch, some nice music, and a wicked sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Sorry to say it, but this book is not very good at all. There is no depth or scope to it, not getting inside the people. The writing it tricky and flashy and does not balance out with the horrors these people perpetrated. I do not believe this author got to know his subject matter very well, and has offered only a glib, clever style to cover up for his lack of understanding his subject. I have read the book, MANSON, by John Gilmore, and find it to be the best one showing the Manson side of the story. HELTER SKELETR shows it from the police side. Either are better than this poorly done book."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"How did this get published? This is without doubt one of the worst writers in the world.

It really doesn't tell about the murders that he had commited. It tells about his childhood and why he was in jail all of the times. The book tells about why he had started a clan and what kind of people had to be in it. If you like to read about Charles Manson then this is a good book to read about his life. I thought that the book was pretty good. It really didn't tell about the murders that he commited but it did tell about his life."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"even though no one can be sure of what is the truth or fiction this book gets more into the Family life rather than the murders. A good look at the inside of the members and how they lived. A must read for anyone who read Helter Skelter."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"There were times that I had to put this book down as it deals with extremely unpleasant things that really happened.

It covers virtually every aspect of this bizaare chapter in American history. Taken from the viewpoint of another hippie, the author lends a discerning eye to this. While others would simply try to discount the whole hippie movement, he simply sought out the truth instead of simple blanket condemnation.There are a few unbecoming aspects to this. The free-form, stream of consciousness feel to it makes it hard to read. While the narrative would be following something along, there would be these interruptions. Pieces of text that would fit the moment if someone was telling this story around a campfire. things like, \\"and Manson did this. Ooohh-eeee-oohhh! The ad-hoc comments and bizaare descriptions made this feel like someone narrating a documentary.I do like that the author followed Manson and his followers from inception to the most recent times. It gave me some insight as to why they did what they did and left few loose ends. I also enjoyed the fact that rumors and speculation were added in at times. The various rumors and rampant speculation that surrounded this case are some of the aspects that make it unique. It gives it more life and relevancy than just an objective detail by detail exposition.Overall, it is good but readers be warned. The style is different. The style and the flow are not typical. With so many details, it can be confusing."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Not many good books about the family as a whole. This one is."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This book seems VERY anti-Manson. There are some things in it that I know are not true because of reading \\"Helter Skelter\\" & legal court documents. Manson has always claimed there was never a \\"Family.\\" It puts practically ALL the blame on Manson & none on the killers-which is absolutely ridiculous. I would suggest \\"Helter Skelter\\" or \\"The Shadow Over Santa Susana\\" by Adam Gorightly-- which seems to be a more accurate account."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"So far, I've read 300 + pages out of the 500+ pages and it is very detailed! It is very informative!"},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This is, quite simply, the definitive book on Charlie and his demented followers. Sanders' research is clearly exhaustive and he presents his material in unsensational terms, unlike lawyer Vincent Bugliosi's Helter Skelter.For anyone interested in its subject, this should be the first port of call. You won't need another,"},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This book does a great job of presenting ample \\"food for thought\\" about a group of people who, to this day, manage to mystify us in regard to their motives, views, etc.This book does not do a great job with continuity as the writing jumps around by presenting facts and ideas about subjects that have yet to be introduced and/or explained. The author also likes to uses terms and references to people, places and things that the reader has no idea about. One example is the first reference to The Diggers. I had to look up the subject on the Internet and by the time I found out who The Diggers were the momentum intended by reading the author's work had disappeared. A second example is a first reference to \\"Wavy\\" without an explanation of who Wavy is and then a later explanation of who he is.If you can get past issues like the aforementioned you will have an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"As others have pointed out, the style of writing detracts so much that this book is nearly unreadable. Sanders presents facts, conjectures, conspiracies, and rumor without any footnoting or biography-- it is left to the reader to speculate, from other sources, what is truly known and what he is guessing at. Sanders also uses a mix of \\"colorful hippie-speak\\" presumably from the 60s(?) such as \\"laid a small blue tab of dope on him\\" rather than \\"gave him LSD\\", and unusual vocabulary and wordings (\\"hemographic\\" rather than \\"bloody\\", \\"...the beautiful Gypsy the Magna Mater embodiment and Leslie and Beausoleil and two unknown female caucasians...\\"), which tamper with narrative coherence.At any rate, just when an anecdote gets interesting, Sanders interrupts it. Several pages of the photos in the book are unlabeled. Sanders is obsessed with black magic and conspiracy, and much of the book feels unreliable because of the author's infatuation with the mystique of his association with the Manson family. With the resources and experiences Sanders had available to him, it is extraordinarily unfortunate that this is the result."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"Although I am a \\"fan\\" of this subject (and I don't think it is appropriate to term it that way) I found this book to be a collection of facts and stories from those who know and a huge way for the author to plug his own projects. If I had to read about his damn record (which he names several times in the book with very loose ties to the actual story ) I was going to throw it against the wall. I do not think I learned anything that was not covered in \\"Helter Skelter\\" and the authors use of slang was, in my opinion, a pathetic attempt at being cool.Dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"This publisher (Thunder's Mouth) who prides itself on being reasonably hip, has succeded in dishing up a reprint of a long-ago dismissed tome by the would-be or always-wanted-to-be-a-Beat-poet, Ed Sanders, who was always a better kazoo player with the Fugs than he ever was a writer. THE FAMILY is clearly what Sanders has dreamed up what it has to be like being part of Manson's Family. This book is trival (as it was in the original edition), flip and \\"cute,\\" smug and dumb, as is much of what Sanders passes off as serious writing. When he sticks to facts he's borrowed from newspapers and other public domain material, he manages to give the reader a little legitimate information, albeit redundant, but all the rest of this is coy, fictitious junk. Pass on this book, unles you are bored to death with reality and want a little \\"I wish I could be cool\\" quasi-Beat chest thumping. There are far better books written on Manson and the Family, like HELTER SKELTER, and like MANSON: THE UNHOLY TRAIL. These books offer real perspective. Ed Sanders offers little more than Ed Sanders."},{"Title":"The Family","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Not that I expected much from Ed Sanders, who is generally a very pompous, self-important writer, but I had hoped for some serious info on Charlie Manson. What I got here was more of Sanders posturing about what a great writer he is. The sobering fact is that he isn't. Save your money and don't waste your time looking for any insight into Charlie Manson in this one. I'm not sure why it was ever published."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"I found this book in the attic covered under piles of dust. I did not know what it was about as it did not have a cover or anything telling what the book was about. I decided to give it a try and was immediatly submersed in the world of the 1800's. I could not put the book down after the first page. it took me about 2 days to complete the whole book. The author, Giles, is very descriptive and exciting writer. Usually i do not like to read books set in the 1800's, but this book is excellent. It is about the life of Rebecca Fowler. It starts with her early life chasing the man she loves and evovles as Rebecca does into her life story. It talks of life in the wilderness and then life while she is involved in a Shaker community and life thereafter. This is an excellent book and i cannot wait to read more book written by Giles."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"From beginning to end I was drawn into the lives of all the caratures. Being from Kentucky and visiting Shakertown, I was able to use my imagination and see different sides of how they lived. It brought out both the pros and cons to their living. I also liked how a woman in that time was able to be strong and go with her &quot;beliefs&quot;."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"This books takes you on journey through the eyes of an early pioneer of Kentucky into a Shaker community. It is well written with a compelling plot and keeps you interested until the end. Anyone who likes early pioneer history, Kentucky history, or religious communities of the 1800's will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"I was thrilled when I found this as a kindle book. It's a favorite of mine but all of her books tend to be my favorite!!! I'm hoping that the other books will be put in kindle format.

I am learning a lot about the Shakers which I find very interesting."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"Janet Giles weaves a superb tale of this piece of Americana. It is a wonderful balance of historical facts and creative renderings of the people and places during this time. I learned a great deal and had my interest peaked for more. I have continued reading her books and am not disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"Even though this book stands alone, it is better read in context with its two predecessors, The Kentuckians and Hannah Fowler. These books give the background to Rebekah and her extended family.I loved all of these books, but especially The Believers. A trip to Pleasant Hill and South Union Shaker Villages to see where these books actually took place was a great treat. Not only a great story, but also a wonderful look at a piece of little-known American religious history."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"I read this as a child, and again as an adult. I re-read it after I went to the Shaker community in Northern Kentucky and enjoyed it much more, but give me &quot;Hannah Fowler,&quot; &quot;Six Horse Hitch&quot; or &quot;Johnny Osage&quot; (all by Janice Holt Giles) anytime! She is a terrific author who has done better than this effort. But, it is still a good story...worth the read."},{"Title":"The Believers","review":"I have read many of Ms. Giles books and this one is by far my favorite! She truly reached out to me and because of her book I am contemplating converting to Shakerism! She makes the characters come alive, feel their feelings, and even though she shares it from a point of view against Shakers, she lets you form your own opinion. I worked at a Shakertown but nothing was as moving to me as this book!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge ... 4 American Climbers Kidnapped...","review":"This is the true story of four young Americans, three men and one woman, who in August of 2000 ventured into Kyrgyzstan in order to rock climb in the Pamir-Alai mountain range. On August 11, 2000, while climbing, they would suddenly find themselves the target of sniper fire. After their descent, they would find themselves taken at gunpoint and held hostage by young Islamic fundamentalists of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. They would join a Kyrgyz soldier whom the militants had already taken prisoner.The next six days would prove to be harrowing ones for these climbers, who would be marched thrugh the rugged terrain of the mountains with little food and water and constant threat of execution at the hands of their heavily armed captors. They would eventually see the their fellow captive, the Kyrgyz soldier with whom they had bonded, executed. With nothing to lose, they would be forced to make a life or death decision that was to cause them much angst but would allow for an escape.The author's presents a somewhat dry chronicle of these startling pre-9/11 events, which in hindsight now seem to have a much more evil and sinister portent. The story is also multifaceted in that it grounds what happened to these climbers in a global context, giving the historical backdrop and political dynamics of the area.The author fully lays out the media circus that enveloped the climbers upon their return to the United States. He also found himself becoming part of the story, as exclusivity and certain monetary arrangements he had made with the climbers threatened to dominate the story and cast a pall over the veracity of all. The author also lays out the secret pact that the climbers had made over the agonizing decision one of them had reached in order to effect their escape. It was a decision that they believed had led to the death of the captor who had been entrusted with keeping them captive.The media circus around what had happened to them turned decidedly ugly when it was discovered that this captor was still alive and under arrest. What he had to say would then throw the media into a further tailspin. Thanks to the power of television, however, a Dateline NBC interview with the captor at the heart of the storm of the controversy would finally put to rest some of the unsavory portions of this true life adventure.What really stands out is the naivete and ignorance of the climbers about the part of the world in which they were traveling. Notwithstanding the fact that none of them seemed to be particularly bright, they had done very little in terms of research into the area before traveling there nor had they heeded State Department advisories about the area. The climbers, in large part, remain somewhat of an enigma and, as such, the reader finds oneself caring very little about them.This news saga originally appeared as a gripping article in \\"Outside\\" magazine. I had the good fortune to have read it and was transfixed by what had happened. I believe it was this author who wrote the article. In writing this book, however, he seems to have sucked the life out of the story. While still worth reading, it is an adventure story uitterly devoid of passion."},{"Title":"The transformations of man","review":"Once in a great while, a major thinker emerges and presents us with insights into our civilization.

You can only guess which period of time she is talking about at any given point as the author does not go into great detail about Status Quo or what they did/do/plan to do. It is really a typical book by a dumped ex-wife with all the customary bitterness attached. You end up not believing her as she loses her objectivity early on. At the end of the day she was married to an amazing musician in a band that is now an institution. Who cares about Parfitt's personal life. Tell us about the band. If you don't know anything about the band this won't help you. And if you are an expert this book won't help you either. But can someone tell us what Rick Parfitt does with all the money he makes?

Their awesome chart success seems to have been forgotten behind a myth of monotonous three chord rock.

Typical, because no-one knows anything about the band nowadays. They still tour and pull big crowds, but radio doesn't play their records - like the young bands!

This is unfair. I would say Chance is Conrad's most beautiful story, the construction of the plot masterly from start to conclusion, and probably the only novel of his which genuinely leaves a good feeling and makes the reader smile. His handling of the material from Marlow the teller of the tale, the way the novels flits from present to the past and back again flawlessly, surprises one how so far ahead Conrad was compared to the standard straight-line story telling that dominated writing of that era. But bottomline is despite the technical perfection, a story would only succeed its telling if it has heart. Here Conrad never faltered and one feels for the heroine in the story, and it would be hard not to let out a whoop of bemused joy once the final page is turned. Simply sublime."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"I cannot believe that there are no customer reviews already for this spectacular novel - full of intruiging situations and wonderful characters - certainly the best Conrad female character I have read. Conrad is a wonderful writer in style and the manner in which he tells a yarn - how then has this novel become so 'lost'? It has wonderful lines ('Don't be in a hurry to thank me,' says he. 'The voyage isn't finished yet.' p22 Oxford World Classics), great insights (women respond to the smallest things, which immediately had me nodding in agreement from my own experience), spectacular descriptions ('Yes, I gave up the walk [along a cliff top with the intention of killing herself],' she said slowly before raising her downcast eyes. When she did so it was with an extraordinary effect. It was like catching sight of a piece of clear blue sky, of a stretch of open water. And for a moment I understood the desire of that man to whom the sea ans sky of his solitary life had appeared suddenly incomplete without that glance which seemed to belong to both of them. p231). The characters are admirable in behaviour sometimes, victims sometimes, regrettable in behaviour sometimes, or just plain confused - just like real people. But one thing I really like is the way the narrator of the story is an observer, barely a participant of the events being described.This may not be the perfect novel, but I urge you not to miss it. The chapter 'On the Pavement' by itself is worth the read!"},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"This book is just perfect. It's very well written. Conrad shows an understanding of the predicament of women of his time. Conrad advances the plot though the voice of the characters, who tell a story, which involves another character telling a story, etc. At one point the tale is six levels deep; but such is the skill of Conrad that you do not notice and are never lost. One of Conrad's two or three best. A book I was sad to end because I was enjoying it so much."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"So well-crafted, so engaging, so powerfully written - it's hard believing \\"Chance\\" was written by Joseph Conrad. Not that Conrad didn't write great books, just that nothing in \\"Lord Jim,\\" \\"Heart Of Darkness,\\" or the rest of his tough, unsettling oeuvre prepares you for the wry warmth and hidden sunlight of \\"Chance.\\"Well, you do have Marlow again. The narrator of \\"Jim\\" and \\"Darkness\\" is back here telling another story about people he doesn't actually know first-hand. This time the central character is young Flora de Barral, set adrift in England by her father's scandal-plagued financiering. Haunted and helpless, her wide blue eyes giving her the look of \\"a forsaken elf,\\" Flora takes what comes in life, seemingly unable to function for herself. Can she find her own way? Will she become ruthless if she tries?All this may sound precious and twee, very much in the style of period romances more suited to Henry James than what you expect from the shamelessly macho Conrad, with his damned souls sailing heedless into typhoons. Yet Conrad makes this odd Merchant-Ivory production work by making you care for Flora in a way that draws you in more deeply than even the classic \\"Lord Jim\\" ever did. \\"Jim\\" was a philosophical novel; \\"Chance\\" is a uniquely intuitive one, more about feelings than ideas, yet quite brilliant in its concept all the same.Published in 1913, one year before World War I would change forever the genteel world it so painstakingly describes, \\"Chance\\" was the one book by Conrad that clicked with readers in his own lifetime. It's been disregarded since, as modern readers embrace more dour Conrad fare like \\"The Secret Agent\\" and \\"Nostromo.\\"It's our generation's loss. Missing \\"Chance\\" is missing the other side of Conrad, the bleak nihilist discovering for once \\"the precise workmanship of chance, fate, providence, call it what you will.\\" Other Conrad books feature broken-up narratives and odd framing devices, but the structural convolutions in \\"Chance\\" actually propel the story rather than hold it back.Marlow's narration is a marvel of storytelling economy, carrying you across windswept moors and the high seas, not to mention a source of much dry wit as the rather mysterious misogynist fires many shots across the bow of womankind. \\"Mainly I resent that pretence of winding us around their dear little fingers, as of right,\\" he snorts.Is Flora exhibit A in this case against? Certainly she winds the helplessly infatuated Captain Anthony around her finger, despite her apparent total lack of reciprocal devotion. Flora does love, only it is in a flawed way, for her crabbed, corrupt father who believes the two of them too good for the rest of the world. Yet love can be a form of redemption despite itself.Women, Conrad writes, can be fiendish and dumb, yet they are \\"never dense.\\" \\"There is in woman always, somewhere, a spring.\\" Realizing that spring here is at the heart of \\"Chance,\\" and makes for Conrad's strangest triumph, the one book of his that not only makes you feel smarter for reading it, but happy to be alive."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"Chance is a wonderful Conrad novel that no one really pays attention to nowadays. True, it does not have the same magic as Lord Jim or Heart of Darkness, but it is brilliant in that Conradian way. It features the return of Marlow, so it is an especially interesting read for Conrad fans who have been with Marlow through other novels and stories. His role in this book is less hands-on. He does not have a very strong tie to the two characters he most discusses. He does, however, have a more active role in the actual narration. His audience this time is not passive, but questions his analyses and puts in their own ideas. A hilarious example:&quot;You are the expert in the psychological wilderness. This is like one of those Redskin stories where the noble savages carry off a girl and the honest backwoodsman with his incomparable knowledge follows the track and reads the signs of her fate in a footprint here, a broken twig there, a trinklet dropped by the way.&quot;For those unfamiliar with Marlow, the commentator is refering to his capacity for putting together pieces of information to create a sketch of a person, and we have to filter through some of Marlow's pretensions to get a real view of what is going on in his story. At one point, he compares women to electricity. Both have been captured, &quot;but what sort of conquest would you call it? (Man) knows nothing of it. And the greater the demand he makes on it in the exultation of his pride the more likely it is to turn on him and burn him to a cinder.&quot; Ah, Marlow, you rambling fool.This is the novel that brought Conrad popular success, rather late in his career. It is one of his only female characters with a dominant role, but don't expect a strong feminist type. Flora de Barral is naive, at the mercy of others and their wills. I didn't feel quite as close to the characters, and Conrad tries a little too hard to philosophize on the role of chance and circumstance in our lives. Still, very enjoyable, witty, pure Conrad that you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"My first Conrad read was Victory, and I have been hooked ever since. I chose Chance because it was Conrad's first commercial success, and I was curious to see what the public liked better than so many other great novels such as Lord Jim. As other reviewers have suggested, the ending must have been the difference. There is far more sweet than bitter, and it's usually the other way around in his books, especially the love stories. I suspect we may learn more from sad stories than from happy ones, but in any event, Chance is not without pain and suffering. As the capable narrator Marlowe repeatedly emphasizes, the novel's heroine, Flora, leads a difficult life. Her father is one of the great villans in literature. He really steals show from Marlowe--well, almost.What I like most about Conrad's use of the narrator, particularly in Chance, is his role as an interpreter. In most novels, the reader must examine the story itself for the life lessons Conrad so uniquely presents. Marlowe enables Conrad to speak more directly to the reader, and I found him doing so more in Chance than in Lord Jim. There are a few arguably gratutious digressions--one about the differences between men and women comes to mind--but that's Marlowe.The bottom line: if in reading Lord Jim, you really enjoyed Marlowe's character, you will love the extra depth and insight Chance provides. If you love Conrad, then I expect you will find this to be one his most enjoyable books. And, if you have never read Conrad, but are curious, this is an excellent novel to start with, for it cannot be sterotyped as a South Seas adventure novel full of Pacific atmosphere and nautical terms."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"Henry James didn't like Conrad's eighth novel, Chance. He criticized it as being \\"steeped in perfect eventual obscuration\\", with difficulties \\"wantonly evoked.\\" I disagree completely. \\"Chance\\" seems to me one of Conrad's most deliberate novels, one in which he achieved narrative virtuosity, making the title subtly ironic since from a structural viewpoint nothing is left to \`chance' and every twist of narration is superbly controlled. Curiously, the reading public in England and America may have felt the same admiration for this complex novel, since it became Conrad's first real \`best seller.'Henry James. Stephen Crane, Thomas Hardy, Edith Wharton, William Dean Howells, Ford Madox Ford, and Joseph Conrad. Are there any writers in English today who approach them in artistic \`specific gravity'? That is, in the density of nuance and complexity of characterization, let alone the sheer scope of language? Could any of them even get published today, or have a career as a writer? The perspicacity of the reading public of their generation is not to be despised!This novel is a tale retold by an unidentified narrator, of a tale told in several sessions by that consummate teller of tales, Marlow. But most of what Marlow tells is in turn second-hand retelling of what he has learned in explanation of events after the fact. Pay heed to the punctuation when you read this book; quotes within quotes within quotes abound. Yet this is anything but \`wanton.' Much of Conrad's understanding of life can be perceived in his characters' need to act on information they don't yet have and to proceed through the passage of time without the foresight of a novelist with a plot outline in hand.\\"High drama - suicide, swindles, elopement, love, murder - for a rousing good tale!\\" That's what the blurb on the dust-cover of my edition of Chance promises to the reader, and it's essentially true. But those crowd-pleasing elements could be written into a much less allusive, elusive pot-boiler by any old hack. Conrad, as usual, has written a novel that gets better the more you think about it, both while you read and after. \\"Chance\\" truly is the subject here, and I \`think' that Conrad was struggling to redefine the meaning of chance, in fictional illustration, from the older concept of \`luck' to a modern concept of \`contingency' or accident. The older sense of chance represented something internal - intrinsic - to the individual. That's why coincidences and chance encounters seemed so plausible to Victorian novelists; such \`chances' were bound to happen! The \`chances' that occur in Conrad's novel certainly determine the course of events, but they are NOT bound to happen. It's not claiming too much to say that Conrad was one of the first novelists in English to write in the post-Darwin climate of scientific relativism, of atomistic, impersonal chance.Long live Marlow! I'd give a gland to run across him in a hoary harbor tavern on the Thames, and to sit spellbound for an evening, listening to one of his wanton narrations!"},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"This is one of the few Conrads that I had not read before. From the descriptions I had gotten a wrong impression and had stayed away in the past. I expected a sombre rumination of female problems. Wrong expectations!It is Marlow's last performance, and it is more land-based than his 3 previous tales; but not entirely! Marlow has matured and has broader interests, he is looking into society, describes a strangely modern financial fraudster, takes up women's movement as a subject, with less than full enthusiasm.Marlow has changed his sense of humour, he is an ironist now. Past Marlows were entirely un-humorous, to the extent that I mistook him for Conrad and was surprised how funny some of Conrad's non-Marlow tales are. Take Secret Agent!Chance is as funny as Secret Agent. And yet it is also a Victorian standard plot, a damsel in distress story as any of the wildest romances of the previous century. If one would want to summarize the 'plot', it would sound very pedestrian, so I don't do it.Like Lord Jim, this novel started as a short story, initially called Dynamite. Like Rescue, Chance was interrupted and took years to be completed. Like Victory, it was an amazing commercial success for a writer who was a typical writer's writer: high reputation, little business. This book sold like hot cakes in the US and gave Conrad a comfortable last decade of his life.One might suspect the bestseller status was due to a misunderstanding, and the introduction to this edition presumes that Chance was a very unread bestseller. I am not so sure. The novel is quite entertaining. While the plot (fraudster's daughter in existential trouble gets rescued by sailor after going through all kinds of other people's schemes) is nothing spectacular, the manner of telling it is a very amusing way of the Marlow narration style: he collects bits and pieces from several sources and the tale's story is happening over 17 years. It is never a difficult structure and Marlow's ponderous style in, say, the Heart, is replaced by light-handed banter.I found it very enjoyable.'Luckily people are for the most part quite incapable of understanding what is happening to them; a merciful provision of nature to preserve an average amount of sanity.'"},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"A chance meeting with a Mr Powell leads Marlow to recollect his chance connections To the Feins-and Mrs Feins' brother Captain Anthony ; his chance meeting with Flora De Barrel,daughter of a disgraced financier,and their elopement on Anthonys ship.Chance occurances and happenings connect lifes machinations according to Conrad, and this story unfolds gracefully on such chances ,with the proceedings kept in witty check by Marlows narration.Conrad is the master of descriptive, meticulously detailed story telling and 'Chance' is no exception to this rule. Perhaps a little over long, and your sympathies wax and wane at times, but a great tale written in a style and manner few in the past-and possibly none today-could match and master,"},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"It is paradoxical that Conrad's most successful work at the time of its publishing should also be the least satisfactory of his major works. Narrated largely by Conrad's alter ego Marlow it is the story of young Flora de Barral who is torn emotionally between her imprisoned financier father (who bears a strong resemblance to Trollope's Augustus Melmotte) and Captain Anthony, the respected brother of her Feminist guardian Mrs Fyne. Written during the suffragette era Conrad attempts to address directly the issue of feminism but the prejudices of the time (Victorian/Edwardian) and his origins (Polish) act as impediments to his impartiality. Though I feel that it is a judgment based on today's standards to describe Marlow's narrative as misogynistic, it does at times make uncomfortable reading: \`...Mrs Fyne did not want women to be women. Her theory was that they should turn themselves into unscrupulous sexless nuisances'. As such it acts as unwitting historical testimony to male attitudes of Conrad's background at that time.Ostensibly a tale of doomed love Chance is an overlong and confusing nested narrative that nevertheless is a four-star work because it is a fine story written in a beautiful, dignified English that has long since been abandoned for a prose that is dull and functional or pompous and overblown. If you are a Conrad fan like me and you wish to \`complete the set' then it is an interesting diversion for that great author, though, not surprisingly, the best passages are on board The Ferndale. If you are new to Conrad then I don't recommend this as a starter. Instead go for any of his well-known works which are all readily available."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"Right. Hats off to the other reviewers here who, to a one, are superb writers and readers as well as admirers of Conrad. It so happens, that I can't bring myself to agree with them in their unabashed adoration of this particular novel, but it is a delightful rarity in the Amazonian jungle to find an entire page full of competent, well-penned reviews. Good show, all.Unfortunately, I simply can not dish up the same unbridled enthusiasm in my assessment of this work. The plot is positively a Victorian throwback in its contrivance, which leaves not a whit in its structure to chance: Damsel in distress rescued by old codger of a sea dog, but - Avast! - curmudgeonly ex-con father of said damsel throws spanner in the works, until, after a couple of fatalities aboard ship - with which the ever so honest sea dog of a Captain goes down, damsel, once again in distress, is saved by young second mate. And they lived happily ever after.... I must say that this rather laughable plot brought to mind watercolours of Victorian women hiding under parasols on Brighton beach flipping anxiously through the pages.Luckily, and not by chance at all, to save the book from absolute inanity, we have Conrad's persistent alter ego, Marlow, telling the tale, with his pointed aperus and contemplations regarding the human plight, complete with the nested narrations, all we've come to expect from the epic spinner of yarns, regaling us with the story.The book is not unenjoyable; it just doesn't rise to the high tide of great literature which Conrad's other novels do. But, if you're willing to suspend disbelief in the contrived, well-nigh Dickensian nature of the plot and be swept along by Marlow's ruminations, the book will provide what I believe is termed a \\"good read\\". For, as Marlow avers herein: \\"Luckily, people, whether mature or not (and who really is ever mature?) are for the most part quite incapable of understanding what is happening to them...\\"A good beach read by a writer whose best work lies further out in those unfathomable depths."},{"Title":"Chance: A tale in two parts","review":"Chance contains many of the themes found in Conrad's more critically acclaimed work: the role of womanhood in the Empire (HOD), the pressure of external events on personal relations, (The Secret Agent), the psychological struggle for dominance as well, often found in Conrad's shorter sea tales, but where Chance succeeds is in its narrative misdirection geared toward the reader. We at first assume that the novel will settle on some misadventure that is flashed back by Powell, and then we discover Marlow at the table, and discover it with a sinking feeling, and then get sucked into a series of narratives within narratives, a technique for which Modernism owes Conrad a great debt. We have the unnamed narrator who tries to contain Marlow, and Marlow who has to contain the Fynes, who have to contain Flora de Barral and her comically dim-witted father, whose narrow intelligence later becomes monstrous toward the novel's end; but this multi-layered technique is also the story's greatest weakness. Conrad weighs even minor characters down with a wee bit too much pressure: One expects a consequence from the second Mr. Powell and Flora's embittered governess, a consequence that never quite materializes given the effort Conrad puts into their backstories. It is mildly anti-climatic, and had it been shorter would have amounted to less labor for the amusingly frustrated spectators we are invited to be as Flora moves through her various stages of despair and then making terms with the world. The final picture we have of her, as a virtual goddess about to be united with the salt of the earth, relieves the burden the faithful reader carries along."},{"Title":"El Pequeno Monstruo De Las Casa","review":"It takes you back to the childhood and the understanding that a family is made up by individuals that you care about but each one has a different world they come from. very inspiring, Sweet and scary, tender and hard.

He tries to pass his book off as being unbiased, when in fact he is using the exact same bias found in the 17th and 18th centuries. He likens witchcraft to devil worship, likens to the pagan celebrations to sexual orgies and debauchery. Like the rest of the fools of his day, he got it wrong. Was there devil worship going on in his day? Most certainly there was. Fertility rituals for crops, healing the sick from natural medicines, and folk practices are not devil worship. The bible describes Lucifer (i.e the devil, satan) as a beautiful angel. The church, made by and run by man, created a foul image of the devil being half man and half beast, like many of the old pagan gods. The accounts of witchcraft found in this book are twisted and perverted to fit into the scope of devil worship. He makes hurdles of judgement, leaps to conclusions, and formulates opinions based on fiction. He seems to be determined to make witchcraft out to be evil, in fact seems determined to make anything other than catholicism out to be evil.Summers is a fool, just like his peers, and produced a \\"history\\" of witchcraft and demonology based on superstition and fear. Why a man of god uses the tools of the devil is beyond my realm of understanding.Don't waste your time reading this heap if you are interested in pre-christian religions. Don't read this heap if you are interested in demons. The only reason I would recommend reading this book is to see how christians view pagans and their religion.

Summers was well known for his many books on witchcraft, vampires, werewolves, and the history of the occult in general. He was generally considered The Expert on the history of witchcraft in the early 20th century and was filled with little-known anecdotal tales of witches, warlocks and dark devilish conspiracies as is evidenced by the many long dry examples in this book. This work is, however, a thorough reference on a arcane subject and is valuable for its many historical accounts of witch trials and other tales of witches, devils, and their arts. Summers is often criticized for his lack of skepticism, as noted below, as well as the heaps of praise he showers on the works of the Inquisition and its supposed war on witchcraft during the height of witch hysteria. His translations of notorious books like the Malleus Maleficarum and the Compendium Maleficarum, both witch hunting manuals used for centuries to detect, judge, and execute suspected witches, are his best-knwn works. Summers appears to revel in the age-old war against witches and often seemed a man born into the wrong time. He seems to wax nostalgic on the &quot;Burning Times&quot; and its blatant mysoginistic undertones, and this was in our &quot;modern&quot; age. In fact, he seems almost like a magistrate plucked from a 17th century witch burning and transplanted into the 20th century to write about his esteemed accomplishments! Yet, all this comes from a man who went to great lengths to transcribe and republish Reginald Scots' &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot;, a 16th century treatise DISCOUNTING the existence of witches and demons and which was banned by the Holy Office and ordered burned by King James I of England! Very interesting stuff indeed."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"One of the first, and still the best, scholarly studies of witchcraft, which deals in general terms with its history and practices (the companion volume The Geography of Witchcraft describes specific cases of witchcraft from around the world). Summers's baroque language is ideally suited to his subject, which is treated seriously, but with considerable wit. His inclination to believe too much rather than too little has not always found favour, but he wrote from the viewpoint of a Catholic priest who, though he relished describing the ways of the witch, also roundly condemned them."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"_The History of Witchcraft and Demonology_ by Roman Catholic priest Montague Summers provides a fascinating account of the influence of Satan on the development of witchcraft and heresy. Montague Summers, a convert to Catholicism, was an eccentric character - a priest who operated independently in England and wrote much on the occult and folklore from the perspective of a medieval traditionalist Roman Catholic. Summers argues against the so-called rationalists and skeptics who refuse to recognize the existence of the supernatural or the role of evil and of Satan in the world. Against these and other modernists, Summers provides the traditional Roman Catholic view regarding the demonic nature of heresy and the role of Satan in its proliferation.According to Summers, the witch is at once \\"heretic and anarchist\\". He seeks to show how all heresy, beginning with the dualistic Gnostic heresy including Manicheeism, is rooted in satanism and attempts to supplant the godly order of society and makes war against Christ and his Catholic Church. Among other heresies mentioned by Summers are those of the Waldensians, the Adamites, and the Cainites - Gnostics who spurned Christ and opted instead for the worship of Satan making an effort to identify with the sources of evil in Holy Scripture such as Cain and Judas Iscariot. Summers also mentions the Templars who became corrupted and engaged in vile acts including the worship of a human head known as the Baphomet. The witch, a devotee of Satan, may be understood as a revival of these most ancient and heinous heresies. Summers argues for the reality of witchcraft, claiming that there really existed a conspiracy against medieval society represented in witchcraft and that that conspiracy involved the worship of Satan, against the rationalists who attempt to explain it away through other means. Summers also argues against the theories of Margaret Murray, an anthropologist and Egyptologist who in her (in)famous book _The Witch-Cult in Western Europe_ argued that witchcraft represented a surviving pre-Christian pagan religion of Dianic worship which underlay medieval Christian society. Summers attempts to outline various features of the witch including the role of various demons and familiars, the witch's mark (believed to be an imprint left from the claw of Satan, and explaining the role of the \\"witch pricker\\"), the presence of a tiny nipple on the witch's body through which the familiar often in the form of a cat was nourished, and the role of the witch's sabbat. Summers also shows how the witch as Satanist sought to ape the Church of Christ, desecrate the host and religious objects, and engage in the black mass. Among others, Summers makes reference to such notorious criminals as Gilles de Rais (who engaged in the murder of children - another frequent accusation made against the witch) and the author J. K. Huysmans (whose novels feature Satanism and the black mass). Summers also turns his attention to the witch in Holy Writ. Here, he mentions the witch of Endor as well as bringing up such infamous injunctions against witchcraft as that in the Old Testament Exodus 22:18 \\"Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live.\\" In addition, Summers attempts to fully explain the phenomenon of diabolical possession. First, he notes the reality of diabolical possession and then he presents a discussion of the exorcism. Throughout he makes reference to Scripture, noting the exorcisms done by Christ himself and the apostles as well as from the history of the church and the lives of the saints. While the reality of the diabolical possession among those exorcised by Christ is de fide, some have argued that other exorcisms are more suspect (and others outside of the Catholic faith including Anglicans and other Protestants have rejected the practice entirely). Summers shows the errors in these rationalist and modernist explanations, and although it is possible that many were not in fact possessed, it is certainly the case that a great many were. In addition, Summers presents the entire Roman Ritual for exorcism. Summers also shows the use of exorcism among the Puritans, who often amateurishly attempted to copy the attempts of various Jesuits. Summers also explains spiritism (or spiritualism) in which a medium attempts to make contact with the dead or other discarnate spirits through various means. Summers shows the dangers of this and other occult beliefs presenting official documents from various church councils and popes. The church (and Summers) believe that much in spiritism can be explained as simply fraudulent practice; however, the fact remains that there is something diabolical at root behind spiritism and that often the spirits encountered in fact represent demons. Finally, Summers ends with a discussion of the witch in dramatic literature. Here, he presents details from various plays involving witchcraft including such famous examples as that of the Faust legend (presented in Goethe's _Faust_ and Marlowe's _Dr. Faustus_, for example) and in Shakespeare (especially the witches in _Macbeth_), etc.This book represents one of the best available on the history of witchcraft. Summers is obviously very learned and presents many obscure references, often in their original form (archaic English, French, Latin, or Greek), as well as stories from the lives of the saints, the history of the church, and Holy Scripture. Summers is unequivocally unapologetic for his rejection of modernism and thoroughly embraces the medieval viewpoint. He remains a fascinating and eccentric character whose books provide details on the occult of an encyclopedic scope."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"This is a textbook of witchcraft and demonology written by the Catholic priest that found the need to translate the \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" (the professional manual for witch hunters for nearly three centuries) into modern English.

Also, the chapters' &quot;The witch in holy writ&quot; and &quot;The witch in dramatic literature&quot; were not chapters I found of great interest. This book is best for being a collection of examples of accounts with devils and demons."},{"Title":"History of Witchcraft","review":"I stumbled over this book purely by accident. I had no idea that Summers is still in print. It is like finding a long-lost childhood friend!Back in the 1950s I used to hang with ceremonial sorcerers and the occasional black magician in my old home town of San Francisco. I was an avid collector of old coinage, you see, and my main source for Indian head pennies and Liberty dimes was a strange little shop in the Mission District run by an old geezer who was also a taxidermist. He claimed to be over 200 years old, his life preserved and extended by ingesting certain Lovecraftian \\"essences\\" from his stock in trade. Frankly, I didn't believe him; I'm sure he wasn't a day over 150.Anyway, the shop was the local gathering place for the questing brotherhood. After all, if you lived in San Francisco and your grimoire called for, say, a tablespoon of bat's blood, where on earth were you going to get it but from your friendly and slightly weird local taxidermist? Let me make it clear that I never met a sorcerer who was anything but respectable. The black magicians in particular were the most law-abiding of people. One would-be necromancer spent his days visiting and cheering up elderly residents in hospitals. The story that he was sizing up future clients was a vile canard. These were not the social misfits who took up Satanism as peddled by Anton LaVey and all his charlatan successors; they came much later. Really, the only questionable thing about the sorcerers I knew was a deplorable tendency of some to walk about the streets in cloaks.From time to time, one sorcerer or another would take the plunge and attempt to conjure up a demon. (The more namby-pamby among them would say \\"daimon,\\" but it was a distinction without a difference.) Real ceremonial magic is not for the unindustrious or slothful. There are robes to be embroidered, wands to be cut, blades to be forged, sigils to be drawn, flames to be lit, smokes to be inhaled and, believe it or not, prayers to be uttered. It is a long, intense, fatiguing process and, what the heck, it sometimes worked. It worked, that is, to the extent that an exhausted and half wigged-out sorcerer would convince himself that he had indeed called up a spirit from the vasty deep. And it would scare him silly. (In one of his books, Aleister Crowley gives a lengthy description of his shot at demon-raising and the absolutely predictable result.)After a bout of demonism, sorcerers would check in for short stays at convenient psychiatric facilities or, perhaps more likely, go on long benders. Then it was back to the taxidermy shop for sorcerous bull sessions about the esoteric literature then in print. (Grimoires, of course, were only valid in manuscript form and copies were held secret and unique to each individual sorcerer.) Eliphas Levi, the consensus held, was instructive but unsound in detail. Aleister Crowley was suggestive but ultimately incomprehensible--a delusion and a snare. Montague Summers was regarded as sound as to historical facts and crazy as a bedbug with regard to conclusions.

The plot and characters were very promising at first, but somewhere along the way they seemed lost and disjointed.The story starts off slow and you find yourself wondering when it will pick up, then when it does, it sputters and then fizzles out. I haven't read anything by this author and this is an old book(1994) so this author may have matured in her writing by now(2002), so I won't judge her. It just seems as though she wasn't sure and wasn't completely confident about her ability to write an in-depth story with factual information and a compelling look into life in England and Scotland in 1281.Some of the facts are obscure and we the reader are left with a simple shell of a tale about love and politics that leaves much to be desired.The author proves that she doesn't know a whole lot about this time period by writing an author's note stating that fact and how she had to add into account that the family she chose(Campbell) was a major key player in the Wars for Independence from 1296-1314.She also repeats herself throughout the book with phrases and thoughts from the main characters that seem to just fill up pages rather than add to the plot. My advice? Skip this one if you're in the mood for an exciting and fullfilling adventure through Scotland and England's wars with eath other.She was kidnapped right from under her father's nose and dragged to the untamed wilds of Scotland to be the hostage to the Laird of Clan Campbell. Lady Leonora Waltham didn't expect to fall in love with the barbarian in the process! How could she not? He was tall and rugged and he protected her.Dillon Campbell needed her as his hostage to make sure his brothers were returned unharmed.

David Jordan presents quite a different take on the self-styled \\"Incorruptible\\" and although he presents his case well, it's a familiar technique to make a bad guy look good. There's no doubt that the Thermidorians who were responsible for Robespierre's fall from power were as bad as he was and their hands were assuredly covered in blood. However, that certainly doesn't exonerate Robespierre for the outragous excesses that he and his committee were responible for. Robespierre was a man who's idealism ran amok and who lost sight of the reasons to have those ideas in the first place. His \\"ends justifying the means\\" mentality purposely and with great malice led France into the abyss in 1794 and the only way to reverse the trend was for his own quick and ruthless demise.The false historians who made Robespierre into the only monster of this time are certainly misleading and inaccurate. His contemporaries such as Danton, Hebert, Desmoulins and the rest were hypocrites and deservedly suffered the same fate as most in those days: the guillotine. Nonetheless, their devious behavior shouldn't cloud the fact that Robespierre was as guilty as the rest of them and responsible for many innocent deaths all in the name of his so-called virtue. David Jordan may be somewhat correct in his assessment that, at least early on, Robespierre acted merely for the people and was not interested in his own personal power. Unfortunately, as the Terror continued, Robespierre's magnanimous attitude diminished and was replaced by his ever-growing ego and paranoia. For all of Jordan's arguments regarding this man, one simple fact eludes him totally: the Great Terror ended with the execution of Robespierre and his followers. And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy."},{"Title":"THE REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE","review":"I came to this book knowing nothing, I walked away an erudite robespierriste. Jordan has written a clear, acessable history without being condescending. Although most of his interest is with Robespierre's politics and beliefs (plus an excellent chapter on his oratory), Jordan has a gift for including just enough personal information abou the Seagreen to make him seem at least somewhat human (for example: his obsessive love of oranges). I thoughroughly recomend it."},{"Title":"THE REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE","review":"One of the finest and most penetrating studies done on the French revolution as a whole and of Robespierre in particular. Too often readers only gleam their impressions of the period from Dickens and Thomas Carlyle.

It is so refreshing to read a thoughful, unprejudiced book rooted in facts. I can also highly recommend THE KING'S TRIAL by Jordan, one of the single best history books ever penned."},{"Title":"THE REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE","review":"With so much misinformation written about Robespierre, this scholarly volume is essentail for anyone who truly wishes to understand the most important figue of the French revolution. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE","review":"&lt;strong>BOOK REVIEWROBESPIERRE,David Warden, Harper Books, New York 2003 &lt;/strong>One of the enduring historical legends of the French Revolution is the tendency of historians and others to call the period of the reign of Robespierre, as the presiding genius of the Committee of Public Safety in 1793-94, the 'Reign of Terror'. That the domestic situation in France, and more especially its position in the bewildering status of European politics at the time, and the person of Robespierre himself were far more complex than that simple designation has only fairly recently become a decisive factor in historical studies of the revolution. The biography under review here is one example of the more reasoned approaches to the life and times of Robespierre. Although the author is clearly no admirer of Robespierre he is at least willing to give the devil his due, if only by comparison to the disastrous effects that later modern \`dictators' have had on history. For those, like this reviewer, who see the work of Robespierre, Saint Just and the other workaholic members of the Committee of Public Safety as critical to the lasting effects of the French Revolution, that is, as an embryonic attempt at a 'Republic of Virtue', this is all that one can ask for.The author organizes his book around several themes and does a more than adequate job of presenting the social, economic, philosophical, literary and legal positions that influenced Robespierre over his career. Especially interesting and previously unknown to me were the possible influences of freemasonry, illuminism and rosicrucianism on the thought and actions of Robespierre in the course of his struggle for power. At this histroical distance it is, however, hard to judge the true effect of such beliefs on his judgements. Let us just leave it that in revolutionary times the odd and eccentric get a hearing that they would not get in more stable times. Including by leaders who would ordinarily dismiss such ideas and persons.Professor Warden also traces Robespierre's career into the law as one of the routes that the self-made revolutionaries of the period saw as a stepping stone to power;his early literary and philosophical proclivities, particularly his devotion to Rousseau; his rise into the revolutionary leadership as the revolution moved left; his reputation as the \`incorruptible' man of personal virtue; his desire to create a reign of virtue; his personal mental and physical problems and their effect on his thoughts and actions; and, the inevitable controversy over the use of the death penalty and other repression laws to settle scores with real undying enemies and mere political opponents. This more well-rounded approach toward his life may not win Robespierre, an admittedly hard character to warm up to, more admiration. However, the approach has the virtue of at least changing the debate from one of the \`axis of evil' to one of a mainly rational approach to the problems confronting French in the early 1790's not the least of which was how to deal with real internal and foreign counterrevolutionary plots and military actions. Other, lesser, men of the times broke their teeth trying to solve those problems as well.One of the major points that I have tried to emphasize in my study of the French Revolution is the formation of the initial \`popular front' nature of the uprising and the subsequent breakup into its basic class components that has lessons for the situation in France and Western society today. For those who are unfamilar with the term- 'popular front', it is a poltical strategy that assumes the bulk of society have the same social and class interests. It is counterposed to the Marxian notion that the working class, independently, must lead society out of the morass that capitalism has put it in. In the France of 2007 that 'popular front' strategy is the favored one of the Socilist Party as it seeks the presidency of the Republic.The French Revolution as it moved left, a phenomena witnessed in all great revolutions, became less and less of a 'popular front', as we know it. Robespierre, it is clear, consciously made a decision to find support for his politics in the sans culottes masses of Paris. Others like Marat, the Hebertists and Babeuf also worked that same political vein. What makes Robespierre different from latter day revolutionaries like Marx, Lenin and Trotsky who like Robespierre were also not from the working classes was that he was driven by the revolution itself into his position in defense of the lower classes whereas the later mentioned revolutionaries were won to working class politics well before hand. That, among other things, may help explain why when Robespierre and his supporters were overthrown his support literally evaporated and the denigration of his reputation as a \`terrorist' began.Read this book for more insights on this question."},{"Title":"THE REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE","review":"This is perhaps the most really interesting biography of Robespierre yet written. It is a very fair treatment of a historical figure often misunderstood. Approaching Robespierre as a person who very consciously constructed himself is this book's strenth. Very smart and very readable."},{"Title":"THE REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE","review":"Even if this biography of Robespierre is more nuanced than many, it is still written in the critical tradition of studies on the man. While Jordan writes in a manner that does rely on facts (unlike many other, especially past, historians), he tends to put the worst construction on any actions of Robespierre's, and doesn't give him a chance. As I have found to be the case with most English-language biographies of Robespierre, his view of Robespierre and the other revolutionaries can only properly be described as condescending; refusing to seriously consider the circumstances of the times, he judges the actions of the revolutionaries not in context, but with the hindsight of the 20th century.Jordan clearly brings his prejudices with him in the writing of the book; despite having looked at the facts he still remains mired in the close-minded Anglo-American mindset in which works like the Scarlet Pimpernel have long thrived. Perhaps his views may best be described by the first paragraph of his essay from the collection of essays, Robespierre, edited by Colin Haydon and William Doyle, in which he describes Robespierre as \\"unworldly, resentful, vain, egotistical, susceptible to flattery, contemptuous of or indifferent to all the social pleasures except conversation, guarded and suspicious... inflexible, unforgiving, ill at ease in public, secretive, stiff and pedantic as a speaker (with an unpleasing and not very powerful voice), lacking the common touch, preoccupied... annoyingly fastidious, adroit and closely focused rather than original, prone to substitute Jacobin rhetorical formulae for logical steps, obsessively self-regarding... etc.\\" He refuses to give credit where credit is due (but for a passage in which he grudgingly admits that Robespierre was not bloodthirsty, but takes every possible opportunity to snipe at the historical figure's character.That said, The Revolutionary Career of Maximilien Robespierre is well-written and an interesting and informative read.

It is disturbingthat so many readers of this book expressing their views in ... praisethis idealized biography, once again reinterpreting the career of thisauthoritarian despot, who systematically guillotined those who did notshare his sterile, cold-as-steel view of the world. Jordan's versionof Robespierre's biography is a slanted, utopian vision of the world,according to L'Incorruptible, Robespierre, judging him by his writingsrather than by his well known treacherous and sanguinary deeds and thetoll they took on France from 1789-1794, particularly1793-1794.This is accomplished because Robespierre has been judgedby the author by his lofty-sounding words and &quot;noble&quot; idealsexpressed in his writings and his expressed intention to transform theancien r&eacute;gime into the Republic of Virtue. The fact that Robespierre,the Incorruptible, the &quot;Representative of the People,&quot;helped demolish the ancien r&eacute;gime, through unspeakable violence onlyto bring misery and suffering and the blood and horror of the Reign ofTerror, is not directly addressed.Jordan writes: &quot;I have nothere attempted a biography of Robespierre but have written perhaps aspecies of biography, intellectual biography. I have laid heavy stresson his words&quot; [Emphasis added; p. 10].By this appraisal,Jordan admits he relies on Robespierre written words, rather than thetyrant's personal influence or his overt or covert actions in theFrench Revolution. In doing so, he has written about an idealizedFrench Revolution, which, like Plato's Republic, is depicted the wayit should have been, and not, like Aristotle observed, the world as itreally was.Jordan thus admits, &quot;I have, as one must whendealing with evidence of a literary kind, taken Robespierre at hisword.&quot; So in effect, the Voice of Virtue of Robespierre'scollective works, Oeuvres compl&egrave;tes, speaks through the author to thereader --- just the way Robespierre wanted to be heard down the agesof history, as opposed to what he actually did (i.e., commissions aswell as omissions), intrigued, and plotted, as the center figure ofthe French Revolution. What Robespierre actually did or did not do isimportant because even though he presided over the Reign of Terror,Robespierre also contributed significantly in driving the Revolutiondown the path of radicalism and violence, in the preceding years(1789-1793).Jordan, like many present day academicians with apenchant for collectivism and egalitarianism (with the concomitant andnecessary authoritarianism that is necessary to achieve the&quot;lofty&quot; goals of a forced equality), is enamored ofRobespierre, his regimented vision of the world and the leveling ofsociety at any cost. This requires the adoption of Robespierre's ownintellectual views and the author's revised vision of the FrenchRevolution.Jordan explains, &quot;What we forget is thatRobespierre was a man transformed, purified in the heat of theRevolution, which melted away the old flesh to expose the newspirit. His was a destiny rather than a life&quot; (pg.8). Alas, itseems the author is trying to achieve the apotheosis of a tyrant!Thus, Jordan's book is a literary interpretation that disguises andfails to explain what actually took place; the author, intentionallyor not, ends up attempting to ameliorate the excesses and justifyRobespierre and his legacy of authoritarianism and terror.AlthoughJordan hints at conceding a certain amount of hypocrisy on the part ofRobespierre, he quickly dismisses it, as the narrative unfolds,usually quoting Robespierre's own explanation for theseshortcomings. Thus, he mentions that during the so-called&quot;Reactionary&quot; period - i.e., from the autumn of 1791 tothe summer of 1792 - Robespierre was plagued by vacillations,&quot;sophistry,&quot; and &quot;contradictions.&quot; For example,late during this period, Robespierre called himself the Defender ofthe Constitution and so named his newspaper La D&eacute;fenseur de laConstitution; this, in itself, could not be more hypocritical. Theconstitution that Robespierre was purportedly defending was theConstitution of 1791 that had established a Constitutional Monarchyfor France in which the king possessed a powerful veto over thelegislature (the Legislative Assembly). This constitution, whichRobespierre purported to defend, he truly despised, only that he usedit to wrap himself with it, seeking legalisms and protection. The factis Robespierre, the &quot;Representative of the People,&quot; wascowed and trembling during the &quot;Reactionary&quot;period...With the fall of Robespierre, it was the end of theTerror. Robespierre and his henchmen, his brother Augustin, St. Just,Couthon and Hanriot went to the guillotine. Le Bas shot himself todeath at the Htel de Ville. The story is much better told by OttoScot in Robespierre: The Voice of Reason (1974; the newer edition isRobespierre: The Fool as Revolutionary [1995]) and by Stanley Loomis,Paris in the Terror (1964; 1989). (See my reviews ... and orderyourself copies.)Jordan, to his credit, has written a literarybiography in which he has obviously done a great deal of work. It isremarkable that he admitted, &quot;I have asked the reader to view theFrench Revolution through the consciousness of Robespierre. I havepresented Robespierre's Revolution which is not identical with that asseen by others who lived it, nor with the Revolution now seen byhistorians&quot; (p. 238).Unfortunately, Jordan's caveat is likelyto be lost within the content of his book and his concerted defense ofL'Incorruptible. There are much better books. Nevertheless, this bookwill add to the vast amount of knowledge helping us understand themindset of those would-be leaders of men who, not content with runningtheir own affairs, wish to impose their own warped, nightmarish visionof failed utopias, upon the rest of us.

Nappa employs delightful, tongue-in-cheek scenarios to illustrate some of the main points, such as The Chocolate Touch and Naomi's Diary.Nappa explores the many ways a woman's actions can leave marks on the lives of loved ones, friends, and strangers. She challenges women to recognize the permanent record of their own prints left behind through actions, words and touching. Are your prints leaving a bruise or are they lifting people to God's higher touch? Does your touch cause pain in someone's life or does it promote healing?The book consists of ten chapters, each divided into short sections illustrating the different types of touches a woman may experience either through her own actions or the actions of others:* Your Fingerprints Are All Over the Place! - The Mark of a Woman's Touch* He Touched Me - God's Touch on Your Life* The Touch Treatment - Helping the Hurting* As Good as New - The Touch of Restoration* A Gentle Touch - The Soft Caress of God's Love* Home, Sweet Home - Touching Your Family* Won't You Be My Neighbor? - Touching Your Community* The Hands of God - Touching in and through Your Church* Touch and Go - Random Touches Both Near and Far* I'm Touched - Touching Your Own HeartThis book encourages women to discover their spiritual gifts and offers advice on how to find out what those gifts really are. Spiritual gifts, when used wisely, can oftentimes guide women to leave their very best fingerprints behind.Included in \\"A Woman's Touch\\" are lists of activities which may inspire women of all ages to begin leaving lasting, encouraging fingerprints that leave hope in lives, such as: Mentoring, gift-wrapping, house-cleaning, even changing the oil for single mothers.Throughout the book, readers are introduced to real-life women who have left, or who are leaving, permanent fingerprints of kindness in the lives of others. Nappa uses short vignettes of the lives of these women to illustrate her points.Each chapter begins with a memorable quote and ends with a short prayer which is accompanied by an applicable bible verse to remember.Nappa concludes with a section that reminds women to finally touch their own hearts.This book is recommended for several uses: Women's Group Leaders, Young Women's Groups, a study guide for women and as a basis for a series of sermons directed at women. However, pastors should not hesitate to use \\"A Woman's Touch\\"when teaching men. Many of the principles involved can be applied to either sex.\\"A Woman's Touch\\" is easily readable and appealing to women aged 16 and older, and would make a wonderful 16th birthday gift for all young women."},{"Title":"A Woman's Touch","review":"There were some good points but I didn't keep this book after I was done reading it."},{"Title":"No Higher Honor: The U.S.S.

He describes the innocense of the young sailors, the shock of the enemy attacks, the death and destruction, the patriotism, spirit and camaraderie among the crew of the Yorktown and of course their enormous courage. For anyone who is a student of WW II this is a must read. The book gave me a glimpse of the horrors my father witnessed as the Junior Medical Officer on the Yorktown during the Battle of the Coral Sea and at Midway. Along with the others in the medical department he saw the worst of what war can do to a human being. He did not often speak of his Navy service during the Battle of Midway. In the few times he did, he expressed the greatest respect and praise for the brave pilots whose each flight meant a chance with death, for the enlisted men whose duty it was to stand with their shipmates firing their anti-aircraft guns as the attacking enemy planes bore down on them and for the officers whose decisions during the battle meant life or death for scores of men. If understanding war, how it defines a man and what courage is, then read this book.

I was particularly interested by the personal stories and experiences of the crew members. I do feel that the book did not devote enough time to the battle of Midway. There are only about 120 pages or so that actually deal with the battle, while the rest of the book covers the Yorktown's earlier service, hence the &quot;confusing title&quot;.

Just a few corrections: some US torpedo planes DID return to their carriers; Geo. Gay of VT-8 did NOT receive the Medal of Honor; SBD and TBD armament is incorrectly described; and for some vague reason the Yorktown dive bombing attack that sank the Japanese carrier Soryu is glossed over in one short paragraph.

The author's discussion of some of the thousands of crewmembers and their stories is natural and gives a reader enough of an appreciation for each to make the full story that much more urgent as events unfold.The discussion of luck, fate, duty and honor shared between the carrier Yorktown and her crew is also especially recommended for school-age students that need resource material or some kind of understanding about what is increasingly getting littler amounts of ink in high school history courses. I would urge that this be used in school libraries and recommended for readers seeking to learn about the difficulties that come from conflict and their human costs. By the end of the book, readers will definitely have a much greater appreciation for the challenges that came from service, the sacrifices stemming from war, and the humanity that bound the whole thing together."},{"Title":"No Higher Honor: The U.S.S. Yorktown and the Battle of Midway","review":"\`No Higher Honor: The U.S.S. Yorktown at the Battle of Midway' by Jeff Nesmith is a insightful account of the men who made up the crew of the US aircraft carrier \`Yorktown' at the Battle of Midway. As one of the previous reviews has mentioned the title may be a bit misleading as the book really starts before America's entry into World War Two. But that is fine as the author gives you an idea of some of the characters of this story, he gives you a real look at the ordinary men who served on this ship. We hear stories from some of the ships crew, from pilots and the aircraft handlers and from some of the officers.The narrative is easy to read and the personal accounts fit right into the flow of the book. I could really picture the story and the people; the author's style of writing put you right there. I was sadden by some of what I read, of the men who lost their lives during the fighting at Midway, of friends lost and bravery unseen and un-rewarded. This is a great story, maybe not the best book on a tactical/strategic level but one of the best covering the human element of war. The book has a number of black and white photographs many previously not seen before. Overall this is a good story and I think most people who enjoy a well-written history book will enjoy this account of a fine ship during a great battle of WW2."},{"Title":"I Will Lie Down This Night (Prayerbooks)","review":"This book provides an excellent illustration of how night prayer a.k.a. compline speaks to our everyday life. It does so in contemporary spiritual terms, e.g. several quotes are Celtic or sound Celtic, while building an understanding of a very traditional prayer. The illustrations and the layout of the book complement the content.The chapters discuss nighttime rituals and fear, the oral nature of contact in darkness, the need for companionship, facing the &quot;naked&quot; truth, sheltering, blessing, waiting in hope - each discussed in terms of the every day experiences of raising a child (or being raised). This experience is interwoven with a parallel understanding of the words and attitudes of night prayer.The final section provides materials for night prayer, a variation on the formal liturgical form. It consists of: 1) a choice of two opening prayers 2) quiet reflection 3) a choice of two pentitential prayers 4) a choice of five psalms or canticles 5) a hymn (the one mistep on production - not making the breaks between the hymns obvious) 6) a Marian invocation 7) a choice of three closing prayers.Many of the texts of the night prayer were used within the chapters introducing the concepts of night prayer. The night prayer has been shortened, simplified and rearranged, but the various parts are very traditional. The format for night prayer given here has distinct advantages - (1)the parts are unchanging except by personal choice giving the ready possibility of memorizing and internalizing the prayers (2) the prayer is short enough to fit easily into one schedule so it can actually be prayed rather than remaining good intentions (3) the choices fit well within the context of the book so that choices are limited to psalms/canticles which one can easily relate to one's own day.Highly recommended as a viable introduction to praying the psalms."},{"Title":"Groundswell: Stories of Saving Places, Finding Community","review":"Groundswell provides a deep and broad picture of what can be done to improve a variety of communities by bringing nature back into everyday lives--not by simply visiting nature, but by incorporating the natural elements that are already there, waiting to be reclaimed, restored, and celebrated by entire communities. What's so fascinating in this book is that Hopkins lays out, in engaging stories, exactly how these changes have actually come about, emphasizing the hard work, persistence, passion, and compromise required. In the back is an invaluable guide to setting goals, working with other organizations, and all that's needed to get these difficult projects along the road to success in your own community.I'm not involved in community planning, just an ordinary citizen, but after reading this book, I look at my own city (Baltimore) differently. Now I can recognize the efforts that organizers and volunteers have endured to make greenways and other urban improvements that have been so hard-won.The book is also inspiring for any sort of endeavor. It shows what hard work and passion can achieve. The specific examples--from Maine, Wisconsin, Montana, North Carolina, Washington State, and most astonishingly, The Bronx--are fascinating both in their specifics and in their larger lessons."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is amazing, I enjoy the first half more in which Viktor E. Frankl focuses on his experience in the holocaust camps. Very well-written and analyzed. Definitely a book someone should pick up."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of my favorites. Someone lent it to me, and me not knowing what it was about at the time, I read it on the train ride to visit Auschwitz in Poland while I was touring Europe. Quite a coincidence there!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl's story and theory of practice in the world of psychology is fascinating. Few people have survived the circumstances he endured and are able to not only describe it, but put his proven postulations into practice."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Great book, I recommend to anyone, any age. Excellent book to read for historical and/or leisure purpose. Thank you for recommendation by others."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a very intimate look at the life of a Holocaust survivor. It has lots of insights that are usually overlooked.The book came on time in perfect condition, the seller was great.Thank you."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm not sure what brought Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning in my hands on Rosh Hashanah . Maybe it is the \\"meta\\" feeling of the High Holiday. The High Holidays can be a letdown. The liturgy, the long hours in the synagogue, the archaic and sometimes alienating images of a God who is King (and male) who rewards and punishes, who inscribes people in book of life or a book of death. All these concepts can be profound (after all, what else is more important than life and death) but also difficult to grasp, even in ten days, even with all one's strength and attention.So, Frankl's book on \\"existential\\" psychology probably acted as a counterweight to grand theories of life and death. By definition, existentialism tries to avoid overarching \\"meaning\\" systems. For Frankl, a survivor of the Nazi death camps, there is only the moment, and how we frame the meaning of that moment. Frankl's book gives numerous examples of how this is done, and that is the meat of the book. Toward the end, there are silly sections about the therapeutic school he founded based on these insights, replete with technical jargon that sounds outdated and odd.But that is not the lesson we should take away from Man's Search for Meaning. Finding meaning, God, self, love, are ongoing activities, happening at every single moment. It never ends. When we stop trying to find a meaning in each moment, we fall into a torpor which is a kind of death."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'd heard Man's Search for Meaning and author Viktor Frankl referenced many times over the past few years. I decided in 2010 to finally read this. Was I glad I did. It is by far one of the most riveting stories of the power of the human mind and spirit. I've since re-read this 2 more times in the past 12 months.His theory that there are only 2 \\"races\\" of men on earth is intriguing. He asserts there are only \\"decent\\" men and \\"indecent\\" men. He states every society has both. The thought that there were \\"decent\\" Nazi guards in the camps and likewise \\"indecent\\" prisoners is interesting and he brings the point home so very well.I believe this book has been deemed, by the Library of Congress, one of the 10 most influential books ever written. You owe it to yourself to check it out."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"could not read the first part where the man was in a concentration camp. I lived thru the 40's hearing about them and did not want to revisit those memories. Very deep, lots of words I don't understand. I will donate to the library."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Most people have suffered to some degree, either in the past or they will most likely experience something undesirable in the future. A book like this could literally be a life-safer and improve your life for absolute better.I cannot believe it took so many years before I discovered such an fantastic book regarding self-improvement and how to overcome tragic events in such a helpful way like presented in the book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I couldn't give a more glowing recommendation for a printed work than this courageous account and subsequent analysis on the true meaning of life. I expected an intelligent self-help type book; what I read was the most life changing, inspiring work (besides the Bible) I have ever set eyes on. I recommend it to anyone, especially those who feel something is missing in their life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's book was pretty interesting. Makes one realize that our own trouble are not so bad after all. I read this book for a class I was taking this past semester. I pretty much found this information similar to the observations and ideas from the book called \\"The Secret\\". The way a person sees and thinks about things is how his life will develop. Your body will not be at ease if you are focusing on just the negative aspects of life. Make good choices."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning lays the foundation for all of his other works as well as for his brand of psychotherapy, Logotherapy. For me it was one of those books which influenced my life forever and a book I go back to and read again. Based on Frankl's own experiences in Hitler's death camps and on the blackness of the Holocaust in general, it offers hope. It would be hard to read this book without changing one's life for the better. Frankl was a psychiatrist, but he was also a man who suffered deeply and turned that suffering into something positive.Elisabeth Skoglund, author of Divine Recycling"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I bought this book for a friend. I've read the book long ago myself. This is the kind of book that improves one's mind and prepares one for the future.

This is one of those books.The testimony part is awesome, leaves little chance to argue that a life full of suffering shouldn't be lived. The logotherapy introduction part is very interesting and enlightening, although I had some bumps with the technical stuff, but that's nothing that google can't handle :)Buy it, read it and share it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very interesting account of one man's experience in a concentration camp. Sans the detailed horror and gore of other WWII stories, Frankl gives a compassionate telling of his experiences and examines man's choice in how he reacts to life's many diffulties. He also introduces the reader to logotherapy, which he developed as a result of his WWII years. Logotherapy states that the root of depression and discontent is the person's lack of meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first read this book when I was thirteen years old. I understood the main idea of this book to be--your attitude is the most important concept for living life. Through the years I have read this book several times and I have always gained renewed hope from reading it. Whether in therapy, recovery or daily life, I have found that my attitude does determine the kind of life I live. This book reminds me of the truth."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning changed my life for better by giving a compassionate view of our shared struggles to understand and overcome the evil we are willing to do to each other.The first part of the book is a straight forward narrative of Viktor Frankl's years in various concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Frankl was a neurosurgeon and psychiatrist whose insights into the experience of grotesque devaluation of life are priceless.The second part of the book are the beginning observations that lead to developing a new psychological school, \\"Logotherapy\\".Cherishing this book, I bought this copy for a lifer in the \\"hole\\" in prison. He reports that it has calmed him down a great deal. Hopefully he will find a meaning to his life..."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"My therapist recommended this for me to read.

I he can find a meaning in all his suffering to live and go on and be happy...then any one can. Thia book can give hope to the hopeless."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is often referenced and worth reading. Viktor lived a life that's difficult to imagine. His lessons are worth your attention. Here are several of his inspiring quotes:\\"Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.\\"\\"What is to give light must endure burning.\\"\\"The last of the human freedoms is to choose one's attitudes.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"of the therapeutic model toward the future, and conscious, purposeful living.

What inspired me most was that Victor Frankl could have left Austria but chose to stay as he didnt want to leave his elderly parents. He had written a book prior to his capture but of course was destroyed during his captivity. But what a better book he no doubt wrote following. This book highlights the belief \\"every stressful situation is an opportunity\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I completed Man's search for meaning in a single reading which lasted til 4:30 in the morning. I could not set it down. Frankl provides highly skilled professional observations and in depth analysis of the behavioral characteristics of humans under the most stressful and violent conditions of human existence-as prisoners in the Nazi concentration camps. Frankl describes why Man's Search for Meaning is so important to survival And emphasizes that personal responsibility, hard work and discipline is needed for the successful search for ones meaning.The book provides a deeper understanding of the human degradation and human tradegy faced by the prisoners of the of the Nazi concentration camps.Man's Search for Meaning has independent value, is a very well written, important book, unique in its approach and necessary to one's understaning of the psychological basis of survival."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Recommend this book to everyone.
