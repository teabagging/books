I have, therefore, purchased several books and tutorial DVDs on the subject and am working my way through them all. The title of this product suggests it is the right place to start and, on reflection, is exactly where I should have started. For those of you, who like me, are converting to digital for the first time, grab your camera and a copy of this book and work your way through from cover to cover until you are conversant with the new technology. It really will give you a good grounding.That, however, will only work very well if you are already conversant with photography. If you are new to photography altogether and a digital SLR camera is your very first camera, you may have to learn a few basic lessons of, for example, the correlation between film speeds, shutter speeds and aperture settings - which really do need to be understood, before you study this book.David Busch clearly knows what he is talking about and is able to put that knowledge into an easy-to-follow format for us Dummies to read and, as I say, I wish I had read this book before getting into some of the more technical tomes I also purchased.NM"},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I read \\"Exposure for Dummies\\" and found it very helpful. This book was by a different author but I thought it might be of same quality as the Exposure book. Unfortunately, it's wasn't. Anyone that has ever owned a camera probably already knows the basics that this book has to offer. When the book goes beyond the basics, it merely mentions more advanced features without a helpful explanation of why the photographer might want to use them. And it is repetitive, as if the author had a page requirement to fill. There were a few bright spots, but on the whole, the basics were too basic, and the advanced features, too poorly covered to be of any help to anyone that isn't already familiar with them. There are better books for beginners, and for intermediate photographers, this book has little to offer."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I'm completely new to cameras, whether SLR, film, or digital. So I was hoping for something I could read that would really help be build a foundation without having to spend hours and hours cluelessly playing around, hoping for epiphanies.The Cons:1. I can understand how someone who has shot film for a long time might be disappointed in the book, because it seemed to me a lot of the content was photography-centric, not digital-photography-centric. Though usually with dSLR slant.2. Nothing is ever covered in depth. But hey, it's a Dummies book, it's a primer for the rest of your adventures.3. I would really have liked to see some tables in there to help with shutter-speeds/f-stops their combinations and effects. I learned a lot, but I am still struggling with f-stops in particular.The Pros1. It is simply amazing how many different facets of the photo world (digital or otherwise) are touched.2. The book does a great job of highlighting all the different tools new people like myself would not really understand, like the differences between file types (JPEG/RAW/TIFF) or filters, and giving you enough information to get started without going overboard.3. Constantly discussing the differences in grades of equipment, from what a new person would need compared to a professional is very useful. The discussion of what you're getting for your extra dollars between that $100 tripod and the $500 tripod is really helpful when you're just starting and scratching your head going \\"Isn't a tripod a tripod?\\".4. The flow of the book is excellent. You never delve too deeply into a concept nor do you ever really just skip right off the top.5. There are even a number of goodies in here including websites the author finds useful (which helps given the 1,000 of sites out there) and even how to create your own filters (I'm looking forward to creating a pinhole filter)****Bottom-lining it - If you're switching from film to digital, there will be large chunks that you will already know, so you may want to search for a book that specifically discusses the differences between film and digital.If you're completely new to photography and your first camera is a dSLR, this is a great book. I would recommend it in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"This is the second edition regarding digiral photography I've purchased.

I'm a beginner with digital cameras so this was all I needed to get me started."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"I'm pretty much new to the DSLR world, in fact, after reading this book I realized I didn't really know much at all about cameras in general. This book gave me a great introduction into how DSLR's work, all the proper terms I should know, and showed techniques on improving my photography.I could see how this book can kind of drag on for the more experienced photographers, since it does go over a lot of topics. But as a newbie to this area, I greatly appreciated all the information.Some other things: The author does seem to go out of his way to say that DSLR's are vastly superior to Point and Shoot's. Yes, I get it, DSLR's take a greater quality picture and also gives you more control; however, a DSLR won't fit in your pants pocket.Also, I wish I read this book BEFORE I bought my camera as the beginning of the book tells you what to look for when buying a camera. So if you haven't purchased your first DSLR and are new to serious photography, I would have to say to buy this book before you choose a camera.Some of the things I liked:An explanation of all the lens and other accessories that might be useful to you.All the advice on shooting... pictures.The author's serious but not too serious tone. He also offered a realistic perspective on what to do in certain situations.Post-processing advice."},{"Title":"Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies","review":"Having recently gotten my first digital SLR, I thought \\"Digital SLR Cameras and Photography for Dummies\\" would be perfect for teaching me the basics of the digital SLR camera. I was right.For those familiar with the \\"Dummies\\" series of books, the layout of \\"Digital SLR Cameras and Photography for Dummies\\" (I'll just call it the \\"book\\" from here on as the title is a bit long) will be very familiar. Useful tips and other notes can be found in the margins for quick reference. Even the ever-popular cheat sheet is included inside the front cover.What I like about this book is that it covers everything from what the acronym \\"SLR\\" stands for (single lens reflex) to chromatic aberration (a discoloring issue). The digital SLR provides more creative freedom than a point-and-shoot camera does, and the book tells you exactly how to take advantage of these freedoms.It would seem difficult to write a useful book about digital SLRs, since there are several models and brands out there. The book avoids this issue by discussing the functions of digital SLRs, which are pretty much the same across the board, and not necessarily which button does what. Although there is some of that too. Whether you're a Canon person or a Nikon person or other, you'll get the point.A book with the word \\"Photography\\" in the title would seem to imply that there are plenty of photos inside, and that is true of this book. They are usefully tied to the concepts that the book discusses. When exposure is discussed, photos showing under, over and just-right exposure help explain what the text is saying.This book is not just for digital SLR newbies. Many people that have digital SLRs may only use a fraction of the features that their cameras offer. For those folks, this book can open up more ways for them to use their cameras. For newbies, the benefits of reading this book are obvious.I'm a fan of the \\"Dummies\\" books (which perhaps says something about me) and \\"Digital SLR Cameras and Photography\\" for Dummies did not disappoint. It is a must-read for anyone that is considering buying a digital SLR as well as new owners. All but the most experienced digital SLR users will find some benefit to reading \\"Digital SLR Cameras and Photography for Dummies.\\""},{"Title":"The collected poems of James Elroy Flecker,","review":"Flecker was a British poet who died young but still managed to produce a brilliant collection of poems which are almost totally unknown among Americans. He is one of my favorite poets. He was a friend of Lawrence of Arabia and it is with Arabia that he is identified -- not the real Arabia, but a fantasy Arabia that was the locale of a play called Hassan, which was produced with music by Delius. At his best he is wonderful -- &quot;the dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea&quot;! One of his finest achievements was to write two poems, &quot;Pillage&quot; and &quot;The War-song of the Saracens&quot;, which present the same situation from the viewpoints of the conquerors and the conquered, both poems being in the same metrical structure, but the first one being languid and the other one energetic."},{"Title":"The collected poems of James Elroy Flecker,","review":"This book is a reprint, page for page, image for image, of the 1916 edition of \\"The Collected Poems of James Elroy Flecker.\\" After the horrible looking, grey blob photograph of Flecker, the rest of the book is thankfully legible, except for a poem or two where the first letter of each line is cut off/cut in half. But these negatives do not detract much from the book as a whole.As it is with many other volumes of \\"Collected Poems\\", so this book contains some ok efforts and then there are some truly excellent poems, all mixed together. There is some humour, some exoticism (of the \\"Parnassian\\" school), some fine examples of pure Georgian verse, but I find that Flecker is at his best when he chooses as his subject a kind of \\"Arabian Nights\\" style orientalism (Note: Flecker was a friend of T.E. Lawrence \\"of Arabia\\"); which sometimes means quaint verse-dialogue retellings of biblical tales, and which at other, better times means narrative poems such as the acknowledged classic \\"Golden Journey to Samarkand\\" (unfortunately not finished during the author's brief lifetime).Included also are poems that take the reader on stranger, less familiar journeys to dark places. Flecker's translation of a part of Virgil's Aeneid in which the characters descend into a terrifying depiction of Dis (the Roman hell) is awesome, as are his other efforts, such as following example:\\"The Second Sonnet of Bathrolaire\\"Now the sweet Dawn on brighter fields afarHas walked among the daisies, and has breathedThe glory of the mountain winds, and sheathedThe stubborn sword of Night's last-shining star.In Bathrolaire when Day's old doors unbarThe motley mask, fantastically wreathed,Pass through a strong portcullis brazen teethed,And enter glowing mines of cinnabar.Stupendous prisons shut them out from day,Gratings and caves and rayless catacombs,And the unrelenting rack and tourniquetGrind death in cells where jetting gaslight gloams,And iron ladders stretching far awayDive to the depths of those eternal domes.-It is unfortunate that Flecker died of tuberculosis when he was just hitting his stride as a talented writer. Had he lived longer, I am sure he would have been lauded as one of the great English poets, as renowned as Keats or Milton, or other English poets whose work I don't enjoy nearly as much as I enjoy Flecker's. Readers who enjoy James E. Flecker's poetry may also enjoy the poems of American author Robert E. Howard (1906-36), who named Flecker as one of his major influences."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"In his second novel Jim Brown proves that he is one of the most unique voices in suspense fiction today. His plots are fresh, his twist incredible and his sense of pacing and intrigue second to none.Here's the premise: a seventeen year old terror with shocking white hair named Whitey Dobbs is buried alive as part of a gang initiation. His coffin includes an air tank and a radio. Half way into his allotted time there is a news bulletin. The four boys who just buried Dobbs (and the only ones who know where he is) have just been killed in a car accident.It literally gave me goose-bumps.Then we meet the fifth member of the group a smart, sensitive kid named Dean Truman. We learn along with Dean that it's all a trick. The four (who are very much alive) have faked the broadcast hoping to terrify Whitey Dobbs who they believed attacked one of the boy's sister.But Dean's says that's impossible since the girl was with him at the time. Oops. The boys rush to the grave site and frantically start digging. But when they open the coffin it's empty. Whitey Dobbs is gone.Flash forward twenty years to the present. The four boys have all become successful in their hometown of Black Valley, Oregon. None more so than Dean who has just won a Nobel Prize.Then the killing starts. An impossible series of murders that include a storm of glass and strangulation by a severed hand. But most shocking of all is the growing evidence that seems to suggest Whitey Dobbs is back and he hasn't aged a day.An award wining broadcast journalist Brown wrote about reality TV in his first book, the scorching nail-bitter 24/7. In Black Valley he displays a remarkable flexibility that shows he's not tethered to the TV premise. What next? The only thing I know for sure is whatever he writes I want to read."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"Over two decades ago, five Black Valley, Oregon teens buried a still living Whitey Dobbs in the allegedly haunted Hawkins Hill. The quintet feel justice has been served, as the maniacal sadistic Dobbs was very quick to use a switchblade on anyone. Unbeknownst to the group is Dobbs avoided certain death due to radioactivity that turned him into an immortal and allowed him to travel back and forth through time.Dobbs visits Black Valley intent on killing his enemies one at a time. Feeling no remorse, Dobbs methodically carves up four of his foes and anyone else who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Only Nobel Prize winning scientist Dean Truman remains, but he is also the most difficult of the prey as he begins to understand how Dobbs survived his interment and how he can vanish at will. Dean's peer, Piper Blackmoore, joins forces with him in an effort to defeat permanently the slippery Dobbs.BLACK VALLEY is a supernatural serial killer thriller that seems to go just over the edge with one unbelievable twist after another, but readers will relish suspending belief because the terror seems so real due to the reactions of the victims. Dobbs is almost a comic book character and has been seen in some form of personification (Krueger?) in movies and books often, but Jim Brown never allows him to go too far while managing to make him an original. His opponents add to his aura. The audience will applaud Mr. Brown for this non-stop preternatural action thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"BLACK VALLEY starts off reminiscent of some of the earlier works of Stephen King, Dean Koontz and Dan Simmons. Adolescent pranks instigate revenge and so on when they become adults. The opening sequence involving the initiation rites for nasty Whitey Dobbs is tense, chilling and quite well done.Once the boys grow up, though, it becomes a Twilight Zonish nightmare, with Whitey obviously out for some nasty revenge. Dobbs' character is effectively nasty, and the heroics of Piper Blackmoore and Dean Truman are appropriately chivalrous. However, by the time we realize what's happening, Brown falls into the trap of trying to explain time travel, and gets lost in his own revelations. But taken as a sci-fi creepfest, it works and Brown does well with developing his characters and the frightening scenarios. Brown's second novel is actually a little better than 24/7, and I think once he finds his &quot;voice,&quot; he'll be a better writer."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"A gave this book a four because of the first 3/4 of it which ws a lot like a Dean Koontz book. After that it changed gears so drastically I got whiplash. It also got far too technical, info overload!"},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"I got about 100 pages into this amatuerish effort and frankly gave up. Just in case I was wrong about this, I skipped forward a few times, and sure enough, it was more of the same insipid, unimaginative, juvenile writing style. What a disappointment, after 24/7! The characters are so obvious, with such gratuitous identities, that they appear plastic and one dimensional. This was overcome in 24/7 by a fast moving, intelligent plot, but no such luck here. Here, I'm afraid, the lack of substance is glaring. This could have been worth reading, but was apparently rushed in order to take advantage of the success of 24/7. Wouldn't it be nice if agents and publishers gave the muse a little more room."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"I'm not a big thriller reader, but this book looked really good, and it was...until about 3/4 the way through.

Aside from the end...it was a great page turner. An ok quick read."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"_Black Valley_ was easily the worst book I've read in years. I don't know why I stuck with it, but I did finish. Unbelievable, two-dimensional characters with ridiculous, pseudo-scientific explanations--I'm amazed this book ever got published in the first place. Just the fact that garbage like this CAN in fact find a publisher ought to be a ray of hope for all the real writers out there. Terrible, terrible, terrible! Not recommended!"},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"I have not read Jim Brown's previous effort (24/7)...perhaps if I had I would not have spent good money on this book. Black Valley is so full of grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, context errors and malapropisms (example: &quot;collective conscience&quot; instead of &quot;collective conscious&quot;) that I found the book nearly impossible to read. How anyone could compare Jim Brown to Dean Koontz is beyond me. Koontz is a master of the language, whereas Brown could benefit from a remedial English class. If you are even halfway literate, you will not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"I grew up in Oregon, and fictional Black Valley is all too believable. The settings, characters, dialogue, are recognizable to any small-town Oregonians. Of course, Jim Brown used to anchor the news in the area where I lived, so he should be capable of painting an accurate picture.Oh, and what a picture he paints!\\"Black Valley\\" is the epitome of suspense fiction. Full of bizarre scenarios, walking dead men, and gruesome deaths, this book will take you by the throat and shake that slumber from your eyes. I tried to go to sleep a few times, but, no, \\"Black Valley\\" insisted that I press on to the wild finale.As with Brown's \\"24/7,\\" the story is tightly plotted, and he juggles his characters without dropping the reader in the process. Also, as in his debut novel, he allows only brief moments for us to care about these characters. Intermittently, I was touched by their inner dilemmas, but Brown relies on the plot to chase us through each chapter. In the end, despite the flurried page turning, I had little concern or connection with those thrust into this horrendous maelstrom of suspense.If you want intelligent storytelling that takes your breath away, Brown is a master. Both his novels will satisfy. He comes up with terrific premises, and, just when you think the ideas are too farfetched to believe, he comes up with ways of making them palatable--even frightening. No time for deep characterization here, but no time for sleeping either. These books will grab you by the throat."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"I was riveted from the first sentence to the last. Black Valley is without a doubt one of the best books I've read this year. It kept me guessing, kept me terrified and, most importantly, kept me reading.According to the bio, Jim Brown is a television anchor man (now I know what they do durrng the commercials -- they come up with bone chilling ideas -- or at least this one does.I liked it so much I'm going and read his first novel, 24/7."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"I always take a moment to read other reviews before I write my own to get an idea how my opinion agrees or differs. I found with this book, people either loved it or hated it, there wasn't any in-between. I am one of those who loved it.A young man is buried alive and years later, comes back to exact his revenge. The story was a cross between night of the living dead and Dr. Who!This book had much to offer. The story moved along nicely, without any odd moments. The author didn't waste a lot of paper describing unimportant things just to have an epic novel. I like that in a book, just get to the point. The characters were believable and well developed. I find people are much too hard on horror writers. It's fiction at its finest and at no time needs to be believable. It's purpose is to entertain, and having said that, let me assure you that Mr. Brown did a bang up job entertaining this reader. It was not overly technical or hard to follow. I loved the book and hope you will too."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"Mr. Brown does a fine job with this book. Keeps you quessing right to the end. How are the murders happening? Who is the real killer? And whats up with the Bum with the biblical name? Highly recommended Fast read IE a Page turner. I just love time travel books and this one has it all Past Present and Future.

I see by the other reviews (most of them anyway) that it was highly enjoyed. My comments are mixed. This book was extremely well written. The suspense was present from the beginning and kept me riveted...until 2/3 into the story. When &quot;Dr. Dean&quot; starts figuring out what is happening, I lost interest. The problem: the ending belonged in a science-fiction book. I would have been happy with either a supernatural ending or a &quot;thriller&quot; ending, but this story ended up in Robert Heinlein land. I HATE SCIENCE-FICTION, that is why I buy thrillers. I think it was a mistake for the author to do this.So, for me, this one only rates 3 stars."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"There are for readers few pleasures that surpass picking up a novel and having one's expectations, however high they may be, simultaneously exceeded and turned upside down. 2003 has been a good year for such an experience, what with SMALL TOWN by Lawrence Block and SHUTTER ISLAND by Dennis Lehane, among others. It is, however, an unexpected and welcome event to have a writer accomplish such a feat with a sophomore effort. This is precisely what Jim Brown has done with BLACK VALLEY.BLACK VALLEY opens with what could be called a &quot;locked coffin&quot; mystery --- what else do you call it when you lock someone in a coffin, bury them, unearth the coffin a few hours later and find it empty? The story then picks up 22 years later, as things in Black Valley, Oregon begin to rapidly and inexplicably reach FUBAR status. The action seems to gradually center on five people: John Evans, the town sheriff; Nathan Perkins, the mayor; Clyde Watkins, the area's congressman; Mason Evans, the founder of a successful construction company and John's cousin; and Dean Truman, self-effacing genius, Nobel-prize winner, and professor at the local college. The five were boyhood friends, and all except Truman were involved 22 years before in the prank burial of a dangerous misfit named Whitey Dobbs, a burial that went suddenly and horribly wrong.Now Whitey Dobbs, missing from the casket and Black Valley for 22 years, suddenly reappears, as inexplicable events begin to occur in and around the town. Truman holds to his core belief that there are no phenomena that cannot be explained scientifically. His belief is shaken, however, when occurrences in and around the town become more mysterious, and more and more deadly. Truman slowly realizes that he may hold the key not only to the reappearance of Dobbs, but also to the deadly events that are occurring --- and that he may well be responsible for them. And the key to everything may partly lie in the secret that Truman has kept for decades, the secret that has prevented him from leaving BLACK VALLEY.BLACK VALLEY is a genre-blurring book, mixing equal parts suspense, mystery, horror, and a few other things as well, to create a novel that from beginning to end is impossible to predict or anticipate and that surprises from first page to last. Brown, who created the expectation of more great things with 24/7, his first novel, meets that expectation and surpasses it. There is no doubt he will continue to do so: books as good as BLACK VALLEY don't come along by accident. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"This was one of the best novels that I've ever read! Jim Brown is a truly talented author. Black Valley was hard to put down. The very first chapter was so shocking and inspiring to me, mere words cannot describe the feeling that it gave me. The best thing about this novel is that I could not predict what would happen from one chapter to the next. I was reading Black Valley while writing Twisted Christians. Jim Brown's story set the standard for my first novel, tearing down the threshold that separates the imagination from reality. In Jim Brown's world, anything is possible.--Scott"},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"My dad whom is a fire fighter and a 'tough' guy read the first few chapters and said it was too scary, so I would keep that in mind.

Hope you read and enjoy it, I know I did."},{"Title":"Black Valley (PB)","review":"Jim Brown's first novel 24/7 impressed the heck out of me, so I was excited to see that his second book, Black Valley, was now available. I went out, bought a copy, and began reading. Fortunately, this happened on a day when I didn't have much on my agenda, because once I started Black Valley I could not put it down. Having to abandon Black Valley midway, even for a few hours, would have been hard to do!If you like mysteries, this book is definitely for you--Jim Brown has woven an intriguing tale that mystery lovers will enjoy trying to solve (although Black Valley has so many fun twists and turns I didn't even come close to guessing any of its secrets!) If you love horror, Black Valley will not disappoint you--Jim Brown's imagination rivals that of Stephen King. If you love science fiction, you are definitely in luck as Black Valley is filled with fascinating explanations and plots. If you like suspense, then all I can say is hang on and buckle your seat belt, as this book will literally make your pulse pound--I see from reading other reviews that I am not the only one who had such a reaction while reading this incredible book.I won't bother going into the plot, as it has already been well-described up above, but I do want to comment on the villain, Whitey Dobbs. Dobbs is easily one of the most evil and creepy bad guys I have ever encountered in literature, and I loved every heebie-jeebie filled minute of him. Part &quot;Killer Bob&quot; from Twin Peaks, part &quot;the Ghost&quot; from Harlan Coben's novel &quot;Gone for Good&quot; and part Freddy Krueger, Dobbs is still a unique and original villain that may just haunt you for days long after the book is finished.I highly recommend giving Black Valley a try--you won't be disappointed!

Testimonials by Martin Luther himself in an updated version of the German language, a branch of Olde English. Daily readings for every day, but the days were written by Luther day he wrote the book. Germans are very good speed readers, so the whole book can be read in a few weeks by literate people who are proud of their German heritage. The main thing at Luther's church is communion."},{"Title":"Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional","review":"Having read through the Roland Bainton biography of Luther (\\"Here I Stand\\"), then watching the recently released video of the Reformer's life (\\"Luther\\"), I was very interested in reading some of the writings of this incredible man. Along comes \\"Faith Alone\\" which has whetted my appetite for more.Although I am not a big suporter of daily devotionals, this one has the advantage of having an index that lists the subject matter for each day at the close of the book. It is a joy to be able to read Martin Luther's thoughts on practical, living Christianity in a modern, concise translation.My appreciation for Luther, and what God did through his life, is magnified through \\"Faith Alone.\\" I encourage those who would like to be strengthened and find courage to stand in the midst of trial to consider the words of Luther in this devotional book.Update to review on August 30, 2012: Our family has been reading Luther's \\"The Freedom of a Christian,\\" and having read this small volume, I am re-rating Jim Galvin's devotional book to be 5 stars. It captures the compelling conviction of a man who truly had to live by faith alone during one of history's most challenging hours."},{"Title":"Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional","review":"\\"Faith Alone\\" is an outstanding resource for anyone interested in profound and provoking daily passages from one the of the greats of the Christian faith. The selections from Luther's sermons and writing, each linked with Scripture, provide great wisdom relevant to everyday living (trusting God, finances, relationships) as well as key theological teachings. The themes covered include a nice range of topics and the passages themselves are refreshing and challenging. The translation is extremely readible. This book is a great combination of thoughtful insight married to an extremely accessible format of short daily readings. Add this to your list of \\"devotional greats\\"!"},{"Title":"Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional","review":"I've spent years looking for a devotional that suits me. I knew I wanted one that would give me something to think about during the day but not take too long in the morning. I knew I wanted something that included everything right there on the page so I didn't have to juggle devotional, hymnal and Bible. I knew I wanted something that wasn't dumbed down, overly simple, ignored life's problems or made it sound like my personal relationship with Jesus was all that mattered.I thought my standards were too high. They weren't. This is readable but intelligent; convenient but not too brief; and very faithful. You get a verse of scripture and then the rest of the page is a passage from one of Luther's works (lots of variety) that relates to it in some way. Most of them have to do with some piece of Christian living or practical theology. All very much stuff that relates to everyday life and applies to *me*, not just the perfect image of a Christian I have in my head. Great book. Also made to last."},{"Title":"Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional","review":"I am very familiar with his spot in church history, but not too familiar with Luther's writings. I like this devotional-- it is an excellent reminder of the call to believers that \\"we live by faith, not by sight\\" and that we rest because of Christ's work, not our own. I've been encouraged, challenged, and prodded to follow Christ whole-heartedly as I've read through the selections of the last few months."},{"Title":"Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional","review":"With, Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional, the english world has a long awaited devotional in their hands.

This book is a collection of many of his best pieces, arranged into daily devotionals, and edited into contemporary english. As such, it allows the pastoral side of Luther to speak to the reader each day with edifying passages on faith, daily living, etc. The book also includes a subject index to look up passages that pertain to certain topics, as well as an index of sources, allowing the interested reader to consult the original works for further study.Many works of Luther are not as approachable for lay readers due to stultified translation. This book does a very good job of removing that artificial barrier, allowing Luther to speak to today's readers in plain language.

So few innovative writers are readable. So few readable writers achieve something worth reading. The astounding formal innovations here are absolutely integral to the work. Barthelme feels like the smartest, funniest, most sarcastic person in your humanities seminar. An example of postmodern fiction that makes resentful continental postmodern criticism obsolete in advance.To compare. Among modern American writers with ideas about American culture Pynchon competes but sometimes does less with more. These stories are stripped to the skeleton. The omnivorous imagination here is like Borges but the learning of obscure ancient cultures has been replaced by the obscurities of our equally arcane popular culture.Unless you have to write a dissertation replace Foucault and Derrida with this on your reading list.

Might be the best 63 cents I've ever spent. I doubt I got the point, if there was one or many, to many of the stories in this collection, but it didn't even matter. Barthelme's humor and accessible language made each story a pleasure to read (except for Bone Bubbles, a stream-of-conscious, punctuationless, seemingly disconnected (what did I miss?!?!?!) ramble). I'm full of superlatives for Senor Barthelme. Creative fiction at its finest! Knows no bounds! The Donald has broken the plain of American fiction and on and on and on.

It combines readability with many references to academic/medical studies and snippets from interviews of bipolars. The book is informative and detailed as well as compassionate. The anecdotal pieces are not vague musings about being bipolar, but rather personal experience to complement the scientific data of any given topice. The book does not forever dwell on what bipolarism is, but instead quickly details the disease then moves on to how to continue living with the highest possible quality of life when you have the disease. Like any good graduate text, it starts with the most basic information and quickly helps the reader up the learning curve of the topic to discuss the most advanced and recent research on how to deal with the illness. This book is outstanding."},{"Title":"Adult Bipolar Disorders: Understanding Your Diagnosis and Getting Help","review":"Except for 2 Chapters in the book the bulk talks about areas other than Bipolar illness.

I can see Jerk right now down at the Old Timers late night looking to beat the crap out of Kory, or anybody that looks like him, is related to him, dated him or knows (has known) him. Jerk's comments are a form of Gloucester love - the love that can only be dished out by a fisherman. Once Kory is beaten beyond recognition by the current Greasy Pole Champion (who's probably still suffering from a severe case of swollen fiestacles), Kory will be flipping trucks in Saint Peter's Square with all the guys - just like the good old days.So read the book, it's eerily accurate in it's own kind of way, but to truly understand I would suggest a visit to Gloucester, Massachusetts during the last weekend in June to experience Saint Peter's Fiesta for yourselves."},{"Title":"St. Peter's Fiasco: The Perfect Storm Spoof","review":"At first, I didn't know what to expect.

(possibly his third) Yet, there is nothing to indicate he was only starting out. Right away he grabs our attention with the funeral of King Henry V. Henry V's brothers Bedford and Gloucester help us to see the virtues and strengths of the deceased king. The Bishop of Winchester is well drawn as a comical villain who plots and plans, but never succeeds in doing any real damage. (Not until the next play anyway.) Talbot is memorable as the selfless hero of the play. York is memorable as the hero who defeats Joan of Arc. King Henry VI himself is interesting. First we see him as a helpless infant. By the third act, we see that he has both strengths and weaknesses. He makes the mistake of dividing the command between the rivals Somerset and York. But also, we see that he does not tolerate treason or neglect of duty. There are also many memorable scenes. The garden scene that foreshadows the War of the Roses is well drawn. The scene where York comforts his dying uncle is tragic beauty. Bedford's death in 3.2 has almost a divine tone. The death of Talbot and his son is very lamentable. York's sudden rise to power is captivating. Perhaps Shakespeare's greatest achievement in this play is that he simultaneously shows us England's war with France and the dissension with England itself."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry VI (The Arden edition of the works of William Shakespeare)","review":"This is not quite as good as 1 or 2, but it is still excellent! Shakespeare grabs us with the dispute between Henry VI and York. While it seems to end peacefully it does not, and the war goes on! York's death in 1.4 is another landmark in Shakespeare's writing. The scene (2.5) where Henry finds true terror is horror, sorrow, and yet beauty and yet another moving part of the play. (The son that hath killed his father and the father that hath killed his son.) The war pauses in disaster for Henry and some comic relief is offered. But the horror starts all over again when Edward IV and Warwick have a falling out. The war starts over again, and the King of France gets involved! The scene where King Henry VI is reinstated is a scene of beauty and hope. While all of this is happening, Shakespeare carefully prepares the monstrously satanic character of Richard III. From here, the play just gets more and more bloody. A final moment of horror is offered when the eventual Richard III proudly compares himself to the one who betrayed Christ. In part 4 &quot;Richard III,&quot; the real terror begins!"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry VI (The Arden edition of the works of William Shakespeare)","review":"The three books that cover the life Henry VI are each masterpieces in their own right.

Nevertheless, I usually could not figure out what Adams was getting at in his overly poetic abstractions. As other reviewers have pointed out, Adams can never simply describe concretely what he sees, but instead has to formulate some sort of generalization, as when the \\"dynamo\\"--a machine he sees at a World's Fair--becomes a symbol for the sweeping forces of mechanization and industrialization. That sounds insightful, but did he really need an entire chapter to describe how it upheaved his soul?Adams wrote this book for his close circle of friends, not the general public. This manifests when he casually tosses around the names of obscure people without explaining who they are, as if we are just supposed to know. I often kept Wikipedia open as I read.Unless you are already an expert on 19th-century U.S. history, be prepared for a hard slog and, I regret to predict, a lack of fulfillment."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Searching for an education is the basis of this autobiography of Henry Adams, grandson of President John Quincy Adams and great-grandson of President John Adams. His search for an education leads to him re-examine his childhood, he college years, his travels, and other important parts of his life. To be honest, I read this book for a college autobiography course and I was one of very few students in the class who liked the book. Adams is extremely thorough and descriptive in the novel which makes the novel hard to read and understand. The reader will very often have to look up words. To put it more generally, it reads like a history textbook throughout. After first reading the book, I hated it. The more I thought about it though, I came to realize that it was an excellent book. Adams is a talented and artistic writer and the book is a wonderfully written historical novel. If you enjoy politics and/or history, you will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Who am I to say that this is not a great book? Numerous scholars have called it one of the best non-fiction books ever. But man, what a grind it is. Now that I've plowed through about half of the book, I'm throwing in the towel.To my tiny, contemporary brain, this book is hopelessly ponderous and self-indulgent. The constant use of the third person and the education theme wore thin in the initial chapters. Perhaps I've misread him, perhaps he's poking fun at himself, but the author sounds truly insufferable. Even when he's being self depricating, it rings false.There are some interesting nuggets in this book, like the descriptions of the 1860's London social scene, a few witticisms, and some of his travel experiences as a young man. But, I felt that the effort I had to expend to dig to them was not worth it. The book is a tough trek, and your companion for the trip, Mr. James, makes it all the longer by prattling on, sneering at the unwashed masses, and bragging about his family."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"The writing of Henry Adams can take some getting used to. At times he seems pompous, and falsely modest (after all, how modest can you be when you have decided to write an autobiography of your life), but I suspect the reality is that Adams is simply the product of another time. Clearly influenced by his illustrious family (great grandson of John Adams, grandson of John Quincy Adams, and son of Charles Francis Adams, a Congressman and Ambassador), one can clearly imagine that this is precisely how he was brought up to be, a product of the 18th and 19th centuries. The result is a biography, \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" which is both personal, and yet touches on several important moments in history.In this book, Adams thinks little of formal education and sees it as not preparing him for his life to come. The education he is talking about for most of the book, is the education he gets from the experiences of life. Those experiences come from his travel, the deep and long friendships he develops with Clarence King and John Milton Hay, and of course from reading.From his early life, one story really stuck with me, and that is Adams relating his Grandfather, and at the time former President, escorting a stubborn and defiant young Henry Adams to school. Such a scene probably could never happen again, but imagine the impact on the other students to have a President of the United States bring a classmate to school.One of the most interesting political stories from the book is a long one, detailing his father's period as Ambassador to the United Kingdom during Lincoln's administration. Adams discusses the attitude towards the representatives of the Union and how his father built up a tremendous amount of respect after initially being viewed as a lightweight. Henry Adams served as his father's personal secretary for those eight years, and they had to deal with the attempts by the Confederacy to get recognized and receive aid. An interesting side-note to this period is that they had exchanges of letters with Karl Marx.Other significant subjects that Adams covers include his personal views on several Presidents, including some very strong feelings about Grant, as well as some lack of interest many that came after, and concern over the youth of Roosevelt. Science also is a key subject, and Adams discusses Darwin, Radium, and other changes which he is overcome by, and predicts quite correctly that the advances in the 20th century will make those of the 19th appear small. Lastly, as mentioned before, the friendships that Adams forms with King and Hay have a tremendous impact on his entire autobiography.What is missing from this book is 20 years, and an important 20 years it was for Adams, as it is the period of his marriage to Marian Hooper, whom was commonly called Clover. There is no doubt that this period of Adams life would have been filled with tremendous contrasts, both the joy they shared, and the immense sorrow he must have felt when she was depressed and eventually committed suicide. The reader has been denied the personal perspective of Adams, and it is our loss.I very much enjoyed this autobiography, and it helped that I had read other works by Adams so that I was prepared for his style and manner. I preferred this book to Adams \\"Mont Saint Michel and Chartres\\", and the subject matter is certainly broader and likely to appeal to a wider audience. This book was nominated and selected as \\"The Best Book of the 20th Century\\" by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, and the winner of the 1919 Pulitzer Prize for Biography/Autobiography. Despite all that, I am giving it just four stars. I feel his style takes some getting used to, and the absence of those 20 years is felt."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Still reading through it, but it is good and author has put a significant effort into rethinking education. Definitely a must read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"This book wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, but I had huge expectations for it because the only reason I read it was because the \\"Modern Library\\" list ranked it #1, but I still thought the book was very good. I wasn't familiar with Henry Adams and didn't know why I should care what he did during his life, but the further I got into the book the more interesting it became. I've been traveling through Europe for a year and thought that Adams and I shared similar opinions about traveling and other things about Europe, so that was interesting due to the large time gap. But I enjoyed the story because I thought it was an interesting depiction of America, Europe and how one has difficulty understanding the world and the challenges one experiences during life. A book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"In 1885, Adams wife Marion committed suicide. Upon her death, Adams took up a restless life in trotting around the globe and travelling extensively. For years, he spent summers in Paris and winters in Washington, DC. In 1907 he pubished this Pulitzer Prize winning autobiography. This work contains the birth of forces that Adams saw as replacing Chrisianity and has the reputation of being the the most important non-fiction work of the 20th century and I am hard pressed to disagree!"},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I had this book on my shelf for at least 15 years before I tackled it. It's as good as hoped for, but one bizarre aspect should be mentioned. Writing about what he has learned in a long life, Adams concludes that the more valuable lessons were NOT from academic studies, but from personal encounters and friendships. Yet there is no mention of his marriage, which ended in his wife's suicide. Twenty years of living and learning (during which time he married and was widowed) are left out of this book, which he wrote in his 70s. The tone of this personal book is as if it were written for his friends, who knew of this tragedy and would have respected his privacy and pain. Yet today's reader might well conclude that no relationship with a women had ever taught Adams anything, which is not the case.After reading this, I read a fine biography of his wife titled \\"Clover Adams.\\" Mrs. Adams was a great letter writer and her father kept every letter she had ever written him, which survive today. This book fills in the blanks of Henry's book, by describing what had at one time been a happy marriage, before his wife's depression and suicide. (Clover's sister also committed suicide and her other sister died young, leaving five young daughters. That brother-in-law also killed himself. There was yet another suicide in an older generation of that family.)The \\"Clover Adams\\" bio incorporates letters she wrote to friends and loved ones throughout their marriage, as well as letters Henry Adams wrote to friends about their life. Reading both books can enhance the experience of reading either one and will increase an understanding and appreciation of this very likable couple."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Henry Adams grew up having numerous opportunities available, yet a limited perspective inherited of politically viewing these perspectives from an unbiased, alternative point of view. However, he was far ahead of his time as he didn't allow the constraints of his traditional, plain vanilla, New England raised, Harvard educated upbrining get in his way of addressing what really matters to being happy, satisfied, contempt in 19th century American society.This book is many things: as he himself referred to a search of meaningful truth through education that could be utilized in the long-term and is not brushed under the carpet after it's application for a particular task has been deemed unnecessary; a search for inner and outer spiritual balance and connectedness with the past, present, and unknowable future in an age of rapid change, discovery, and industrial transformation; and finally the importance of having gratitude and honoring born-out priveleges, while seeking to expand one's intellectual and social horizons and affiliations.The analogy to the mechanistic dynamo and his educational interpretation of needing to brede scientifically minded, evolution espousing mathematical minds and his other whimsical social inferences have proved prophetic and were way ahead of his time. From his ruminations on the unique cultural differences toward the work-play ethic of Germany, France, Italy, and England , to his analysis of the ill-founded corrupt Grant and Reconstruction era Presidencies, to the evolution of the diplomatist's political importance and stature, and finally whether his life truly added something significant to himself and society, Adams is a philosophical genius listening and taking it all in as his world vastly changes and transforms itself on a locomotive train ride. In the end he found education through the traditional means of the textbook and teacher-pupil method successful if adapted toward science and technology, but inadequate as only experience and traveling brought on the proper perspective and long-term balanced outlook for an individual. These conclusive findings is the primary reason to read this philosophically inquisitive book, as many of the other's thought processes and findings bear strong truths to today's hustle-n-bustle lifestyle."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Having read Amazon reviews that range from laudatory to scathing, I'm drawn to put in my 2 cents worth on this classic, in spite of the fact that the jury is already in, decisively. This book is difficult. I started it twice and put it down twice. Finally I jumped ahead to his account of service as private secretary to his father's embassy to Britain during the Civil War and was caught in the flow of eloquence. Hennry James expresses himself sharply, with grace and candor. It is true that some passages strike a hollow note, such as when he pities his plight in London, being banished to parties while his friends have the &quot;honor&quot; of achieving rank on battlefriends. And his attempts to bring the jargon of science (and electrical dynamos) to the discipline of history are a poignant (and tedious) commentary on the dominance of physics as the holder of mysteries in 1900. But for those who can be patient occasionally, and who have an interest in the period (Gore Vidal's novels make it more accessible), this is truly a fine, ennobling read, by a wise observer of humanity."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I can't get any more descriptive than that...it put me to sleep faster than Whitman."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"This book was so slow and boring, I couldn't stand to finish it. Henry Adams was just another modernist author who was unsatisfied with his life in the world of the wealthy elite. I couldn't identify with him at all. He just seemed to be another wealthy stuck up man, at times bored and disturbed by the unfulfilling and superficial life he led. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who's not ready for a long, slow read."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Henry Adams starts off his autobiography with a description of how tough he's had it living up to the standard of his president great-grandfather, president grandfather, and ambassador to the UK father. Lest the reader who was not born so high-brow as this laugh at the self-absorption that would permit such an upbringing to be conceived of as deprived, Adams then admits that being born with a silver spoon in one's mouth to coincide with such a lineage makes his a minor difficulty compared to the world's real problems. It is this self-awareness and honesty that makes this as excellent a book as it is. Sure, Adams had to live up to a high standard but he also was in a situation where it was possible to do it, and where even failure would be in comfort. Adams' descriptions of his life's longing for education are remarkably honest throughout, and his ability to step outside of the 'holy writ' of entrenched teachings shows that his was a mind that constantly sought answers actually worth their merit. He waxes philosophical (as opposed to autobiographical) at the end, but it is here (&quot;The Virgin and the Dynamo,&quot; for example) that he may be at his most profound. Even if you don't agree with his thoughts, he does stimulate consideration of ideas that you may not have previously broached. Lastly, Henry Adams is/was a profoundly arrogant man, although not entirely condescending. I find this refreshing; that he knew his abilities and was comfortable enough in them to not feel the need to fake humility."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I tried reading this book in my twenties. Couldn't do it. Too much of it was inaccessible to me. The book, which was written privately for his friends, assumes a certain knowledge of events that most readers, understandably, will not have. It also is deeply metaphysical and reflective and written from the perspective of someone who has lived a full and varied life, which, well, bored me. If I had written a review of it then, it probably wouldn't have been a very positive one.But, when you're forty, half of you belongs to the past, as the saying goes, so I picked up this book again. I loved it.Adams offers probably the best insight into the century that transformed America of any author from his time. He must have been astounded-especially given his revolutionary heritage-to witness the Sons of Liberty turn into empire builders, all within the span of a few generations. His political observations especially often are prescient. He saw, it seems, the coming of war in Europe and German nationalism. In fact, many of his observations in general are prescient, when they're not too inscrutable.Not a book for everyone, but definitely a book worth visiting or revisiting, if you think you might be interested.Would also recommend The Flowering of New England, 1815-1865 and New England: Indian Summer, 1865-1915 by Van Wyck Brooks as companion pieces."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I had heard of the importance, and significance of \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.I am sorry I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.\\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.When Eric Sevareid wrote \\"Not So Wild a Dream,\\" it was compared to \\"The Education of Henry Adams.\\" That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it. I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"The Autobiography of Henry Adams details his lifelong search for a useful education. It takes some time to see that Adams is poking fun at himself for how little formal education takes with him. There are certainly some great truths in this book--how what we learn is not always what we start out to study, how the most valuable lessons often come from unexpected sources and even from great failures, how education is truly a lifelong pursuit, and how much of what one would like to know concerning the meaning of life is ultimately unknowable. At the same time, Henry seems to have been overwhelmed by the accomplishments of his ancestors and the autobiography is something of a justification for a life not fully lived. I could not help feeling that had Henry had a real need to work for a living, he might have gotten more out of his education, both formal and otherwise. Some of the events and historical figures that Adams discusses are relatively obscure for a modern audience."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously, even if many of the references to names and events were beyond my little intellect. I was most impressed how this one man was able to connect the colonial period to the beginning of the technological age, showing it all to be one continuum. The book made me see the link between events of the 1800s to what is happening now. It was difficult to read but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I read this book for the first time in the Navy in 1948 and have just read it for the fifth time. I love to read his discriptions of people. Lincoln, Grant, Sumner to name a few. They are very incisive. Some parts are intentionally recondite but promote thought. If I am fortunate I will read it again in a few years."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I'm half inclined to blame this book for choking up my reviewing agenda. It took me a very long time to read, and also a very long time to review. I found I needed quite a bit of time to capture my reading notes, and to try to come to terms with what I had read.And, to be truthful, I'm not really sure I have succeeded. Despite all the time this book took me, and despite my notes, I'm not really sure I have the feeling I really read the thing. I feel as though I wish I had. But have been tested and found wanting-- or something like that.This is an autobiography, and as a reader Adams' habit of describing himself in the third person is quite jarring. I suppose this is because it is still written like a journal, or an autobiography, which really are quite first person forms. Third person voice implies a measure of description, a kind of central point. Marrying the two kept causing me to draw myself out of the text, sputtering. I never really got used to it & had to relax again into it every time I picked it up at night.The subject matter is fascinating. Unlike some of other reviewers, I was fascinated by the minutae of the time. I would have rather Adams had stayed with that material. The book jumps around quite a bit in his life, and I found myself making liberal use of both introduction and footnotes in order to sort out where I was.He was a sad man, who mocked himself. The use of the third person voice seems to hold off any possibility of comfort or justification. I'm not sure if I really got a look of Adams as a man-- don't know enough about his life to judge. But it was a very vivid image of someone.I'd recommend it, I suppose. With caveats. I'm still trying to get my head around it, to be honest."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Note that this review is for the audio book narrated by David Colacci. I have been on a kick the last year or so of listening to the \`classics' on my daily commute. This book has been on several lists of great books and I decided to give it a try. I started out wondering why this book would be considered so good, but after a few hours of listening I learned to appreciate the unique writing style and personality of the author.The narrator was perfect for the part. His voice and manner of speaking fit the style of the book very well. He sounded just like I imagined Adams himself would have sounded if he had read this book.I have always been a fan of history, and his perspective as a minor participant in several great events was fascinating. From the Civil War to the Teddy Roosevelt administration, he provided several interesting insights into those events. He knew many of the key players. His overriding theme of obtaining an \`education' was also interesting and he looked at it much more broadly than most people would. He lived at a time of great technological change, especially from a perspective of power and seemed concerned that society was not ready to handle that much power. He saw the source of power switching from Christianity (The Virgin Mary) to the dynamo.I initially didn't like him. He seemed almost too humble and didn't seem to have a strong opinion of right and wrong because he wasn't sure which was which. In the end I appreciated his perspective and thought he would have been an interesting person to know, though I wouldn't consider him as a great leader. I also would have liked to have him talk more of his personal life; note that this book omits the years 1872-1891, which would have included his marriage.Overall I recommend this book for anyone interested in history and a unique literary style. He was clearly an intellectual and it gives a good snapshot of the intellectual views of that era."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I was first drawn into the book \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" when Henry Adams wrote how he was led to \\"... more than once to sit at sunset on the steps of the Church of Santa Maria di Ara Coeli...\\" (page 91) Adams wanted to teach people how we can teach ourselves. He wanted to say that knowledge devoid of feeling is of little use and meaning. He said, towards the end of the book and towards the end of his life, \\"All the teacher could hope was to teach it reaction.\\" Despite his willful, self-imposed criticism of his own inadequacies and failures, he succeeded brilliantly in teaching us how to achieve our own personal Annunciation, as he obviously experienced his, at sunset on the steps of the Church of Santa Maria di Ara Coeli."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"it has thorough, helpful notes that help fill in the historical gaps in the book. I was hooked straight from the beginning when I saw the detatched way that he was going to try and write about himself in the third person. He writes beautifully, and thankfully, he doesn't stay too detatched, nor is he quite reliable. He's way too &quot;modest&quot; about his abilities and education. But the sadness that comes as he gets older, the pace changes, and the energy shift, is amazing. You also see the world that he lived in, and for someone of his time, the extensive travels and encounters that he experienced surely cannot have been surpassed. The book is a lesson on massachusetts political, religious, and philosophical thought, as well as a critique of that fromsomeone who explored the rest of the world. There are certain parts of the book which relate to local current politics of the time which may not be of interest to anyone but real historians. But overall, this is an excellent read for anyone. It is a book about human experience and education."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"As the grandson of America's sixth president, John Quincy Adams, and great grandson of America's second president, John Adams, Henry Adams was born to a distinguished New England heritage. His biography recounts the education he received, lamenting the inadequacy of formal schooling in preparing him to live ably during a century of revolutionary technological and philosophical change. Within his comments are wry insights that sometimes draw a smile from the reader, such as his definition of a schoolmaster: &quot;A man employed to tell lies to little boys.&quot; Adams' views are rather cynical and somewhat fatalistic, but they do reflect the grand changes taking place during his lifetime.

Old, beat-up-but a treasure"},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"The Kindle edition of THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS conveniently provides the reader the opportunity to read one of the most fascinating autobiographies that deciphers the history in which Henry Adams lived. Originally printed privately in 1907 but published in 1918 and later earning a Pulitzer Prize and accolades as the world's great autobiographies, the book is a long conversation, which stretches limitless boundaries and eclipses various topics from the history of science that included geology and anthropology as well as the humanities, history, literature, and philosophy. But one will also see Adams's inner qualities as a self-reflective, intelligent and narcissistic man.Undoubtedly, Adams's narrative is a stark reflection of his life that was immensely enriched with history and buttressed between intellect and inquiry or so-called \\"galloping mind.\\" With the mere fact that his great-grandfather was John Adams and his grandfather was John Quincy Adams, two of the most illustrious presidents in US history, and his father, Charles Francis Adams, served as President Lincoln's appointed American minister to the Court of St. James, there would be no escaping the political history that was engraved within his pedigree. Having lived throughout the nineteenth century and observing all aspects of history-in-the-making during the period of the Republic and the Gilded Age, Adams attempts to examine the most pivotal parts of history. However, as one reads, there is a somewhat limited and ambiguous quality of Adams's understanding of the East, which falls precisely under the category of the straight and narrow and highly romanticized and misconstrued.After reading THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS, one may see that learning is a never-ending cycle. Although parts of the book appear dated, there is plenty of food for thought within his narrative that shows how Adams's education clearly resonates the most pinnacle part of intellectual history that was the Enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I am comparing this Kindle book with a paperback edition published by Houghton Mifflin.

If you ever wondered how America was transformed from 18th Century idealism to the current political cynicism, this book might add a clue. Be warned, you must first wade through the muck of Adams'18th Century New England pretentiousness. Expect a jaded view of events and figures of the time, especially concerning the Civil War. Still, it does serve to help answer the question, &quot;What would historical figures like John Adams or Daniel Webster had thought about evolution of American politics.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I first read EDUCATION in graduate school. The book has a great deal of interesting commentary on events of Adams' times. The touch-and-go in England to prevent aid to the South is one example. The autobiographical and historical commentary alone make the book worthwhile. Adams' discussion of the Virgin and the dynamo, however, are even more applicable now than in the early nineteenth century. (Adams also wrote a poem on this theme. It was not in my earlier Modern Library copy, but was reprinted in a journal or book.)"},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"(It is certainly exciting that the internet provides a chance for book-lovers to discuss not just new books but classics. People write thoughtful reviews only for the glorious reason of expressing ideas; that certainly gives one hope for humanity. . .)Sometimes H. Adams makes one laugh, other times one just wants to grab him by his starched collar and slap him across the face a few times. Stop whining about the failure of education! One doubts he even KNOWS what he has learned and what he has not!The most frustrating aspect of this book is the fact that the experience which clearly would have caused him to learn the most, the suicide of his wife, is completely omitted. Clearly he did not believe he could discuss such a horrendous event without deviating from his measured, cynical detachment (which is not without its benefits), so he just skips over it! We only know that post 1890 is his &quot;posthumous&quot; period, where he is even more cold and sober than before.Emotional content is sorely lacking in this book. If we are going to relate to someone born into such unique circumstances, we need to find what is human about him, joy and sorrow. Not just amusement and cynicism.Another big problem with the book is the relentless of name-dropping of (now) obscure 19th century pols and esoteric references. It really slows it down for the reader.All that being said, this is a very worthwhile book. Adams has much to teach us about America, if not ourselves. His generalizations are pat but often incisive, his writing is full of 19th century flavor, and he is the insider's insider to D.C. shenanigans. He is full of quips and insights that still hold true today (European perceptions of Amerericans, the state of British cuisine, etc.)The book is challenging in a good way. Just try fully grasping some of labrynthian run-on sentences."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"This books is indeed full of some memorable aphorisms. Adams certainly lived through some remarkable changes, but to someone who is not particularly well-versed in the period, many of the references to people and events will be maddeningly and drearily obscure. This edition (The Mariner Paperback) would be greatly improved by the inclusion of thorough explanatory notes. Also, the memoir is strangely recounted in the third person, which contributes to a disagreeable distance between the author and the reader, making it difficult to get a sense of the &quot;real&quot; Henry Adams."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Since I like autobiographies and biographies I like this book. He lets you see what a aristocratic (but Chrisitan based) family was like in the days of the establishment of the United States as a country. He talks about travels, influences, and personal reflections.Since the theme of his book is his personal education, a thought he has on that subject seems appropriate for a review. He writes, &quot;Unless education marches on both feet--theoryand practice--it risks going astray...&quot; That philosophy seems to be consistent throughout the generations. If you like to compare your thoughts with those reflective adventurers of other generations, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I bought this version and started reading it, but ended up buying another version.

There is never any mention of a wife or children in this book but Mr. Adams does give a background of his lineage. Henry Adams has a very readable prose and it is very evident that he is a highly educated individual, quite the contrary to what he wishes the readers to believe.

By the end, of course, they are dead, and have learned nothing, influenced nothing, and contributed nothing.I could easily describe \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" with the exact same words (substituting the singular Henry Adams for the plural Rosencrantz and Guildenstern).Adams did not intend the book to be a biography, and it certainly isn't, if only because it completely omits about twenty years of his life. And if it HAD been a biography, it would have been an unusually boring one, since he didn't lead a particularly interesting life. He didn't intend it to be a history book either, since he was not a close or first-hand observer of most of the significant historical events that occurred during his lifetime. The most important event during his lifetime was the Civil War, and he didn't even spend that time in the United States!Adams apparently intended this book to be a book about education, but if he had anything noteworthy to say on the subject, I certainly missed it - and I'm an educator! In fact, after relating almost every event he chose to describe in the book, he ends up saying something like, \\"This did nothing to contribute to my education.\\"The last major event he talks about in the book is the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904. After visiting the fair and seeing the prototypes of the new inventions that would dominate the social and technological changes in the developed world during the 20th century, he concludes that time has passed him by and that there will be no room for people like him in the future. The reader may well wonder why he didn't reach the same conclusion about the era in which he lived his life, since he seems to have stood outside the scene of action, puzzling over the meanings of the events.If your interest is 19th-century American history, there are scores of better books. If your interest is in biography, there are hundreds, and probably thousands, of better biographies. If your interest is education, almost any competently written book ever written on the subject will be more thought-provoking than this one is.And this is the greatest non-fiction book of the twentieth century?

This private account was not released commercially until after Adams's death, in 1918, when it became a best-seller and won the Pulitzer Prize.Many scholars and critics, as well as Adams himself, view \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" as a sequel to his earlier book, \\"Mont Sant Michel and Chartres\\" (also privately printed). Indeed, the posthumous edition of the later work opens with an Editor's Preface (signed by Lodge, but presumptuously written by Adams himself) in which the author proposes subtitles for each volume: respectively, \\"A Study of Twentieth-Century Multiplicity\\" and \\"A Study of Thirteenth-Century Unity.\\" While the two works are certainly linked thematically, they are not companion works in the traditional sense: \\"Mont Sant Michel\\" is a personal examination of medieval institutional and cultural history, while the \\"Education\\" is Adams's reckoning of his own involvement in international diplomatic affairs and intellectual circles. In other words, one can safely and profitably read one book without reading the other.So what is this difficult-to-categorize book about? Reduced to its simplest level, it recounts how an \\"eighteenth-century American boy\\" grew up during the nineteenth century, only to be intimidated and awed by the chaos of the twentieth. The unity of earlier ages, when everything revolved around God and Church, had been exploded into limitless possibilities by the discoveries of science and the advent of democracy, and Adams realized that \\"the child born in 1900 would then be born into a new world which would be not a unity but a multiple.\\"This somewhat obvious yet essential theme aside, the joy of this book for many readers is Adams's sardonic wit and his penchant for aphorisms; the number of quotable quotes is both delightful and exhausting. A notorious name-dropper, he knows everyone, and offers an insider's account of the most important events of the nineteenth century, volunteering his views on international diplomacy, monetary policy, evolutionary biology, and other matters.Adams portrays the journey of his life as an ongoing attempt at educating himself, yet he disdainfully learned that formal education was useless and that his dabbling had brought him to a dead end. \\"Religion, politics, statistics, travel had thus far led to nothing.... Accidental education could go no further, for one's mind was already littered and stuffed beyond hope with the millions of chance images stored away without order in the memory. One might as well try to educate a gravel-pit.\\"Of course, Adams's self-effacing protests of ignorance are often little more than a pose. His sense of innate blueblood superiority can be grating--a stance exaggerated by his writing about himself in the third person. He repeatedly (and backhandedly) reminds the reader how, as stupid as he might be, he is in good company: \\"Adams knew only that he would have felt himself on a more equal footing with them had he been less ignorant.\\" \\"Lincoln, Seward, Sumner, and the rest, could give no help to the young man seeking education; they knew less than he.\\" \\"Ridiculous as he knew himself about to be in his new role, he was less ridiculous than his betters.\\" One of the most unintentionally satisfying sections of this book, then, is when Adams finds himself among true aristocrats in England--and they dismiss him as a social inferior.As even Adams's biographer Ernest Samuels and Adams specialist John Carlos Rowe both acknowledge, the \\"Education\\" is an extraordinarily challenging work. Writing for his friends, Adams assumed a familiarity with arcane historical details about such affairs as American-Confederate-British diplomatic machinations during the Civil War, the Gold Scandal of 1869, and John Hay's role in developing China's Open Door Policy. Even the annotations provided by standard commercial editions may not be enough for many readers to flesh out what Adams is talking about.If there ever was a book that requires a study aid, this is it. Assuming you can overcome the common predisposition against such guides, you will discover that CliffNotes provides, in a useful narrative form, the necessary historical and biographical background--although it is certainly no substitute for the wit and wisdom of the work itself. And, for those who finish reading the book and want to fill in the gaps, the more scholarly \\"New Essays on The Education of Henry Adams\\" (edited by Rowe) offers additional valuable insights with a minimum of jargon."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I can only laugh, to hear the reports of students being required to read Adams. If there is one thing I am certain, it is that Adams would not appreciate being assigned. &quot;The Education&quot; is intended for those real students whose *desire* is learning. I put special emphasis on *desire*, not for the sake of being pompous, but to distinguish this type of desire as being self-motivated. Adams &quot;Education&quot; is a tremendous rebuttal to the ordinary, institutionalized education. There is little doubt as to the socio-economic benefits and sensibilities of formal education, but one should also recognize its inherent limitations. People seldom enjoy what they are forced to do! Adams' &quot;Education&quot; is not to be read as a classic, or because well-read people discuss it over coffee...rather, read it because you're curious. If you've forgotten that school and education are distinct, let Mr. Adams show you the difference. And well meaning teachers of the world.....Phuhleease, don't require Mr. Adams, as you will ruin the experience. --One last note; I think the other reviewers miss the boat when they call Adams cynical and depressing. This is not cynicism, but wit-big difference. For cynicism see Sinclair Lewis' Babbit(which you shouldnt assign either I might add). As far as depressing, I just don't get that at all. It was patently obvious to this reader that Mr. Adams' high-mindedness and detachment were toungue and cheek. In writing his &quot;Education&quot; Mr. Adams, no doubt, enjoyed himself...and while reading it, so will you."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Dear Stefi, Now that there is a slight lull in the happy Chestertown merry-go-round, I want to write a paragraph or two explaining why &lt;The Education of Henry Adams&gt; is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. This is why it is so interesting: It was written about 1906 and covers U.S. intellectual and political history from about 1860 to 1906. What is clever about it is the cynical, humorous sophistication (very unAmerican) with which he, an insider, regards all of these events. The book, like Montaigne or Rousseau's &lt;Confessions&gt; is an autobiography and, like Montaigne, Adams is of the view that life should above all be amusing, so that any great enterprise should be undertaken only if it is indeed amusing. The driving idea of the book, however, is where to find the truth (you guessed it--he is still searching on the last page). The places where he searches are very intriguing. He begins at Harvard, where, says he, he learned nothing from books and only one thing from the classes: how to get up and talk in front of large crowds of people about nothing. He was required to do this routinely, and his speeches were, like everyone else's, greeted with hissing and criticisms, so he learned not to expect approbation from an audience. Adams got heavily into the debate about evolution (Darwin being the hot topic at the end of the nineteenth century), because he thought it was the main amusement of his era. His position on evolution is &quot;reversion&quot; rather than progress. One of his proofs is a comparison of George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant. He admired Washington (a great general who became a great president); he voted for Grant (a great general). He knew personally the members of Grant's cabinet, thieves or incompetents at best. QED: things are getting worse not better. In his old age (sixty), after many other amusements of a busy lifetime, he decided to do what I did at the age of twenty-two: to visit all the important medieval French cathedrals. (In 1958, I bought a car in Saarbrucken--VW bug--and drove to seventeen of the greatest cathedrals, Guide Michelin in hand, staying at the youth hostels.) His book is peppered with well-digested quotations from French literature; he apparently knew it from top to bottom. His goal was to understand the Middle Ages (unity in the Virgin) and to write two books, one about the unity of the Middle Ages (title: &lt;Chartres and Mont Saint Michel&gt;) and another about the diversity of the twentieth century, &lt;The Education of Henry Adams&gt;. Adam's book has a number of difficult spots (confusing original philosophy and historical references that mean something only to the well-informed historian), but the good parts are worth going on to find. I hope this vignette will persuade you to get through the boring chapters at the beginning of the book on his childhood in Quincy. The narrative becomes interesting only with his stories about the Court of Saint James where he spent his early twenties as a diplomat during the U.S. Civil War. From that point on, I think you will love it as much as I did. Cheers! Claire"},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"I was intrigued by this book because it is almost universally considered to be the best non-fiction book ever written. I went into the book with an open mind and eagerness but ultimately found myself a bit disappointed.Henry Adams was a member of the preeminent American Adams family (John and John Quincy were his great-grandfather and grandfather). Henry's autobiography follows his uniquely privileged life from childhood through old age as Henry witnesses (and always comments on) the ever-changing American experience and perpetually seeks to refine and further his understanding of the world around him. This relentless pursuit of \\"education\\" is the connective theme within the autobiography, as Henry continually considers and reconsiders the rapid scientific, technological, economic and political changes that swept through America and the world during his life. Ultimately, through these experiences and reflections, Henry comes to important conclusions about the role of education, learning and life experiences.This book is filled with historical references and names from Henry's time period, making the book fascinating for someone who is interested in that period (mid 19th to early 20th Centuries). I personally did not find these references interesting and in several cases, I felt confused or lost because I completely missed important references. The strength of the book is Henry's always sharp observation and clever wit.I think this would be a great book for those interested in Henry's time period or for those interested more broadly in American history. As someone with only peripheral interests in these areas, I found the book to be a little bit out of my league. People interested in this historical period will find this book quite rewarding though don't read it simply because it is supposed to be great-- for that would be an affront to Henry's belief in self-motivated education."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Its funny how some reading experiences emcompass more than just the book itself. In the case of Henry Adams autobiographical essay collection, The Education of Henry Adams, I always think of a sunny day in the park. The first time I read the book I was still in High School and believed that I had an obligation to read all those books that had been identified as &quot;classics&quot;. This was one. I read most of it one afternoon while sitting under a large oak tree in Shelby Park in Nashville, TN. I remember contrasting the gloom and pessimism of Adams thought with the sunny day and the optimistic prospects I believed the future held for me. I argued with him as I read. I thought his reaction to Darwin, for example, was misplaced and in bad faith. I thoroughly disagreed with his argument in the chapter &quot;The Virgin and the Dynamo&quot;; I felt I knew enough about the Middle Ages to prefer living in a time of electric lights, running water, medical science and imperfect democracy than in a hovel in some Medieval village dominated by King and the Roman Catholic Church. I dismissed Henry Adams as a whiner and an educated misfit who had nothing to say to me.Its also funny how the passage of time changes one's perceptions. Rereading the book a couple of decades later I was surprised to find how much Adams and I had in common. I still didn't agree with his particular nostalgia for a time he had never experienced except in his imagination, but his sense of loss, of powerlessness, of the world slipping into some dangerous entropic state, all rang true to me. I also had read enough history of the 19th Century to appreciate more his many insightful anecdotes of the period. The subtlety of his humor and the richness of his writing style I also found appealing. I found this reading to be a much more rewarding experience - and I can't tell you a thing about where I was at the time, except deeply into the book."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"The title of &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; sounds like an autobiography, but the book is really about the development of a man's conscience and theory of human history, using the world events of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a backdrop and a laboratory. Henry Adams -- whose great grandfather was John Adams, the second American President, and whose grandfather obviously was John Quincy Adams, the sixth -- is more than just a presidential legacy; he reveals himself to be a great thinker and writer, the brilliance of his &quot;Education&quot; ensuring him a permanent place in the American canon.The book has a few attributes that distinguish it from a typical autobiography. The most noticeable is that Adams writes in the third, not first, person. He repeats the word &quot;education&quot; like a mantra throughout the book, referring to it in its literal, not formal, sense: the &quot;bringing up&quot;, or development, of a person's mind, manner, and outlook. The narrative is very personal and is not, as some may expect, a rigid historical perspective, although it does offer plenty of commentary on contemporary historical and political events, from the Civil War to two presidential assassinations (Lincoln's and McKinley's, but not Garfield's) to the Industrial Revolution's impact on the American commercial landscape.Adams writes like a novelist, and this book reads like a novel. His lyrical prose is all the more amazing because it seems like a product of the very education he finds so evasive. Growing up in Quincy, Massachussetts, he hated school; he even confesses that he got little to nothing out of his years at Harvard. Always hopeful to be educated by new experiences, he serves as a secretary to his father, an ambassador, in London during the American Civil War, where he learns about diplomacy from high-ranking British politicians. He proceeds to dabble in various arts and sciences, start a career in journalism, and become an instructor at Harvard, noting the irony of teaching while still searching for his own education.Throughout the book we get a very vivid picture of Adams as an idiosyncratic mixture of humanism, modesty, shyness, erudition, and a polite sort of cynicism. He has a rather socratic tendency to dismiss all the previous knowledge he has collected as worthless for his continuing education, resolving to start from scratch with a new source. A curious omission in the book is the twenty-year period in which his marriage ends with his wife's suicide; perhaps this event was just too painful to write about, because it's difficult to believe that this experience could not have influenced the pursuit of his education.If Adams's education can be said to have a culmination, it is in his development of a &quot;dynamic theory of history,&quot; in which he compares physical forces (gravity, magnetism) acting on a body to historical forces, produced by the conflict of the sciences (&quot;The Dynamo&quot;) against the arts (&quot;The Virgin&quot;), acting on man. With this initiative Adams embodies the nineteenth century American intellectual and political conscience: He proves in this book that he was a greatly informed man, but also that he was wise because he understood the difference between information and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"This books stands apart in autobiographies. Unlike autobiographies written in vanity at the crest of success, this one is written as a melancholic meditation on life, at the crest of what Henry Adams thought was his failure. Adams always refers to himself in third person and in the humorous and abject epithets giving the autobiography the character of a novel or a biography.Henry Adams, was a historian, journalist and political private secretary, with intrests as varied as physics, chemistry, geology, evolution, mathematics, politics, history, and diplomacy. He was the son of a diplomat, Charles Francis Adams. His grand-father was John Quincy Adams the 6th president of USA and great-grand father was John Adams, the 2nd president.Despite being one of the greatest American historians, with a successful career in history, journalism and literature, Adams regarded himself as a failure because he was inconsequential in politics and society as compared to his forefathers and his education based on eighteenth century principles of the founding fathers of USA, imparted through his relatives, peers, school, socity and the Harvard College, was unsuitable to meet the challenges of the world he was to grow into - the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Adams believed that the law of acceleration of forces in history lead to a situation where a person trained for a certain level of complexity finds himself at the mercy of forces of a higher complexity as he grows up. This was his theory of history, intimately derived from his experience of life.He felt that all education through parents, school, college, work or life can never in its entirety prepare a person for life, because the society around you changes at an accelerating pace while your education rooted in your parents values and the value of the soceity of your childhood becomes obsolete by the time you need to put it to use. So at each stage of life man always needs to begin his education anew.The merit of this books goes beyond just and insight into education, life or failure. It also illuminates the time from 1838 to 1905. Adams was close to political, literary, artistic and scientific circles in Europe and America and travelled far and wide visiting England, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Egypt, Mexico and Cuba, some of these countries again and again.The books is rich in literary style and historical, literary, scientific, cultural, economic and sociological insights as it analyzes self, peoples, times and cultures."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"Henry Adams managed to become a Modernist late in life. He was 62 years old at the turn of the century and a bit older when he wrote this memoir and yet his prose is crisp, direct and penetrating like that of Aldous Huxley rather like that of say Charles Dickens. I found myself re-reading passages of this books immediately after finishing them, purely to admire the beauty of expression. Adams is epigrammatic, conveying humor and wisdom with economy and an amazing sense of rhythm.The content of this book is fascinating. His observations of 'New England character' early on are, to my mind, dead on, although it may be so that he actually invented this perspective on New Englanders. In either case it matches my post-Modern experience of the place and its people. Adams' insistence on treating all of life's events as either learning experiences or conscious wastes of time is an attitude that I suppose I've always had, but never 'brought to consciousness'. He is very tough on formal education, but one needs to be or it rapidly becomes a waste of time.His application of the third person to his own self is very effective. He considers himself to have been essentially a pawn of history because of his pedigree. His use of this simple literary device detaches the character portrayed from the narrator and has the effect of leaving Adams adrift in the narrative of his own life. Other reviewers have actually complained that he does not deal with the suicide of his wife in this book. This is not true. He pointed stops the chronological narrative immediately before his marriage and picks it up several years later after she is dead. In a painful but enigmatic passage he describes daily visiting the statue that St. Gaudens designed for her grave and being angry that it has become a tourist attraction. There is much else expressed there, but I would have to re-read it to understand all of it, but I do know that the sadness is practically palpable on the page.I can not say that I accept his 'law of history' related in the penultimate chapter of the book, but it has made me want to pick up his brother Brooks' book, The Law of Civilization and Decay, that has long sat on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"\\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" is a difficult book to review. But be forewarned: \\"The Education\\" will not appeal to many readers. It is hardly a book you'd bring to the beach or try to read for leisure. I first came across the book in a foreign policy seminar I took in college. While my professor took great pains to tell us how important \\"The Education\\" was -- it was named by Modern Library as the greatest non-fiction book written in the 20th Century -- the book was just boring to a 19-year, and almost certainly beyond my limited means and interest. Recently inspired by a blog series on the New York Times web site about \\"The Education\\", I decided to dust off my old copy, hoping that a few years wiser, I would be able to get through the whole thing, and even more importantly, have a better appreciation for Adams' book. After finally finishing it -- including the many detailed footnotes in the Samuel' edition -- I can safely say that while several parts of the book were very interesting, I would not recommend \\"The Education\\" to everyone.\\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" is for all intents and purposes, a very unusual autobiography of Adams -- though I am sure Adams would disagree with that label -- told in the third person, chronicling the interesting life of a man born into an extraordinary family history, who led a fascinating life, but who never quite fit into the changing America as the 20th Century began to dawn. Henry Adams was a historian and one-time professor of history at Harvard. Born in 1838, Adams was the great-grandson of John Adams, the grandson of John Quincy Adams, and the son of Charles Francis Adams, the esteemed Minster to England during the Civil War. The book is written in such a manner that each chapter covers a year or series of years in Adams' life, beginning in 1838 and ending in 1905 (though Adams himself died in 1918, he ended the book in 1905; further, the book does not cover the 20-year period of his marriage to Marion \\"Clover\\" Hooper, who tragically killed herself in 1885 following a long depression).Part of what makes \\"The Education\\" so compelling -- at least to me, is that the book serves as an eyewitness account of some of the most important events and periods of American history between 1840 and 1900. Adams offers very insightful and sharp observations of many of the great events of his time; though, it is important to note that Adams was in Britain for the entire Civil War, serving as a private secretary to his father, so Adams does not offer great analysis of what was going on in America during the Civil War. Perhaps not coincidentally, some of the most boring chapters in \\"The Education\\" are those covering the years 1860 to 1870.More than anything else, however, \\"The Education\\" is a story of a man who felt out of place in the fast-changing America of the late-19th and early 20th Century. From Adams' perspective, the book is a tale of his pursuit of an \\"education\\" in life that would help him adapt to, understand, and live in the new America. Throughout the book, Adams laments his abject failure in accomplishing this objective, and generally considered himself a failure unable to live in the United States as it entered onto the world stage as a super power. Reading the book, it was very interesting to me how Adams conceived himself as a man of the 18th Century, and I think his inability to live up to the political successes of his ancestors -- who could?! -- was hugely depressing to him as he went through life.\\"The Education\\" has several chapters on numerous recurring themes which Adams well examines and often lampoons, such as American politics and the U.S. Senate (his chapters on the pitiful Grant Administration and the state of U.S. politics are extremely funny and pretty much on-the-mark, even 130 years later), the conduct of diplomacy (given Adams' family history and his own interests, he had a tremendous background in diplomatic issues, and was best friends with Secretary of State John Hay), and the rise of technology and its affect on the United States (his chapters on the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and the 1900 Paris Exposition are two of the best chapters in the book). Regarding the latter area, Adams was both intrigued by and terrified of emerging technologies like the faster locomotives, cars, and other devices, which he called the \\"dynamo\\". In several passages, he predicted that while new technologies would advance civilization and America's standing, they would also reap devastating results for the world. Given the birth of the Atomic Age and what has happened since, one could argue that Adams was incredibly prescient.Despite the book's many pluses, it is not without its considerable flaws. Perhaps I am just not educated enough myself, but the book is extremely hard to read today. First written by Adams around 1903, \\"The Education\\" does not all translate well to 2008, and I had to read many of the passages and pages multiple times to understand what Adams was trying to say. Further, while Adams' wit and self-deprecating humor are amusing at first, it becomes very grating as Adams seems to refer to himself as a failure on every single page. Finally, there are certain periods of Adams' life -- particularly his lack of service during the Civil War and his marriage (which he does not mention once in the book) -- which he disappointingly did not discuss much at all.As I mentioned at the beginning of my review, \\"The Education\\" is not a book for everyone. It takes a good deal of time to fully read and digest, and its themes are fairly nuanced and not always terribly exciting. That being said, if you're a student of history and interested in learning about American development between 1840 and 1900 from one of the 19th Century's great historians (Adams wrote a nine-volume history of the U.S. during the Jefferson and Madison Administrations, which, to this day are considered the gold standard in early American history books), you should consider checking the book out. If you do want to read \\"The Education\\", I strongly recommend that you purchase Ernest Samuel's edition. Samuels wrote a three-volume biography of Adams, and knew more about Henry Adams than anybody else. Samuels also included a wealth of detailed footnotes throughout the pages; while many people like to avoid footnotes, they are quite valuable with a book like this where Adams is constantly referencing old German words and 15th Century French figures as if his readers were all supposed to know them! So, the Samuels edition (the one with the green cover and published by Riverside Editions) is the edition you want.I liked \\"The Education\\" and I would like very much to read his forgotten histories of the Jefferson and Madison years, but I have to admit that I don't know if I could ever make it through them considering Adams' writing style!Three stars."},{"Title":"The Education of Henry Adams; An Autobiography","review":"This is one of the great American books. The scion of one of America's most patrician families tells the story of his education. And his education is the story of his disillusionment with the time and world he comes to live in, and his idealization of a long lost medieval world. The Virgin of the medieval Catholic vision which represents for Adams an organic harmony is opposed and contradicted by the Dynamo of his own world. And that Dynamo is of scientific and technological progress accelerating at such an intense pace that the sense of the world, the center falls apart . And the Adams born to the heart of America's founding elite feels himself increasingly not at home in the world. The majestic tone, the third person narrative, the whole detached way he tells his own story prevents the reader from the most intense kind of sympathy with him. And yet his vision of a world somehow come apart in going too far and too fast in directions we do not understand does speak to us today.There are of course other aspects of the richness of the work, including the insight into the political worlds of the Washington of his time.But there is too a sense of an elite observer for whom the America of successive waves of immigration is not the real America . And there is a sense of Miniver Cheevy child of scorn cursing the day that he was born, of that is the ' old- line aristrocat ' who feel these new and other Americans have stolen his home and place from him.This is a work which much can be learned , and which certainly has much to be admired in it intellectually.

And it's a great, fun and very informative read for anyone interested in how the major label record business really works.This book is fact filled, but wrapped in drama, humor and poignancy as we see how real, talented musicians deal with the ups and downs of the business side of rock stardom. It is also a good view of pop culture in the 1970s.The author takes us inside the music business, up close, giving us a blow-by-blow, true-life account of a year in the life of the band Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen, a mid-tier rock band poised on the brink of greatness. It's a story of drama, comedy, pathos and heartbreak as we see the band members work their way through (and be worked by) the \\"star-making machinery\\" of the record business.We are taken into the recording studio numerous times and see what a major label recording session is like and how it feels to be a musician involved in it all. We go into meetings with record company executives.

This work, suitable for preteens on up, gives vivid life-portraits of four of Christendom's most colorful and prolific hymn writers.Phillips, as she did so well with her \\"Heroes\\" treatments of Billy Sunday, Frederick Douglass and Saint Augustine, once again weaves historical and personal details together to give us very human characters. Horatio Spafford, whose intrepid efforts for Christ and His church during the era of D.L. Moody and the Great Chicago Fire, suffered the dark tragedy of losing four young daughters during their Atlantic crossing with his wife in the Ville du Havre disaster of 1873. Phillips delves into the wells of Spafford's emotions as he wrestled with this and other spiritual challenges that resulted in such important hymn poems as \\"It Is Well with My Soul.\\"I think it laudable that this biographer doesn't shrink from mentioning such unfortunate and unflattering details as the petty and uncharitable treatment Spafford and others received from fellow churchmen, as well as Spafford's own idiosyncrasies which surfaced later in his life. But the inclusion of such blemishes is always seasoned by Phillips' compassion and charm with which she sums up her subjects' true greatness, namely their faith in a God of unfailing grace and providence.Other stories in this very readable volume tell about Phillip P. Bliss (\\"Hallelujah! What a Savior\\"), William Cowper (\\"God Moves in a Mysterious Way\\") and Frances Ridley Havergal (\\"Take My Life and Let It Be\\").

(It was left to Michael Holroyd to give George Bernard Shaw his due.) While this volume is a sophisticated, wide-ranging, scholarly biography, it also brims with Wilde's wit and bold life, which, as Oscar himself pointed out, was where his genius lay. The slow, steady accumulation of detail, allusion and anecdote pays off as Wilde reaches his pinnacle--the original production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;--only to plunge into the abyss of imprisonment. As Wilde tempts fate with rough trade dalliances and his ill-conceived challenge to the Marquess of Queensbury, you find yourself almost shouting out for him to stop and save himself. But he doesn't, because Ellmann makes us understand that Wilde's nature led him to that point. The end is sad, but his wit never deserts him, right up until his death throes when he notes that either the wallpaper in the room must go or he must--which he does shortly thereafter. Today, qualities that Wilde pioneered are a part of modern life: camp humor, scathing put-downs, an emphasis on style, an obsession with appearances. In Wilde's day, he was an almost solitary figure in that regard, leading the way into the modern world. The witticisms of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; are as humorous and apt today as the day they were first spoken in London in 1895. Richard Ellmann helps us understand why."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"If Richard Ellmann had not already written the definitive literary biography (his astonishing JAMES JOYCE), this utterly first-rate biography would be a legitimate candidate for the title. One might initially think that Wilde would be an easy subject for a biography: his life was interesting, eventful, literarily significant, triumphant, and tragic. But the problem is that for many Wilde has become a symbol either of the late 19th century Victorian decadence or the oppressed homosexual. To treat anyone, and especially Wilde, primarily as a symbol or a representative of anything outside himself, is to distort and misrepresent. The genius of Ellmann's biography of Wilde is that Wilde never becomes either more or less than the writer and person Oscar Wilde.The portrait that emerges of Wilde is absolutely fascinating. If Ellmann's JAMES JOYCE is the greater biography, Wilde emerges nonetheless as the more interesting of the two Irish authors, and perhaps the more brilliant, if not the more productive. Indeed, one of the things that emerges from Ellmann's book is a sense that Wilde might have become a greater writer than he did, and not just if he had not sued the Marquess of Queensbury and had not been sent to prison on sodomy charges. Wilde emerges as even more brilliant than the work he produced, as if he had produced much of his work with a minimum of reference.Ellmann does a marvelous job of situation Wilde in his time and place, with the cultural and artistic concerns paramount at the time. He also does a fair and just job of depicting the major involvements in his life, beginning with Whistler and his wife Constance and continuing on with his various involvements, especially with Alfred Lord Douglas. With the latter, Ellmann certainly does not try to idealize the relationship, but recounts it warts and all. If there is a villain in the book, it is not, surprisingly, the Marquess of Queensbury, but his son Lord Douglas.The saddest part of the book, by far, is the section recounting Wilde's life after leaving prison, which is one disappointment after another. He first intended to reunite and reconcile with his wife, but she unexpectedly died, thereby cutting himself off from both a family and his children. He then reunites uncomfortably with Lord Douglas, but the attempt is a disaster. He final year or two are recounted as being especially miserable, with an impoverished Wilde reduced to conversing entertainingly with strangers for the benefit of a drink. It is especially heartbreaking to read how almost all his former friends cut him off, refusing to help him in his time of greatest need. An encounter with a young man from Arkansas provides perhaps the most apt Wilde quote from his last days. Upon hearing about Arkansas, Wilde remarked, \\"I would like to flee like a wounded hart into Arkansas.\\"One learns a vast amount of fascinating biographical detail about Wilde's life from this book. For instance: Wilde was double-jointed, could speed read and knock off books in scarcely more than a half hour in some instances. He was acquainted with the Yeats family in Ireland, and spoke with a pronounced Irish accent until he went to Oxford. He bought Thomas Carlyle's writing desk. He was a Mason. Physically he had tiny feet and teeth that were darkened by mercury treatments. And there is much, much more.On nearly every level, this is a truly great biography. Even if one is not a fan of Wilde's works, it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"I bought this book after seeing the movie, &quot;Wilde&quot; which is based on it. I have to say that I caught a bit of &quot;Oscar Fever&quot; while reading it. The book is incredibly thorough and well-researched; Ellman definitely knows his stuff. The book is written in an admiring, respectful tone but remains objective. Excerpts from Wilde's works that the author found particularly significant are included, as well as many wonderful pictures.After reading this book I have a lot of admiration and fondness for Wilde, and I marvel at his fascinating but ultimately tragic life. A couple of months before I read this book I was wandering around the cemetery de Pere-Lachaise in Paris and happened upon Wilde's grave. I didn't think too much of it then but now that I have learned a bit about the man I really do want to go back and pay my respects. Ellman has written a beautiful, loving portrait of Wilde and it is thoroughly enjoyable and poignant. I'd also recommend the wonderful film starring Stephen Fry and Jude Law but to get the whole story, read the book!!!"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Oscar Wilde was a man of paradoxes, both a man completely of his time and ahead of his time. He is also one of the most interesting, and tragic, literary figures of all-time. In our age of \\"information quick\\" (though it was the same in his own age), Wilde is often misunderstood (both his life and his works.) It's easy to get a one-sided version of Wilde the writer, or Wilde the man. That is why this extremely well-written, Pulitzer Prize-winning, masterpiece of a biography is absolutely essential for the Wilde scholar or the Wilde fan. Ellman skillfully avoids what he could've so easily done, and what so many other have done: write a sensational, tabloidistic account of Wilde's remarkable and scandalous life. Instead, he carefully, skillyfully - and, not least important, lovingly - assembles a neat balance between the sensational elements of Wilde's remarkable life and his literary legacy. Wilde, whose works are often dismissed (despite being probably the most widely quoted source in the world outside of The Bible and Shakespeare, and despite having his works widely and frequently plagarized) because of his lifestyle, and Ellman thankfully gives him his due here. Thanks to people like Ellman, Wilde's literary works rest now, finally, where they are due: at the top of the pantheon. He also goes a long way towards explaining the underlying motives behind Wilde's seemingly self-conscious descent into oblivion. Wilde, to the casual observer, seems almost to have been on a deliberate mission of artistic and personal suicide, and Ellman goes a long way here towards explaining his motives. As Wilde himself said, his life itself was his greatest work of art - it's very moving and incredibly tragic to watch his spectacular meteoric rise and even more spectacular fall, leading into his amazing decline, disgrace, and exile. One of the most famous men of his time in the 1890's, it's incredible to see how totally Wilde was shunned after his imprisonment. However, with the passage of more than a century - in which tolerance has made great bounds, both for gays and for the expulsion of literary censorship - Wilde's star can hardly be said to have ever shined brighter. Every year brings a new movie adaptation of one his plays (a movie of this book was even made a few years ago), his plays are still being staged, and his books are still widely read and discussed - not to mention that he is one of the most widely quoted invididuals in the English language. One may still well question Wilde's wanton ways and his decision to face the music, even when it was obvious and inevitable that he was going to lose both his reputation and possibly his life - but remember only what one W.B. Yeats has said of Wilde: \\"I never for a moment thought that he made the wrong decision\\" - Wilde, who lavished and delighted in pointing out the hypocrisy of his age and society won the right, by submitting to it, to critize it more. Now, a hundred years on, Wilde - poet, playwright, wit, and martyr to sexual mores - stands as tall as ever, a huge, larger-than-life, towering figure, his wit remaining, as Ellman says, \\"an agent of renewal.\\""},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Richard Ellmann obviously knew just about everything there was to know about Oscar Wilde; what is amazing is that he was able to put most of it in his Wilde biography and still make it a graceful, engrossing read completely free of boredom or didacticism. Wilde was one of the truly great personalities of all time, and Ellmann not only brings him to vivid life, but demonstrates why he was one of the most important literary figures of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"This really is a wonderful book. Ellmann seems to know just about everything regarding Wilde (save for the \\"syphillis thesis,\\" about which I'll make a brief note in a moment). Ellmann absolutely loves his subject matter, both the man and the era, and his enthusiasm energizes the entire book. Additionally, the prose here is very, very good: you won't find many better stylists than Ellmann...he writes with clarity and verve, and careful readers will regularly briefly stop to re-read and re-enjoy many of Ellmann's passages.Regarding the so-called \\"syphillis thesis\\": Ellmann claims, certainly incorrectly, that Wilde contracted syphillis while a young man, and that this condition later contributed to his death. I mention this point merely because some critics have used this error to discredit the entire biography, which is ridiculous. The strengths of the book far, far outweight particular errors. Some other critics have claimed that Ellmann plays down Wilde's homosexuality, which is another absurd claim. Ellmann notes at one point that homosexuality fired Wilde's imagination and served as an important inspiration for Wilde, both artistically and, for lack of a better word, \\"politically.\\" (Wilde was not a notably \\"political\\" figure in the conventional sense).At any rate: if you've got an interest in Wilde, by all means buy this book. It will heighten your enthusiasm for Wilde, AND it's a wonderfully written book in its own right."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"This book is an invaluable resource for those wanting an exhaustive account of the life of Oscar Wilde. The author takes great pains to balance his detailing of the personal accounts of Wilde's life with his literary legacy and does so as to be stimulating without seeming prurient. If you're wanting a superficial, glossy, tabloid portrayal of Wilde pass on this, if you're desiring something more this is it."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"This is a intelligent, absorbing and profound biography of a Literary Genius written with illuminating psichological insights relating his works his psiquis and social environment. Done with love and humanity I recommend this biography without reserves. The canvas Ellman paints of the epoch is accurate and makes the reader re-live 1800s' fin de siecle."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Imagine the challenges facing a Wilde biographer: the contradictions of an outrageous, larger-than-life subject whose brittle public persona masked his inner torments; Wilde's enormous drive, which led to success and acclaim, but also set in motion his ultimate fall from grace. Worse: so much already written, including Wilde's own glittering one-liners - what could anyone presume to add to the already crowded record?Professor Ellmann, who worked for almost twenty years on this book, doesn't fail to deliver. In what will clearly be the definitive biography, he lays out details of Wilde's life, illuminates the work, and cuts through the brilliant and brittle public persona to show us Wilde's soul. All of this is accomplished with wit, intelligence and compassion -- this book confirmed Ellmann's status as the English professor I always wished I'd had. Professor Ellmann doesn't make a single misstep in this astonishing biography.His final assessment of Wilde:\\"He belongs to our world more than to Victoria's. Now, beyond the reach of scandal, his best writings validated by time, he comes before us still, a towering figure, laughing and weeping, with parables and paradoxes, so generous, so amusing, and so right.\\"If I may be forgiven a paraphrase of Ellmann's own words, this biography is also \\"generous, amusing, and so right.\\""},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"It is obvious that Ellman is passionate about Oscar Wilde. It appears to be well researched, unfortunately this leads to a rather trudging first two-thirds. The last third reads a lot easier, and in my opinion makes up for the rather stilted writing that started off the book. If you are at all interested in the life of Oscar Wilde you should read this book."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"I couldn't believe the depths Ellmann takes the reader in his biography of Oscar Wilde. Everything; every aspect of Wilde's life is thoroughly explored.

Even to this day it's probably the most erudite biography I've ever read. The scholarly weight and depth of this book is tremendous. It is amazingly comprehensive. This is the kind of book that takes 20 years to write and must be a labor of love for the writer--the writer must really love his subject, in this case, Wilde. And one has every indication from the book that Richard Ellman did. His portrait of Wilde is no less sympathetic as it is complete. This must be the definitive biography which all other Wilde bios should be measured against. A superlative achievement.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"This biography needed a lot of research. It is very interesting for people who'd like to know more about Oscar Wilde and the astonishing and complicated story of its life."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"After reading this book, I cannot help but review Oscar Wilde, the man and his life, as if it were a work of art in itself, as much as I can this biography of Wilde as depicted by Richard Ellmann. Wilde, as much as any historical figure, certainly as much as any creative figure, speaks loudly as an artifact of the age he embodied and from which he was consumed and discarded and as a creative figure whose own life was arguably a greater work of art than anything he ever wrote or said.Before addressing Wilde, let's evaluate Ellman's book on its own merits. He presents everything you ever wanted to know about Oscar Wilde and then some. Admittedly, the voluminous number of acquaintances, companions and foes whose paths crossed with Wilde's is overwhelming and it requires a monumental juggling act to keep track of all the players and how they intersect with each other and revolve around Wilde, the sun of this biographical solar system. Ellmann does an admirable job of this, although I was lost quite frequently and had to backtrack to find the first mention of an individual to identify the original relation to Wilde and draw a line in my mind between an individual once kindly disposed toward him and the person that ostracized and avoided him during and after his disgrace.One might view the ordeal and persecution of Wilde in the 19th century and conclude that he could live very openly and comfortably in the 21st century where gay and bisexual characters appear daily in all forms of media. That would seem to be an erroneous interpretation when one sees that Wilde was inextricably linked to the time and culture in which he lived. He was a product of Victorian England and he, by design as well as circumstance, paid the price for bringing an aspect of human sexuality and behavior to the unavoidable attention of a society that dared not think of, much less, speak the name of the abomination which Wilde represented to them.Wilde's creativity, imagination and wit were all intertwined with his identity as provocateur, even as he sought the favor of respectable society. He felt compelled to seek out the \`nameless' side of human nature, specifically in a mutually destructive relationship with a powder keg of a young man, Lord Alfred Douglas. At the same time in which Oscar was fulfilling his authentic identity, that vehicle for his liberation was also the route to his undoing and downfall from the heights of success. Wilde could probably have saved himself from prison by following the advice of his long-suffering but tolerant wife Constance and his loyal friend Robbie Ross and living in exile in another country. However, he could not run. Staying and fighting, even if it led to prison was in his constitution and had been instilled in him by his very litigious mother.Ellmann repeatedly refers to Wilde as a kind and considerate man and in many respects this is true. He was generous even when he was in dire financial straits himself and he lavished gifts and compliments in purple prose as if he possessed an endless supply of both. It appears to me, however, that his greatest sin, more so than any of his \`indecent' activities, was his neglect of his wife and children, the innocent victims of Oscar's hedonistic quest for self-fulfillment.Utimately, Oscar Wilde's greatest creation was \`Oscar Wilde', a work of art that overshadows even his greatest prose work, The Picture of Dorian Gray, as well as his greatest play, The Importance of Being Earnest. It perhaps surprised him as much as anyone else that the play of his life that he originally conceived as a comedy was quickly transformed in its final act into tragedy."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Ellmann's biography of Wilde is just about everything you can hope for: very richly detailed, extremely well written, and practically radiating with a love of the writer and his work. Wilde himself comes alive as a three dimensional figure, not an \\"icon\\" (and therefore, two dimensional figure) of any particular literary, social, or political movement. Too many critics have used Wilde for their own purposes and therefore diminished him. Ellmann respects Wilde--and the truth about Wilde--too much, and that integrity sets this book apart.As a bonus, Wilde's entire literary and social circle come to life, including of course the redoubtable Bosie and the poor choices Wilde made (especially in his foolish litigation against Bosie's father). As a whole, the book does have an emotional wallop, as Wilde's genuine genius pays off with literary success, but like his character Dorian Gray, there was a very unseemly reality beneath the glitter, which brought his career and finally his life to a terribly cruel end."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"The best biography I've read about Oscar Wilde .

No noted person in modern Western history quite had his mixture of the brilliant, the witty, the perceptive, the unconventional -- and the self-destructive. Oscar reached the sun, then plummeted, deflated by Victorian England's smug prejudices about homosexuality, and about those who practiced it openly. He achieved greatness as a poet, playwright and raconteur, while also cocking a clever and witty snook at authority. Society took its revenge on Wilde, making the last five years of his life a hell in varying degrees. But he maintained his dignity and his sense of humor, and refused to hate his tormentors.Richard Ellmann gives us a detailed, intense examination of Oscar Wilde's life -- the precocious son of a noted Dublin physician, and of a fiery exponent of Irish nationalism. Ellmann traces Wilde's journey up the ladder through college, the lecture circuit (he made an extensive tour of the United States in the early 1880s), his life as a raconteur and boulevardier who was always eloquent but often financially embarrassed. Oscar Wilde's poetry is dealt with at length, as are his other writings, including his novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" still well known today. And his handful of plays, culminating in his masterpiece \\"The Importance of Being Earnest,\\" also get a detailed examination by Ellmann.But Wilde, married at 30 to a lovely young woman and within two years the father of a couple of sons, followed his unconventional and -- many said -- amoral views to their logical conclusion. He began having sexual liaisons with boys and men. His ongoing love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas -- \\"Bosie\\" to his friends -- eventually led to his downfall, conviction in court of performing \\"indecent acts\\" with other men, according to the British statutes of that day; and serving a two-year sentence at hard labor.The last three years of Wilde's life -- from 1897 when he was released from prison, until his death in a sleazy Paris hotel in 1900 -- are sad indeed in Ellmann's telling. Wilde was shunned and \\"cut\\" repeatedly in public by many, many English people he happened to encounter in France. But he managed generally to maintain his dignity, and his good nature, despite increasing bouts of depression and self-medication with alcohol. He died at 46, killed partly by his own impulses, partly by the narrow-mindedness of British society of the 1890s.Richard Ellmann did a marvelous work in writing this biography of a unique individual. How sad that Ellmann himself died just months after finishing the book. He should have gotten to enjoy the laudatory reviews his work received."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"I first read Ellmann's \\"Oscar Wilde\\" shortly after it was published more than twenty years ago. Reading it again has proved even more a pleasure. Not only is this the definitive biography of Wilde, it is the definitive literary biography of anyone. Ellmann's deep understanding of Wilde and his ability re-create the times Wilde lived in renders passages that are often breathtaking. To be reading about the writing of \\"De Profundis\\" and \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\" on the same day that a judge struck down Proposition 8 made me think about how Wilde would have been regarded had he only lived twenty or thirty more years. A hundred and ten years after his death, he is even more relevant in so many ways. This book is beautiful, from the writing to the type to the binding. You can say of Wilde, Ellmann, the book itself: they don't make 'em like this anymore. Perhaps one of my ten favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Just as to know James Joyce, discover his daughter, the spark of his own genius.Lady Wilde was a writer and Irish revolutionary who raised her son to infiltrate the highest ranks of the empire and expose their foibles, faults, cruelties and hidden shames, which he so fully did through his theatre work and other writings. He was investigating the widespread homosexuality of the British aristocracy when he was arested for his prying and blamed for that which he himself investigated and reported. He was silenced through breaking imprisonment (read his post-prison poetry, and the uneven yet revelatory De Profundis written from prison) which debilitated, discouraged and killed him a few short years after his release.TO know Wilde, know his mother: Speranza, Lady Wilde, whose wonderful works of Irish history and legends are now available on amazon.com only in Spanish translation.

Find out far more about Wilde than the popular and shallow slander urgently promoted by the Empire"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"In Ellman's James Joyce, the question was on how this life created such works of genius but in Oscar Wilde the task was different and more focused on the artist having created a life that was itself a work of art and how that art was destroyed when that life was vilified.Before \\"Dorian Gray\\" or \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" it was Wilde's clothes, hair and demeanor that garnered mocking attention. In a Gilbert & Sullivan production called \\"Patience\\" Oscar Wilde's manner was sent up along with the Aesthetes, an arts movement all the rage in the 1870s Britain. Wilde capitalized and extended his notoriety with his very popular and talked about lecture tour of the United States in 1882. This was a decade before he produced his great works.What to make of Wilde's marriage? The book takes the marriage and Wilde's initial enthusiasm seriously but not too seriously. Lets face it, this was a time when marriage particularly in Wilde's strata was a social act nearly as much as a romantic one. Did Wilde understand his homosexuality before marrying Constance? Seems unlikely. But once married and having produced an heir, Wilde bored of it and then focused on love affairs and sexual dalliances with men.There is something inherently self destructive in Wilde. Yes, he had an outsized personality but early on he was subject to mockery, ridicule and disregard. He was flamboyant before that was even code for gay and before he was even \\"gay.\\" And once married, he risked exposure with his public behavior with young men, his private procurement of male prostitutes and most flagrantly with Alfred Douglas as he was so besotted as not to care anymore what people thought.I want to stop Wilde from suing Queensbury. It so provoked the establishment to turn on him and his dangerous notoriety. But reading this biography, I had the feeling if it hadn't Queensbury and that suit, it would have another person in another incident. Wilde was the most visible symbol of a homosexual movement that scared the British establishment that all its bright young men would end up queer. Someone had to be the scapegoat and thus it was Wilde.Reading about the last years of his life, particularly after he was released from prison is very difficult. The brightness, the confidence are gone. The begging, the wandering, the neediness for any attention so demeans this man of great intellect, wit and presence. And even though he died early, at 46 years of age, I felt as if he had died in prison, it would have been better, sparing Wilde and all of us the painful loss of everything because of who he loved. Despite his many great qualities, and literary masterpieces, Oscar Wilde was the poster child for shameful and degrading homosexuality that lasted through Stonewall and into our own day."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"I've read a couple of biographies of Oscar Wilde and this was hands down the best.

This author did a great job."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"Ellmann's portrait of Wilde--the Irish scholar, poet, playwright, wit, aesthete, and \\"posing sodomite\\"--is a masterpiece. It won two awards upon its original publication in 1988, the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics' Circle Award. At 589 pages of text in the paperback edition (not including notes, bibliography, two appendices, and the index), this will stand as perhaps the most definitive biography of a quite colorful man who had the unhappy talent of taking like a moth to the flames of his Victorian era. He could chat up a room, dress to the nines, act camp, and deal in rough-trade dalliances with homosexual prostitutes when \\"gross indecency,\\" homosexual acts not amounting to sodomy, were still considered a crime. Indeed, he was imprisoned for two years of hard labor (1895-97) when the father of his longtime but faithless lover decided to make a scapegoat of him. Today we might view him more as an Elton John or Brian Epstein, a successful man now able to enjoy society's gains in tolerance.Wilde's literary output was not vast, when compared to that of some others. As he himself boasted, \\"I put my genius into my life, and only my talent into my works.\\" Yet he is well remembered for his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, his play The Importance of Being Earnest, and his 50,000-word De Profundis (the last of these a long letter of recrimination to his fickle lover, Lord Alfred Douglas). Wilde married Constance Lloyd in 1881 and had two sons with her, but he could not fairly be described as a family man and he ended his life apart from them. After he was released from prison he quickly left England for the continent, never to return, wandering the streets of Paris alone and spending what little money he had on alcohol. He died in 1900 at the age of 46, from spinal meningitis of uncertain etiology. Ellmann claims it was syphilitic in nature, but it also might have stemmed from an injury in jail that burst his right ear drum. After a nine-year burial elsewhere, Wilde's remains were transferred to the P&egrave;re Lachaise Cemetery inside the Parisian city limits. This book contains many fine pictures of his life, including that of his tomb--adorned by a modernist angel whose male genitalia were vandalized, only to be replaced eventually by a silver prosthesis. Even more than a century after his death, Wilde still excites controversy."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"I am a biography buff and am really enjoying this book.

As such, I kind of felt a extra bit of attachment and responsibility to how the book reached and found others. Up front, the biographical parts of Oscar Wilde's life were very interesting and engaging. The parts were Ellmann delves into literary criticism, not so much.I've always found literary lives and artistic souls quite interesting and entertaining. What I had hoped to get out of Ellmann's \\"Oscar\\" was something akin to this deliciously entertaining book:John Steinbeck, Writer: A Biography, but alas, it read closer to this:Lives of the Poets. \\"Lives of the Poets,\\" is one that you don't want to tackle unless you really like poetry. It's not an easy read. Neither is \\"Oscar.\\" Ellmann keeps the readers attention rapt when he engages in the details of Wilde's life and the brilliant candle he was early on and the train wreck of a life he seemed to seek out. It was almost like watching a reality show on Anna Nicole Smith except Wilde was talented, smart, witty, had something to say. They both very much liked men though and had campy tastes so the similarities are there.Reading through \\"Oscar Wilde\\" will leave the most loquacious and eloquent speech-i-fiers reaching for a dictionary on most each and every page. There are some top dollar word choices in Ellmann's book which makes me think he developed a way to talk and communicate over the years that only reached a select set of University professorial readers. If you are an English PhD you will know doubt want to rank Ellman's \\"Wilde\\" with a Wildean excess of stars: five I'm thinking.So our book club read, \\"Oscar Wilde\\" to the bitter end and we held a trial replete with judge, juror, prosecution, and defense. We put on trial again our dear Oscar and held him up to modern societal standards and found on the whole...3 votes against liking Oscar, 0 on his behalf. As you will read, should you dare try to crack open this book, Oscar was not so much into the responsibilites of life or working for a living or taking an egalatarian view of others--Oscar lived for the aesthetic beauty and was into style and wit and causing a scene. In many ways he was a large part of killing off the Victorian era through his aesthetic movement and connection to the decadents. See now I've lost you when I start throwing out high falutin' literary terms. I should have stuck to Oscar's life as should have Ellman. It's far more intersting.Cut the book to half the size and focus on the drama and meaning behind Oscar's short time on this earth and to me Ellmann would have had one dandy of a book. As it is, you'll be able to tackle 10 pages at a time until Ellmann starts addressing Oscar's life. Not recommended as a book club read but do hold a mock trial for Oscar and dress up like dandies and bring flowers.

It liberated me from the philosophy of that era that viewed women as chattels and property. It was, for me, a companion to Simone de Beauvoir's &quot;The Second Sex&quot;. Thanks to your out-of-print service, I now have another copy. My original copy got away because I was so eager to share it with friends whom I knew would appreciate the wisdom of Ms. Coudert.

Coudert's is still one of the clearest, sanest and most easily digestible of the genre. She recounts her own painful struggle as the neglected child of a narcissistic, alcoholic mother, and the devastation it wrought in her later life. Her advice is eminently sensible, practical,--and most important, it works. If you can find it, grab it. It still ranks as one of the best. I'm willing to bet it started a lot of people on the road to healing."},{"Title":"Advice from a Failure","review":"This is the only self help book that I have ever read and actually kept - and reread.

In the past, I read Mollo, Kantar, Grant... always on a quest to find a great and complete bridge book and never entirely satisfied... too simplistic, too advanced, hard to read, poor teaching skills...I wanted to find a book that was covering both the dummy play and the defense. Also, I wanted to revisit the very basics, to have a solid start, and then to go gradually into more complex techniques, covering virtually all aspects of the play, including the more advanced techniques. I was looking for the ultimate book: the Bridge Bible written by a brilliant teacher!When I was not really looking for a book anymore, I finally tried Watson's book. I hesitated at first, because I was told his style is a bit dry and too detailed. EUREKA!!! I regret not having started with this book the very first day I played bridge. This is the ultimate BIBLE! Not only it fulfilled all my above expectations, but it goes one step beyond, he is a genius, each chapter is a revelation. I did not learn techniques; I learned the principles underlying the techniques. It is like being thought secret knowledge by a wise guru, realizing how simple everything was in the first place. His style is clear, concise, and straight to the point, but he covers a lot of material. His summaries are ideal for fast and easy review. I don't have to mention how drastically my level of play changed.My quest is now over, I found the Grail, I now understand why Watson's book is recommended by most schools around the world.

This is the oldest and most comprehensive guide to understanding the cards. There is a wealth of information on suit combinations, basic strategies, and other principles of declarer play. You won't be able to read it in a weekend, or even a month, so plan to take it slowly and study each chapter carefully. A bestseller for over 65 years. My mother gave me this book almost 40 years ago, and I still find valuable information in it."},{"Title":"Watson's Classic Book on the Play of the Hand at Bridge","review":"This is a good book overall, and is generally considered a classic. However, it takes the reader through each deal in excruciating detail. Having said that, I have heard it being said that if you have the patience to go through it a few times(!!), you learn by \\"osmosis\\", and your game does go up a level. Meanwhile, for us mere mortals, Victor Mollo's \\"Card Play Technique\\" (also a classic) is much, much better. I have read that book cover-to-cover many times, and still learn every time I read it.

Virtually anything you need to know about the play of the hand is basically covered in this book from the fundamentals to relatively advanced play.

I am returning to competitive bridge after a long hiatus and this is the first book off of the shelf of my bridge library where I have a choice of about 200 books and over forty years worth of Bridge World magazines. When I was playing regularly I reread parts of this book every year or so. The key to play of the hand is transitioning concepts from the play of card combinations to whole hand planning and principles of timing of the play and this book lays out everything you need to get started.If you are new to bridge (and even if your not) I recommend that you have a pack of cards handy as you read and layout the positions as described. This is a really good idea in some of the later the later sections, get used to seeing the physical cards and counting winners, losers, entries, etc. Counting cards and tracking spots is usually easier for most people when you see them on the table."},{"Title":"Watson's Classic Book on the Play of the Hand at Bridge","review":"Watson's book is totally serious. It makes no attempt to entertain; rather it maintains a steady focus on the subject: how to play your cards in bridge. Starting with fundamental concepts of card rank Watson leads you gradually and carefully through the details of trick taking and defense, illustrating each new concept with excellent examples of actual hands, perfectly constructed to illustrate the point and thoroughly explained in the accompanying text. It is a book to be studied slowly, moving forward to the next section only after understanding the current one. You cannot \\"skim\\" through this book.

The not inconsequential history of the Cistercian Order, the men and women that have peopled it like robins arriving and defining their eternal Spring, and at the same time, the sacred history of one man's soul are all found here in a text beautifully composed with order, entrancing prose, and the humility of true faith. This is my favorite Merton book, I think because it is so full of his new love! Written in 1949, &quot;The Waters of Siloe&quot; is rivaled only by &quot;The Sign of Jonas&quot; for its beauty and depth of meaning. Layers of beauty and solitude pervade every page, taking the reader into Merton's own heart, really, into the deep still water of his life as a priest and Trappist monk. Merton's astounding facility as a writer is always subordinate to the searching of his own heart, so that even while he writes like a prophet, he plays at no pretense of knowledge or superior understanding, keeping his formidable gifts focused on the object of his love and study, his Christ and the monastic vocation. Such a delicate balance only shows forth his literary genius all the more, yet leaves such a sweetness in the heart that one wants to give up all literature for the love of God, whatever one's natural inclincations, whatever one's tradition. Merton's is a rare and matchless talent, the gift of true understanding, really, and never used more wisely or more warmly than in &quot;The Waters of Siloe&quot;. If you are a seeker who desires to know what it is to enter upon the path, to suffer and be glad, read this book. There isn't another like it."},{"Title":"The waters of Siloe","review":"Originally published in 1949, this will probably be the most entertaining source the otherwise uninformed reader will initially have on the history of the Trappist monastic order. Written by the order's most famous champion, Merton's talents for story telling come through to make this a truly engrossing tale of heroics in the face of constant adversity by some very remarkable men over several centuries. There is a wonderful lack of religious pontificating on the part of the author, however that message is abundantly clear in the examples of the lives reported on. An especially engossing story is found in the tale of the monastery lost to the Communists during the early 1940's in China, and the death march of the captive monks. If there is any fault in the book, it is the lack of further detail expected when so much history is crowded into one volumne. An entertaining read and a worthwhile addition to any library."},{"Title":"The waters of Siloe","review":"kjhk kjh kjh k kjh kjh kjh kjh kjhkjh kjh kj kjh kj kjh kjh kjhkjh kjh kjh khjkhkjh kjh kjh kjhkjhjh k"},{"Title":"The waters of Siloe","review":"Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, as well as a best-selling writer, poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. Tragically, he was accidentally electrocuted while in Thailand at a conference of Christian and non-Christian monks. He wrote in the Prologue to this 1949 book, \\"If you want to understand why the monks lead the life they do, you will have to ask, first of all, What is their aim? One purpose of this book is to answer that question and tell who the Trappists are and where they came from and what they think they are doing.\\"He suggests, \\"That is what is called the contemplative life: a life that is devoted before all else to the knowledge and love of God and to the love of other men in Him and for His sake.\\" (Pg. 18) Later, he adds, \\"Contemplation and action necessarily have their part in every religious Rule. The two must always go together, because Christian perfection is nothing else but ... perfect love of God and of men.\\" (Pg. 31)He states, \\"The monk is a man who has given up everything in order to possess everything.\\" (Pg. 39) He clarifies, however, \\"Let us assume that you could fill a few monasteries with men quite capable of sleeping on bare boards for five hours a night, fasting until evening every day in Lent on top of a long workday... The question is, would this regime be the best means for forming CONTEMPLATIVES? The aim of the Cistercian life is something more than mere athletic endurance.\\" (Pg. 133)He concludes, \\"For the monk has only one thing... that he can depend on: and that is not a thing, it is God. That is the key to the Cistercian life, the secret of its austerity and its penances. The monk becomes poor... But the only reason why he makes himself poor ... is in order to be immensely rich.\\" (Pg. 351)Not a dry \\"history\\" book, Merton's historical meditations will be of great interest to students of Merton, or those interested in learning more about the Trappist order. (They are called \\"Trappists\\" after the \\"La Trappe\\" abbey in France, and the order \\"Cistercians\\" after the 'cistels' or reeds in the marshy woodland where the order was founded, by the way; pg. 45 and 72-73.)"},{"Title":"The waters of Siloe","review":"While agreeing with the previous reviews about the extraordinary amount of material here and Merton's ability to write narrative in a way that engages in an entertaining way, I have one problem with the book. He frames it around the premise that when Cistercians/Trappists are faithful to their carism as a contemplative order they flourish and when they are unfaithful, they decline. Simplistic enough to remind one of the similar premise of the Deuteronomic Historian, this pattern cannot truly cover all eventualities. Surely there are times when they failed though being faithful - especially the monks of Our Lady of Consolation in China. Also, his remarks about Communism here and in his lectures really reflect American thought in the late 40s and 50s to a surprising degree considering the later Merton.The photos and monastic glossary at the end are also useful. A good book but not as rigorous intellectually as one would expect from a man of Merton's background.Actually, the inspiring stories of the hardships faced by the new foundations in the US were enough to carry me through committing myself to solitary life in poverty in a very beat up house. When I made the comparison to a monk friend, he replied, &quot;But they were men.&quot; Please, Father, the were COMMUNITIES of men. The book shows what such groups with God's help can accomplish. And eventually I fixed the house enough."},{"Title":"The waters of Siloe","review":"H&aacute; uma quantidade estrondosa de informao, por&eacute;m &eacute; extremamente prolixo. A segunda parte no entanto &eacute; fant&aacute;stica, cheia de encanto e poesia. Foi o resgate de toda uma f&eacute; impressionante..."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This book is good for beginning runners...not a lot of new info for those of us running a long time (and who read a lot about it.) It does have a decent section about running during pregnancy, which is why I bought it. Overall, worth reading if you are a woman and love running."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This book was a birthday gift last year, and I loved every page (except for the few parts that don't quite pertain to me...running while pregnant, running during menopause). I have since recommended it to others and have given other copies as gifts. I even keep it handy as a reference material and resource.The book is written in such a tone that it's very easy and enjoyable to read, and the author gives a ton of practical information for runners of every level -- from nutrition information to training schedules to advice about running with your dog.The three areas I found most useful: 1) Nutrition information. I am 90% vegetarian, and I learned that my protein intake was far beneath what it needed to be in general, let alone for a runner. She provides recommendations/alternate food choices for vegetarians and just gives a lot of useful general nutrition info. (If you are a strict vegetarian and need a lot of diet information, you prob need another book. But if you want a good foundation, this will do it.) 2) Training schedules. She has everything from a 5k to a marathon, and she provides Gold, Silver and Bronze training schedules that allow you to choose the training program that fits your goals and time constraints. 3) History of women in running. I was fascinated (and horrified) to learn that women were not officially allowed to run marathons in the U.S. until the 70s, and the women's marathon didn't become an Olympic event until 1984.(It was considered bad for our reproductive organs. For the few women who did compete in marathons prior to the 70s, their times were not even recorded...not even for the woman who broke a world record in 1963.)Overall, the book is an inspiring read while providing a wealth of practical information in an easy-to-read package. And the history of women in running chapter is prob just one of many reasons I decided to sign up for my first marathon for this fall."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"In all respects, this book is a thoughtful and thorough reference piece for any new or experienced runner. After months of struggling with stomach pain after long runs, this book was the only one to offer me any sort of meaningful insights to the source and remedy for my stomach pain. I have shared this book with friends, who are new and old runners, and everyone that I have recommended this book to has appreciated the guidance and information detailed in the book."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I recently purchased this book for a friend and decided to get out my old copy to read again.I forgot what a wealth of information it has. Everything from stretching to gear to training plans plus wonderful short articles by actual runners. It also has information specific to women's health and pregnancy.If you are just starting out or don't consider yourself a runner, this book will inspire you. If you have been running for a while, this book can help you improve your PR or keep you motivated.It has inspired me to get serious about running again and am looking forward to my first half-marathon later this year."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I just started running and this book does a wonderful job of covering the very basics, from what kind of shoes and clothes to wear, to what to eat before a run. It also has little quotes and stories throughout that are inspiring for beginning runners. I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking about running."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I bought this book several years ago when I was thinking about starting a running program. At that time, I did not begin, but read the book, which gave many useful tips. Within the past 2 years, I have started running and I am currently training for a marathon. This book has proved to be a valuable tool to reference regarding many aspects of running, including footwear and clothing, nutrition, weather, health, nutrition, etc., etc."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"Great motivational stories and information for woman runners. Lots of very useful stuff, including two great chapters on stretching and strength training. Personally I don't find running on a vegetarian diet quite as &quot;challenging&quot; as she makes it out to be, but few authors can keep their personal biases from creeping into their writing. Overall a very helpful book to have."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. I can honestly say that it changed my life. It has everything a woman could need know about running. It got me from the point of not being able to run 5 minutes to running my first 1/2 marathon (and certainly could have gotten me to a marathon if I had any desire to run one). It has fantastic nutritional advice, great training plans, and advice for every situation a woman runner could find herself in.The book is easy to read - I read it in a couple sittings the first time through, as thought it were a novel. The essays and stories are powerful and helpful. It is well edited and organized.If you are a beginning runner, or if you have been running for year and you are looking for a new running guide, this book will be a great purchase. A number of friends have purchased it on my recommendation and they all say that it was a fantastic purchase."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This book is really great! It's written well with so much information that is broken down in easy-to-understand chapters. It's exactly what I was looking for! I was a beginner at running, but not at exercising. This book is so informative and so inspiring. Whenever I have a question or concern, I always turn to The Complete Book of Running for Women... for answers. After 8 months of running, I feel more than ready to try my first 5K. Claire's book has so much information about racing that I feel ready and raring to go!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I bought this, looked at it for a week and haven't gone back to it since. This book offers interesting information on training and taking care of your body, but I don't think I'll benefit from reading it again. I was looking for some inspiration for running, but didn't find it here. The book, however, does offer some good ideas to help you motivate yourself. Join or start a running group in your neighborhood. Connect with others who are interested in running. After all, do you want to run or do you want to read?"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This book is amazing! I am a beginning runner and read this book from cover to cover. It is EXTREMELY helpful! There are chapters that cover everything from selecting running shoes, evaluating running surfaces, running while pregnant, running during menopause, etc. My favorite item is a 10 week beginner's running schedule that lays out a very easy run/walk plan that culminates in the ability to run for 30 min (about a 5K). For you advanced runners, there are also schedules with much higher mileage, i.e. marathons or half-marathons.Kowalchik covers issues for all runners as well as issues specific to women. She also addresses topics such as nutrition, cross-training, and injury prevention.This book is ideal for the beginning to advanced runner. This book definitely helped and motivated me. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"After 2 kids and a &quot;not-so-active&quot; lifestyle, I was looking for information on starting a running and training program to run my first 5K. This was EXACTLY what I was hoping to find in a beginners guide! And when I'm feeling a little sluggish or lazy about my training- I just read a few pages and I'm ready to tie on my running shoes! This book even told me where to buy an excellent sports bra! I would recommend this book to anyone looking to begin an active lifestyle- no matter how active (or inactive) you may have been!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This is a great book for runners of every level! Not only does Claire take you through shopping for shoes, bras and treadmills, she explains how running is affected by menapause, pregnancy.. she talks about eating disorders and proper nutrition.. What i like the best is all the training information. How to do pace workouts, speed drills, strides, how to breathe and how do weighlift.. A great book overall!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I used this book to start running again after a fourteen year hiatus. The beginner's schedule for running/walking is what got me going (don't forget a sports watch)--the anecdotes and stories written by other women kept me inspired. I've long since lost this book because I've lent it out so many times, but I recommend it to every woman who tells me they'd like to start, in fact, I did just this morning which is why I looked it up on Amazon. It's been seven years since I hit the road, and now I run four miles every other day. It's changed and strengthened my body, increased my stamina, provided a clear space in my mind and allowed me to get to know myself better. Give it a try! You have nothing to lose and many things to gain."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I have never considered myself a runner, but this book gave me an easy to follow running plan and great exercises to go with it. I have been running for 3 months now - a record! Although the plan was a little too aggressive for me, it was easy to modify to fit my needs. My running times have been increasing and my walking times decreasing. It has been three months and I have never enjoyed running more! Great book!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I am so glad I bought this book! Claire's advice is comprehensive and she covers virtually every subject that is of interest to women runners. She talks about training for different races, nutrition, special concerns for women, running safely, stretching, weight training, and more. I recommend this training guide for any woman who is interested in beginning a running program or is looking to improve her running. This is a great buy!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I got this book 1 week ago. I love it. I read it in 2 days and devoured the information it contained.

I found the content easy to understand and extremely useful. Strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This book makes every woman feel as though they can achieve anything by giving the motivation to do everything. It not only gives the facts, but it gives reasons to run, how to run, where to run, everything you need to know about running, especially for a woman. It first gives you the health reasons to run and then gives you REAL reasons--to make yourself proud of your self. The book not only gives motivation, it gives you ways to keep up the motivation, and not get sick of the running, because we all know we can keep up with a schedule for a week and it is all over. But, this book makes it so its all over when YOU WANT it to be over--never! The book hits every point that a normal running book would, but it also hits every point a woman needs to hear. It is a great book. So, if you need motivation, reason, facts, and ways to achieve your goal, well, Get This Book."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It was marketed not only towards beginners but also seasoned runners. If you have been running for any amount of time, this book has very little to offer. If you are a beginner or just looking to start running, this book may be helpful. It seems to be written to help women feel motivated and empowered to run, but not as a training guide. This book does cover many topics, but does not go into any detail or provide supporting information. If you need help getting started, finding motivation, or just some general info then you may want to check this book out.Considering the author is a former editor for Runner's World, I was surprised that in several places in the book she demeans the stereotypical female-runner body type saying that it is unattractive and not what women should aspire to attain. I have been an avid runner for 8 years and was slightly offended that a book on running would speak so negatively about having a thin physique, especially since I know many high-mileage runners that would like to gain weight but can't. Basically, if you already are, or want to get more serious about running, this book is not the appropriate resource."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"Hi Guys! I am a perfect man with a perfect vision and all men and women should run. It does not matter who you are or in what profession you are in.

I first want to rave about the delivery. I ordered it on 9/20 and it was delivered on 9/21. It was estimated to arrive on the 24. It was arrived to my door by a carrier other than UPS or USPS.I am going to start reading the book tonight. I will update this review once I am finished."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I learned a lot after reading this book. For example, the book suggested the only place for headphones and a portable tape player was while running on a treadmill. Being 22 years old, I did not know what a portable table player was. I had to look it up, and that is what I learned today."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"Starts off with some good tips but nothing that you can't research and find on the internet."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"While this book overall provides a lot of useful RUNNING information, especially to the beginner, the nutrition section may offend vegetarians, and provides misguided &quot;information&quot; about the necessity of meat. In this section, Ms. Kowalchik sounds like she might have been paid by the dairy and meat industry to promote their products! She has a section devoted to promoting red meat for all its wonderful vitamin/mineral content (without mention of possible carcinogenic effects), insinuating that the reduction of meat in our diet is to blame for women falling short in their RDA of protein,which is flawed logic because we have generally increased our intake of protein from other sources to compensate. In a section on iron she points out that iron from vegetable products are best absorbed when served with meat, so &quot;add some meat to your bean chili.&quot; (p. 93) That's the kind of statement that makes a vegetarian (like me) fume!This is not to say she promotes a meat- or dairy- oriented diet (like Atkins)-- she basically promotes the food pyramid, but does not seem very open to or informed about the advantages of a more vegetable-soy oriented diet, which is widely touted by nutrition experts as quite healthy and safe. For those serious about nutrition, I would skip this chapter of the book."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"Never received email or any contact from seller.

And the book told me so.I was looking for something to maybe improve my form, maybe help me go a little faster. I am a runner, but starting later than some and run on my own. And while a 7 mile run may sound far for some, I have greater goals. No Marathons yet but soon. I thought it a good idea to buy a few books and see if I could learn anything. Out of 4 books I bought, this one I really enjoyed and even made me feel more like getting out to run more than ever. I usually would get up early, but then work got in the way. This book got me out to run after work, and I felt great for doing it. I think this book is a great addition to any runners library, beginner or a little more advanced.Great gift for a woman who likes the idea of running but is maybe unsure how to go about it."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"This is a good book for beginning women runners. It has quite a bit of information, but not too much. The book is friendly/chatty. She tries to make running approachable for anyone. I even read parts of this book outloud to my husband. Good useful information. For most women who just want to take up running for fun, fitness, recreation this book will be sufficient. It has training plans for training for races, if you should choose to try racing. Also information about stretching, weight training and so on. However, if you decided to get \\"serious\\" about running and want to become competitive, you will outgrow this book. That's fine. It's a good stepping stone until you figure out what level you want to train at."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I loved this book. I'm 17 years old, going on 18, and just took up running in early August 2001. I didn't really know much about things like warming up, stretching, and other ways to prevent injuries. And so, in 3 1/2 months or so, I've suffered 3 injuries. First, an injury to my lower left ankle, that took over 3 weeks to heal and then came back for about a week about a month later. Then I had an ITB problem (left leg) that only kept me from running for 3 days or so. Now I'm suffering from a pulled muscle in my upper right thigh that occured about 2 1/2 weeks ago. While I wait for it to heal, I'm reading everything I can about injury prevention, and this book seemed like it would be a good book for that, and also a good overall running book. This book is really amazing. There's tips on everything from nutrition, injury prevention, race training, cross training(for when you're injured or just need a rest), speedwork, motivation, what to wear, and anything else you could possibly need to know. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I love this book -- It has become my bible! I read the book in less than a week, I could hardly put it down. When I first got the book, I thought it might be over my head (even though I've been running for years!), but I found that everything was explained well and every option was laid out for me to see.

The book delivers some insight on how to begin a running regime, but nothing earthshattering. It tells you to start slow and condition, eat right and enjoy yourself. Good book if you need that little extra encouragement, but my advice: save the money for some good running shoes."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I am a new runner who quickly incurred an injury because I went from the couch to \\"too much too soon\\". I knew nothing about running except get a new pair of great shoes, and get out there and run!I WISH I wouldve had the foresight to research running before I started.

A marathon is on the horizon for this year. I've read several running books so far, and this is by far the most worthwhile, well-written, and helpful read of them all! Honestly, I think it would be just as valuable to a man as it is to a woman. My favorite highlight of the book is the succinct, understandable way that it clarifies what exactly running jargon means (fartleks, tempo runs, etc) for us newbies. That said, advanced runners would benefit from this book as well.

Take it a step at a time. And if you are on a treadmill doing these runs, please, please, please, please get yourself outside with these runs if you plan on doing a 5K or 10K once done...a treadmill does true running no justice whatsoever because no one is propelling you when you are outside nor are you on a softer surface.....My first run outside was during week one, day three: it felt daunting for about the first 20 minutes but then I was revved and ready to go...didn't want to stop but HAD TO.Good luck to anyone using this plan."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I needed to buy a replacement book for the library after my puppy crewed on a running book I had checkedout.

I picked it up from my library a few weeks ago and ended up buying it because I think it will be such a good reference book for me in the future.The number one thing that sets this book apart from the other running books I've seen out there is that it's written by a woman for women. Kowalchik knows what she's talking about, and she's been there. She includes chapters on safety, nutrition, running through pregnancy or menopause, and what to wear in any season. She also includes the training schedules she used to get ready for 5Ks, 10Ks, halfs and marathons.

I'm reminded of the reasons that I used to love training, exercising and running. Even better, I'm learning a few things I didn't know!

After a year of self-controled weight loss and fitness improving, and at the ripe old age of 47, I discovered running for the first time in my life. I decided to test my skill at a charity 5-K, and I bought this book in time to read it before the race. The only thing it didn't adequately prepare me for was the feeling I got as I turned that last curve and headed for the finish line! Talk about your runner's high! If you only buy one book about running for women(and indeed, after you read it you'll only need this one), get this one. I highly recommend it and would someday like to personally thank Claire for writing it! Thanks to her, I not only ran the entire 5-K, but I set a personal best! Get it, and good luck!"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I really enjoyed this book and found it very easy to read - especially for a reference book.I've got my first race coming up this weekend, and Claire's motivational and racing chapters have really helped me prepare.

The injury section was very cursory for instance. And the tone of some of the motivational stuff felt like it's target audience was more young girls than women.

You should either own, borrow, or give a copy of this book to someone."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I purchased this book here as a guide to hopefully 're-learn' how to run, the mental part of the sport as well as the physical. I used to run 5Ks 10 years ago, and decided to start again, and hoped the book would help the emotional part of getting back into shape, and this time without the shinsplints and wrong shoes and diet that plagued my first foray into running. As a book written by a woman for women, I hoped that it might contain specific information and advice geared for the female body, and to that end, it does succeed.While most of the writer's insights and advice are - yes - common sense, sometimes seeing it in writing makes it New again, so there I would give kudos to the writer. Her references to the many types of races, how to race with children, spouses, how to prepare for a race or how to train more efficiently are also helpful, as is the never-saw-it-like-THAT way that running can help the aging female body.However, there is definite distinction made in this book between a Runner and a Jogger, and if you are the latter (as me), or cannot immediately go out and do 'and easy 5 Mile run', then this book might not exactly help in the 'help me at least get out and MOVE' area. She pretty much alludes that this is a book for RUNNERS. I run because I enjoy it, it is good for me, and it's a great way to stay in shape. I have no need to have a 'best time' for a mile, ten miles, marathon, etc. I'm competitive, but not to the point that I will dedicate my entire life to the next schedules race. Maybe I have the wrong attitude about it all, but it still seems rather elitist at times, which is a shame since interdisposed with all the running mantras are alot of really good advice points.Even though this seems - to me, at least - to be a self-help book for women who want to run, really, unless you are either a former 10K+ runner or marathoner, or have the luxury of living in a safe area where you can run over hills and along stretches of roads (gee, kind of like the cover of the book), it reads as a 'welcome back' for the mid- and long-distance runner."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Running for Women","review":"I am a 30 year old mother of 3 and I wanted to start running again.

Then, I got married and had a baby. During the pregnancy, I gained well over 60 pounds. I started exercising again at the health club, taking classes, etc., but I was not losing the weight! It was very frustrating. Then I got a new job as a teacher and jr. high track coach! The idea of being a track coach who hadn't run since high school was frightening....so, I decided that I needed to get back in the swing of running. I figured that since I had tried to stay active, I could just go out and do it. I was wrong!! I got injured, and was frustrated. I decided to go on-line and see if I could find a book to give me the basics of how to get back into running after taking time off. I didn't want to run competitively, I simply wanted to be able to keep up with my track kids on an easy road run day for supervision purposes. :)This book was the answer!! It gave me the routine I needed to break back into running (no injuries from this routine!) It was also motivational!! I started waking up before my husband and daughter woke up and went for my run/walk work-out and then I would do the strength routine also provided by this book. I ended up losing all of my baby weight, and I was able to wear out my track kids. This year, I have started entering into races, and I have fallen in love with the sport of running all over again!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is new to running or returning to running. It is very imformative on how to do it safely, stay motivated, and the benefits of running for your health!"},{"Title":"James Connolly: A Political Biography","review":"A word. They tell a story about James Connolly that just before the start of action in Easter, 1916 he told the members of the Irish Citizen's Army (almost exclusively workers, by the way) that if the uprising was successful to keep their guns handy. More work with them might be necessary against the nationalist allies of the moment organized as the Irish Volunteers. The Volunteers was mainly a petty bourgeois formation and had no intention of fighting for a Socialist Republic. True story or not, I think that gives a pretty good example of the strategy and tactics to be used in colonial and third world struggles by the working class. Would that the Chinese Communists in the 1920's and other colonial and third world liberation fighters since then had paid heed to that strategic concept.James Connolly, June 5, 1868-May 12, 1916, was of Scottish Irish stock. He was born in Edinburgh of immigrant parents. The explicit English colonial policy which created the Irish diaspora produced many such immigrants from benighted Ireland to England, America, Australia and the far flung parts of the world. Many of these immigrants left Ireland under compulsion of banishment. Deportation was a standard English response in the history of the various \\"Troubles' from Cromwell's time on.Connolly, like many another Irish lad left school for a working life at age 11. The international working class has produced many such self-taught and motivated leaders. Despite the lack of formal education he became one of the preeminent left-wing theorists of his day in the pre- World War I international labor movement. In the class struggle we do not ask for diplomas, although they help, but commitment to the cause of the laboring masses. Again, like many an Irish lad Connolly joined the British Army, at the age of 14. In those days the British Army provided one of the few ways of advancement for an Irishman who had some abilities. As fate would have it he was stationed in Dublin. I believe the English must ruse the day they let Brother Connolly near weapons and near Dublin. As the old Irish song goes- \` Won't Old Mother England be Surprised'.By 1892 Connolly was an important figure in the Scottish Socialist Federation which, by the way, tended to be more militant and more Celtic and less enamored of parliamentarianism than its English counterpart. The failure to gather in the radical Celtic elements was a contributing factor to the early British Communist Party's sterility. Most of the great labor struggles of the period cam from the leadership in Scotland and Ireland. Connolly became the secretary of the Federation in 1895. In 1896 he left the army and established the Irish Socialist Republican Party. The name itself tells the program. Ireland at that time was essentially a classic English colony so to take the name Republican was to spit in the eye of the English. Even today the English have not been able to rise to the political level of a republic. Despite Cromwell's valiant attempt and no thanks to the British Labor Party's policies this is sadly the case today. All militants can and must support this call- Abolish the monarchy, House of Lords and the state Church of England.In England Connolly was active in the Socialist Labor Party that split from the moribund, above-mentioned Social Democratic Federation in 1903. During the period before the Easter uprising he was heavily involved in the Irish labor movement and acted as the right hand man to James Larkin in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. In 1913 when Larkin led a huge strike in Dublin but was forced to leave due to English reprisals Connolly took over. It was at that time that Connolly founded the Irish Citizens Army as a defense organization of armed and trained laboring men against the brutality of the dreaded Dublin Metropolitan Police. Although only numbering about 250 men at the time their political goal also became to establish an independent and socialist Ireland.Connolly stood aloof from the leadership of the Irish Volunteers, the nationalist formation based on the middle classes. He considered them too bourgeois and unconcerned with Ireland's economic independence. In 1916 thinking they 'were merely posturing', and unwilling to take decisive action against England, he attempted to goad them into action by threatening to send his Irish Citizens Army against the British Empire alone, if necessary. This alarmed the members of the more militant Irish Republican Brotherhood, who had already infiltrated the Volunteers and had plans for an insurrection as well. In order to talk Connolly out of any such action, the IRB leaders, including Tom Clarke and Patrick Pearse, met with Connolly to see if an agreement could be reached. During the meeting the IRB and the ICA agreed to act together at Easter of that year.When the Easter Rising occurred on April 24, 1916, Connolly was Commandant of the Dublin Brigade, and as the Dublin brigade had the most substantial role in the rising, he was de facto Commander in Chief. Following the surrender he was executed by the British for his role in the uprising. Although he was so badly injured in the fighting that he was unable to stand for his execution he was shot sitting in a chair. The Western labor movement, to its detriment, no longer produces enough such militants as Connolly (and Larkin, for that matter). Learn more about this important socialist thinker and fighter.

They note that the OECD says that for the industrialised economies, the natural rate of unemployment, below which inflation will accelerate, is 11%. So for the Bank, \\"the focus of monetary policy becomes to ensure, in practice, that unemployment is sufficiently high to reduce price and wage increases.\\" The present level of unemployment across euroland is 11%, so this must be an EU success story: why aren't we applauding?They show that Britain is not meeting the five tests. The EU's economies are diverging, as Wim Duisenberg has admitted. We have more economic flexibility than euroland does; investment into Britain is rising, the City of London is flourishing, and unemployment is lower than in euroland.On the political side, many of the essays prove that the EU wants the euro to lock members forever into the planned EU state. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said, \\"The introduction of the euro was not only the crowning-point of economic integration, it was also a profoundly political act, because a currency is not just another economic factor but also symbolises the power of the sovereign who guarantees it.\\"And it would be a most undemocratic state, as even the Euro-fanatic Michael Heseltine admits: \\"The ... notable characteristic of present political arrangements is that they are about as ineffective and unaccountable as they could be ... the institutions themselves are totally incapable of adjusting to that change. We have federalism by stealth ...\\" Unaccountable, incorrigible, deceitful - he could be describing himself! No wonder he loves the EU."},{"Title":"My Fellow Americans: The Most Important Speeches of America's Presidents, from George Washington to George W. Bush (Book & CD)","review":"The history of the United States comes alive in the words of its presidents.There comes a dramatic time in the life of a person, party, organization or nation that cries for the uplift and release of a speech. Someone is called upon to articulate the pride, hope or grief of it all. The speaker becomes the center of attention and the world stops to listen.That responsibility is often shouldered by our President. Great Presidents not only act as the country's head of state, but also the voice of its people. They help define who we are and what we experience. In my opinion, their speeches constitute one of the best expressions of the nation's mood.This book presents 40 of the nation's greatest Presidential speeches. Former Clinton Speechwriter Michael Waldman, introduces them, anchors them in history and explains their impact.Acknowledging that speeches are written for the ear, not the eye, this book contains two CD that allow you to hear many of these actual speeches. Some of the recordings are more than 100 years old. The voice of every President since Benjamin Harrison is included.This book takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the nation's history guided by the words of our Presidents."},{"Title":"My Fellow Americans: The Most Important Speeches of America's Presidents, from George Washington to George W.

These contain the actual voices of every president since Benjamin Harrison in 1889. It also includes comments by ex-presidents Ford, Carter and Clinton on the speeches that influenced them the most.This book is a capsule of American history done in a way that brings it home faster and easier than any standard history textbook. It's a large format book and at 480 pages it can contain a lot of material and it does. It is a splendid book."},{"Title":"My Fellow Americans: The Most Important Speeches of America's Presidents, from George Washington to George W. Bush (Book & CD)","review":"I actually heard Michael Waldman (the author) give a lecture regarding the genesis of this book. Mr. Waldman was President Clinton's chief speech writer for 5 years. When Mr. Waldman once asked an aide for a reference text on the most important presidential speeches in history, he was told that no such text exists. It is my understanding that this was the primary motivation for Mr. Waldman to write this book.I thoroughly delight in reading the speeches that Mr. Waldman has selected. In particular, I am in agreement with Mr. Waldman regarding the centrality of Abraham Lincoln's speeches in American History. I have come to agree that the Gettysburg Address is \\"the most important speech\\" ever given by a president.This is a book that I have read over and over again.

However, if you can make it through those gruesome scenes, \\"Death Trance\\" is far more tame on the \\"gross-out\\" factor than other Masterton books out there.For those of you who like crime novels and are looking for something a little different, you may wish to check this book out--it has a mystery, a very twisted criminal conspiracy, and more. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Death Trance","review":"Delving into Hindu mysticism, \\"Death Trance\\" tells a story of murder, revenge and greed. The main character - Randolph Clare - is the owner of a successful company in the cotton oil business. However, someone - it seems - is out to destroy him. First one of his factories is bombed, and then his wife and three children are horribly murdered. While in hospital recovering from the shock of hearing this, he meets Dr. Amara, a practicing Hindu, who tells Randolph about the Hindu belief in reincarnation, and mentions people who may be able to contact the dead. This becomes an obsession for Randolph, even as he begins to fear for his life. Dr. Amara warns that there is terrible danger in seeking the death trance, as leyaks - zombie-like creatures - inhabit the plane of reality one enters, waiting to grab souls for their goddess in hopes that she will grant them rest. The book takes us from the cotton fields of Tennessee to India and back.This book is NOT for the faint-hearted - the scenes where Randolph's wife and children are killed is difficult to handle and that is only the first of many very graphic scenes. However, it is very well written and a satisfying horror read.

While I was looking for something new to read before I finished the last few chapters in another book I read, I found this one on the floor. Out of a whim I started to read it and two days later I was done!!The story sucks you in and doesn't let go of your imagination, one thing many people don't realize is that the more you read the most surreal your dreams become. This book was very surreal and detailed, I really really enjoyed it and recommend it to horror fans, spiritual fans and thriller fans. Also those of you into the dynamics of how a business works this is a good little book to check out. My only grip was the ending of the book, I felt the author ran out of steam right toward the end, and it also left the love-interest theme hanging. If a sequel had been made to explain the end I would have really loved to have purchased it. Having said that I am still buzzing from such a good read!!"},{"Title":"Death Trance","review":"Imagine not saying goodbye to your loved ones before somthing bad happens to them and then you get the chance to say bye....sort of.This book is scary, gory, and downright disturbing...which is Great! The horror of realizing what has happened and what one will do to get back at a hated person is amazing. IF you want to be scared bad, and do not mind reading up on gory stuff, this book is for you. Just make sure you have a light on, the windows are closed a machette under your chair!Graham Masterton, once again, has proven himself in this book to be above and beyond all mortal horror writers!

Coast defence batteries, infantry pillboxes, air raid shelters, even the culverts used by Japanese when invading the island, are well documented. The maps are adequate but my criticism is that the authors dont cover works that dont exist any longer. A number of batteries are in that category, and we find nothing here about them. Recommended if you're interested in the fall of Hong Kong."},{"Title":"Fians, fairies, and Picts,","review":"This was a curious book containing a discussion of the historical and folkloric evidence which forms the basis of the theory that two cultural groups (the Fians and the Picts) not only existed, but turned into the fairies of contemporary stories through the slow altering of tales, language, and perceptions. It was presented to the Folk-Lore Society in 1892, but after further discussion they decided not to publish it as a paper, and instead it was released as this book you are even now considering (except more on paper and less electronically).I'm not sure how well the discussions would hold up against current cultural, historical and archaeological evidence, but it was a really interesting read, and clearly exhibits some of the best reasoning of that time. There is a light underlying tone of ethnocentrism towards the 'civilized' people of Great Britain, but nothing inexcusable for the time in which this was first written.My only complaints are:A) The foot notes are not linkedB) There are no illustrationsA is a mild irritation (though linking would have improved the experience), but B is really quite frustrating because almost half the book deals with discussing the plates in great detail--only there are no plates for the kindle reader to refer back to. If the pictures had been there I'd have given it the full five stars."},{"Title":"Fians, fairies, and Picts,","review":"Fians, Fairies and Picts by David MacRitchie was one of the first of the free Kindle books I grabbed, and THE first I read beginning to end. It is a scholarly treatise, written in 1892 to be presented to the Folklore Society. The writer postulates that the people referred to old stories, and histories, as Fians or Picts are the same people - or closely related to - fairies. His argument, based on even older written and oral folklore, is very persuasive. He also offers as evidence the mound dwellings found in many places in Europe. These dwellings, which even now are often referred to as fairy mounds, were apparently underground, or barely above ground houses of primitive people who must have been quite small in stature judging by the size of the doors, archways and tunnels leading into and throughout the mounds. Thus he believes fairies were certainly a race of humans, related to or actually the Picts or Fians, and most likely \\"dwarfs\\" or people of small stature.I found it interesting that someone so learned a few hundred years ago has reached the same tentative conclusions as I have concerning the fairy race. I, too, believe they are based on an actual race of people (or several races in different places) who did exist. I believe (and this writer does, also) that what likely happened is that over time the race was absorbed into other groups of people as the lands they lived on were invaded and conquered.The references and footnotes have given me a lot to seek out and see what I can find! Especially the extensive descriptions of the mound dwellings. I wish the drawings and diagrams were with the Kindle edition of the book, but they were not reproduced.Oh well, it gives me something to research. And I love research. Overall, I found it very interesting and thought provoking. It would be interesting to do some research and find out how these facts and conclusions presented in 1892 have withstood the test of time, and what facts may have been added or rejected as we have more evidence and scientific methods of investigation."},{"Title":"Fians, fairies, and Picts,","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. interesting book but the author's thesis is layed out, in great detail, in the long inroduction. Would have been more generous with the stars if it had illustations. I was greatly dissapointed with this because they are a necessary element in the analysis of the subject."},{"Title":"Internet Society: The Internet in Everyday Life","review":"This is not a book about technology, per se, but about how a mass audience of users can assimilate it into their lives. In a sense, the book describes a cusp. Ten years ago, when the Web was still young, it was mainly the technologically adept who used it. But now, in the developed countries, and increasingly in many developing countries, it is a mass medium. It has gotten this way partly by being easy to use. But also because powerful usages have emerged, that are attractive to many. Like searching for information, or auctions.The book offers insight into how this incorporation is proceeding. With suggestions as to future directions. Possibly driven by more [unexpected?] usages that have yet to be developed."},{"Title":"Walkabout Year: Twelve Months in Australia","review":"As an autobiography &quot;Walkabout Yours&quot; is a very good book, giving a slice of the life of Pickering family. As a travel book, it is very disappointing since Pickering is too involved in himself to describe parts of Australia. One can only find glimpses of information about Australia scattered among the daily concerns of Pickering family. Where you expect to find descriptions of Australian people, you find how much Samuel Pickering paid for his breakfast ($13.50), how much gas costs (76.5 cents) and other trivialities of daily life. Samuel Pickering is too absorbed with himself to describe Australia. Although Pickering's writing style is fluid and witty, the lack of observation of his surroundings makes this book a boring travel book"},{"Title":"The way of the storyteller","review":"The handful of other reviews here are not very substantial. I'm not an oral storyteller; I'm a writer looking for help with pitching stories. So my perspective on this book differs from other reviewers.First, the positives. Ms. Sawyer is a passionate and eloquent advocate of oral storytelling as an art form unto itself. She draws on a lifetime of experience and travel to argue that the art is worthy of an approach by practitioners that is reverent, rigorous, and passionate. She advocates that storytellers study subjects like music, voice, folklore and culture to deepen their art. There is also a fine selection of folk-tales that comprises the entire second half of the book.All of this is very good--but in my opinion amounts to little more than a pep-talk for librarians who want to tell stories to children. As proof of this I would cite that when Ms. Saywer revised the book in the Sixties she only added two chapters, one on children's literature and another on adding poetry (for children) to the story hour. Telling stories to children is a fine ambition--it's just not one this reader shares.However, there is plenty in the book that can be applied to other storytelling venues. But, as the author herself admits in the introduction, she has not written a practical manual on storytelling.So if, like me, you are looking for practical tips on ways to improve your storytelling (and not just deepen your appreciation for what storytelling can be) then you can safely skip this book."},{"Title":"The way of the storyteller","review":"Although Ruth Sawyer's quaint \\"The Way of the Storyteller\\" is more a book about verbal storytelling than it is about written storytelling, there is still much wisdom to be found in its pages.Sawyer's passion for stories shines through the pages and her rich experiences in interpreting the written word provide some useful guidance for authors. She explores the ancient roots of storytelling and shows how today's stories are inseparable from the patterns of the past.Sawyer talks of four invariables in story telling:ExperienceThe Building of BackgroundThe Power of the Creative ImaginationA Gift for SelectionExperience is what gives a story teller the ability to make the difficulties of her art seem simple; experience comes with writing and writing and writing until the techniques of the art are so ingrained they become invisible.The building of background is what enriches a story; the opportunity to gather a wide and varied background lies anywhere one looks.When an artist brings his creative imagination to bear on his material and - from something abstract, from something without form or meaning - transforms it into a real work of inspiration for others to enjoy, this then is the power of the creative imagination.Sawyer talks of a storyteller knowing which stories to select before entertaining her listeners. There must be an acceptance that some stories are not yours to tell, but belong to another who can tell them better. This gift of selection, too, can apply to writers: what suits one writer's voice may not suit another. And the gift lies in knowing which story suits your own writer's voice.Written in 1942, revised in 1962, what I found most poignant about Sawyer's recounting of the art of storytelling was her concern that novels - stories told in written form - have become marketable commodities and, as such, have become commonplace. On completing this book one cannot help but wonder if the current woes besetting the publishing industry have their roots in the fact that, for both author and publisher, profit is now placed above the ancient art of storytelling. If the novel is good enough, it will naturally sell as many copies as any author or publisher could ever want.The one thing I've taken away from this book is that - to be a true teller of stories worthy of all the story tellers who have come before us, from Homer to JK Rowling - the story itself is what matters most. What happens within its boundaries must be inevitable: every story must have an inner integrity and, to have a chance of being read and enjoyed many times over, it must leave the reader completely satisfied by a tale well-written.\\"Books are man's rational protest against the irrational, man's pitiful protest against the implacable, man's ideal against the word's real,... man's revelation of the God within him...if the first Prometheus brought fire from heaven in a fennel-stalk, the last will take it back - in a book.\\" (John Cowper Powys \\"The Enjoyment of Literature\\" as quoted by Ruth Sawyer in \\"The Way of The Storyteller\\")(Read September 2009; review posted here from my blog)\\""},{"Title":"The way of the storyteller","review":"The literature will help you see the big picture.

He begins his book by addressing the famous misinterpretations of his prophecies as well as those about world events that already happened. The book then focuses on World War III starting in 2002. He highlights areas of the world he believes will be most significantly changed by the war and names political figures he believes will be at the forefront of the war. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the prophecies of Nostradamus and current events. Montaigne leads the reader through a logical sequences of events from about the 1990s to about 2007, interpreting the quatrains to allow the reader to understand the evolution of World War III in 2002."},{"Title":"Nostradamus World War III 2002","review":"I strongly recommend this book. I like it for two reasons. First, it is very easy to read and follow, the author has a solid argument and some novel theories on the way people interpret Nostradamus. The author is an historian and he has his feet on solid ground. Unlike other books, like \\"Nostradamus prophecies for America\\" by David Ovason, Montaigne's book is not limited to reinterpret old quatrains related to events that happened a long time ago. In fact, he is trying to interpret the quatrains before the events described happen. This is very difficult to accomplish and he deserves some credit for trying very hard to get it right. Second, Montaigne describes a sequence of events almost identical to that described by the prophecies treasured by the Holy Catholic Church for hundreds of years, and the few points that he is not very certain about are those very nicely explained in the catholic prophecies (specially those related to the identity and roll of the Great Monarch or Great King and the change in location of the residence of the Pope). I would recommend people to read Catholic Prophecy by Yves Dupont, after reading this book. They both seem to complement each other. It all seems to make sense. Finally, the prophecies do not say that all of the events will happen in the year 2002. They say that the pieces of the puzzle will begin to align themselves in the direction place at that time. If you watch the news today, they all talk about Bush sending troops to the Middle East and Muslim people protesting against the USA. We are getting close to the point when all the things described in the book could happen. Therefore, I would recommend everybody to read the book, pray and prepare yourselves, regardless of your faith. May God bless you all."},{"Title":"Nostradamus World War III 2002","review":"I've read many previous Nostradamous books and found them large and unfocused. This book is great for two reasons - it provides a solid, focused overview of the important predictions of Nostradamous. But unlike similar books I've read, it presents compelling evidence and background research so clear that you can see for yourself the validity of the claims as well as learn what other claims out there are &quot;genuine&quot; and what are obvious romanticizing. (I echo a previous reader's comments of how much &quot;scarier&quot; this book's prophecies feel - it's &quot;scary&quot; because when you read it you are actually CONVINCED by his evidence of what may happen - not the case with books that simply &quot;state&quot; interpretations.)Before you go out and buy a bunch of huge Nostradamous books, I highly recommend this book to learn what's real and what's really important."},{"Title":"Nostradamus World War III 2002","review":"This book is scarier than other Nostradamus books I've read because the author clearly and persuasively explains the meaning of prophecies about the world war that will start this year. He begins by addressing famous hoaxes and misinterpretations of Nostradamus' prophecies as well as amazing predictions of events that have accurately come to pass. The book then focuses on World War III starting in 2002. Montaigne leads the reader through a logical sequence of events from the 1990s to about 2007, interpreting the prophecies to allow the reader to understand the evolution of World War III. Montaigne describes Nostradamus' predictions of events in the 1990s, in 2000, and in 2001. It looks like America will soon attack Iraq as he expects in early 2002, and then if he continues to remain on target, WWIII will soon be fully under way.

The famous quadrant about the &quot;year 1999 and seven months&quot; is also misinterpreted according to my opinion. Nostradamus wrote in a carefuly misleading way and I think that this particular quadrant is refering to the 1999 war in Yugoslavia and the NATO bombing campaign. As we know Operation Allied Force lasted for 72 days. If someone divides this period in 12 &quot;months&quot; and then take the 7/12 of these (&quot;seven month&quot;) then he has the exact date of the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade (&quot;he will bring back the King of the Mongols&quot;) from a B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber (&quot;will come from the sky the Great King of Terror&quot;). Before and after this unlucky hit the war was going perfectly for the NATO forces which didn't suffer a single casualty in combat (&quot;Before and after Mars rules happily&quot;).

There is nothing Godly or Christian about our degenerate Western societies. It is far more likely the 'beast' will be America.

Scully, the protagonist of this grim novel, drags his daughter Billie through Europe in search of his vanished wife, a black haired beauty with a similarly shaded heart. Scully is an utter moron, a naive everyman. His endearing unpretentiousness is negated by a tendency to make whopping errors of judgment. Winton writes dreamy sentences that evoke place and pain, but his plot stretches plausibility. We're required to believe that a good-natured bloke like Scully could actually subject his child to such tortures. His neglect is stupefying.Gypsy girl Billie, in one of the novel's many role reversals, eventually shepherds her doofus father, her comic book Quasimodo come to life, as they chase down shadows in unfamiliar Amsterdam. This reader simply wanted the search to end, for the hapless wanderers to return to their refurbished tumble-down in County Offaly. When they finally do, the house still feels vacant, the rooms draughty and cheerless. What Scully learns from the whole ordeal, other than his own ineffectuality, is not entirely clear."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"This is a book that deserves two readings to fully appreciate it's worth. Winton presents us with the classic scenario of the unexpected dissolution of a relationship. This time, it is the man and not the woman abandoned, the man and not the woman who follows their heart rather than their head. Scully is a man we can't help but like when we first meet him. He is content with what he has, and gains enormous pleasure from love and comforting surroundings. He is in every sense the new age guy, waiting for his family to join him for their new life in Ireland. The romance of their nomadic lifestyle and the resurrection of the old cottage in Ireland lure us in, so that Jennifer's disappearance is a profound shock. The novel descends with the disconcerting plummet of an elevator, as everything Scully believes to be true unravels. In the process, Scully unravels before our eyes, and we question whether we really like this man at all. A warning though. If you don't like endings that provoke more mystery than they solve, this book will leave you frustrated. This is where the second reading comes in. When you read it the second time you appreciate that this is one man's journey towards acceptance that sometimes life doesn't provide solutions or endings. If we are to move forward, we have to accept that life and people will not always give us what we think we need, to make sense of ourselves and others. On the second reading you see that for Winton to have given the reader answers that life will not give Scully, would be to defeat the purpose of the entire novel. Like Scully, we are left to wonder why. And that, is as it should be."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Role switching in book in which the male lea finds himself in traditionally woman's role: abandoned, uncertain, insecure."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"This book made me understand the concept about the journey being the important thing, not the destination.

Where is his wife? What has happened to her? We don't know, he doesn't know, and for reasons not ever explained, the daughter won't tell.The balance of the book drones on as he tries to figure out where his wife is. He never bothers to insist that his daughter tell him, rather traipses around Europe looking for her. His daughter is cold, dirty, gets attacked by a dog and still he never asks her where her mother is?By the end of the book, I was tired of reading his overly wordy descriptions and began skimming.The book ends without answering the question of where the mother is, or making any apologies to his daughter.

Just finished this \\"novel\\" and after 375 pages of setting the scene, I almost threw the book across the room. Yes, it is beautifully, achingly rendered. Every aspect is richly detailed and serves to draw you in and keep the pages turning. However, it feels like only half a story; like the author couldn't imagine a resolution that would satisfy, so he just gave up. The reader gets nothing. I understand that in real life people go missing and aren't ever found, but this was clearly a staged disappearance on Jennifer's part, and we never have an inkling of how or why. I know this is meant to be an examination of a downward spiralling psyche, and so it is. But without the rest of the story, it's just a lot of pretty phrases. Extremely disappointing."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"I read this book for a book club and couldn't discern what made someone recommend that we read it. We have an unattractive man married to a beautiful woman (actually all that was ever made clear was that she was breath-taking because of her black hair. This self styled \\"ugly\\" man labors for months under the most horrible conditions to render an unlivable shack barely habitable. This awful house was deemed a dream house by his \\"beautiful\\" wife who then went home to sell their old house and join him in living in their glorified shack, in a really miserable climate among the \\"simple folk\\". Did I mention that the wife fancied herself an artist of sorts with friends all over Europe? She sold the old house and was supposed to join him, bring with her the money from the sale, her unborn child and their daughter, who unfortunately, looks exactly like the husband. Guess what? The pregnant (?)wife and the money never show up in the new town. In fact the wife never shows up in the book! Only the silent, eight year old daughter arrives at the airport. I say silent because the shock of being dumped on a plane alone by her dear beautiful mom took away her power of speech. Eventually the daughter does speak, but never explains anything about the mom. The rest of the book is devoted to the father and daughter's unrewarded search, going from one country to another, looking for Mom. At one point the daughter's face is mauled by a dog. She won't allow anyone at the hospital to touch her, so the dad sews her up with a needle and thread. This puts the final touch to her charming ugliness, but nobody cares. The mom is never found and the book ends.SO WHAT?You may think that I'm just too stupid to understand the meaning of the book. Maybe you're right.

I was worried for his health, having been told as a child never to awllow chewing gum as it would stay in my stomach for 7 years and wrap around my intestines. Winton was wearing jeans, and maroon suit jacket and cowboy boots. His here extended to his waist. He was not what I had expected, but then I wasn't sure what I had expected: I knew he was a house-husband, surfer, born again Xtian, surfer, and award winning author. I also knew Cloudstreet was the best book I had read in '95.Winton was on a promotional tour of New Zealand for The Riders and he visited the University I was studying at. I guess I'm digressing big time here, so I'd better get to the point. Sure enough, in the course of his visit, someone asked what happened to Fred Scully's wife (as I noticed a few people have done here).To me this really is missing the point of the story. The story isn't about what happened to the wife, or about the wife at all, its about Scully. Winton depicts characters (and his really are &quot;characters' - good Ozzie blokes) in a way that resounds with truth and sincerity. He pulls no punches and shoots form the heart. Riders is a beautiful story in terms of description, yet stormy (without wanting to be too obvious metaphorically obvious) in terms of plot. Support Australasian authors, read it.PS: Winton's reply to the question re: Sully's wife, a perfect &quot;I don't know&quot;"},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"The first time I read this I was angry with Winton for leaving us up in the air: the book was un-put-downable but too much is left unexplained and unresolved. The second time round I was angry with Scully for his dogged stupidity in failing to accept that his wife has left him and their daughter. Thirdly, who on earth are the riders and what on earth do they signify? I usually enjoy Winton but this really is too much. I would like him to stand up and explain himself."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"How can the desparate search for a lost wife not be compelling?Meanwhile his prose has those tiny brushstrokes that snap your head back.Fine .. but does it 'say' anything?I really think it does...and other reviewers have opened my eyes to that. Think 'one's perspective of what is, may not be'.Might be obvious but Winton has you thinking about this at a level or two beyond the fact.Dont miss this book if you like poetry that is spare in a way Updike's is not."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"For the first 50 pages I was sure this would become one of my favorite books of the year. I was captivated by Winton's brilliant prose and his intriguing premise: Scully's wife Jennifer flies from Australia to join him in Ireland but doesn't get off the plane. Their daughter Billie does, but won't tell what happened to her mother. I felt nicely set up for a fine tale of suspense, as Scully sets off to find Jennifer. There was indeed plenty of suspense, as well as marvelously vivid descriptions of places and people. But when I finished the book I was frustrated and enraged. Read Michael Leone's review--he expresses my feelings eloquently. Furthermore, why couldn't we learn what happened to Jennifer? The only clue is Billie's impression on the plane that her mother's face was turning to marble. Not very helpful. One must conclude that Winton doesn't want us to understand, he wants us to accept the mystery without the resolution. That seems to be the message of the horsemen who gathered near the ruined Irish castle, twice: they symbolize Scully's desperate search, his failure, and his wounded psyche. Well, my psyche wasn't wounded by this book but it was definitely let down."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"I really enjoyed this book for several different reasons. First, I found Scully to be a likable character, though some of his choices were rather unlikable. He seems to genuinely love his wife and daughter and his devotion to them is endearing. His daughter, Billie, is one of the more interesting seven-year-old characters I've encountered and I did struggle a bit with the fact that she was only seven. So mature for her age! Pete-the-Post is another endearing character that, had the book taken a different turn, I would have loved to know more about. But this book isn't about Pete or his brother or any of the other secondary characters. This book isn't even about the missing wife. I found this book to be about anticipation, about waiting for something that may never appear, whatever that is."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Tim Winton's novel &quot;The Riders&quot;, a Booker Prize nominee, is a story about love. About different kinds of love, to be precise.Jennifer, a shadow figure, a mysterious woman with excellent legs and distorted self-esteem, abandons her unhomely but affectionate husband Scully and seven-year old daughter Billie. The novel is a story of father-and-daughter travel across Europe in search of their lost wife and mother.Scully's love to his runaway wife becomes an obsession, a kind of madness that is ready to crash and mutilate everything and everyone, including himself and his dear daughter. It increases with his inquiries at the places which he thought to be niches of mutual love and tenderness but turned out to be hideouts of disenchantment and infidelity.Scully couldn't overtake the eluding apparition of former passion but he could be rescued by other love that was always near, love of his daughter. 'Love was all you had in the end. It was like sleep, like clear water. When you fell off the world there was still love because love made the world. That's what she (i.e., Billie) believed. That's how it was.' This is not the difference between sexual and asexual love that makes sense but the difference between love as obsession and love as salvation. And it was necessary for Scully to walk a long and winding road of personal painful experience to reach the simple truth."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"So what am I missing? This book gets good reviews from doughty literary critics, and was even short-listed for the Booker. Yet I found the book deeply frustrating. The English is stylised &quot;simple&quot; prose - for which read simplistic, with the author seemingly having to drop in a couple of chapters of otherwise out-of context clever descriptive prose to remind readers that he can write prettily after all. The writing treats the reader like a dolt - if I see the phrase &quot;Scully had a big heart&quot; once more I will scream - thanks Tim, we got the point after only the fifth repetitiom.We are treated to a mystery of a man and his implausibly stoic and resourceful daughter in pursuit of his mising wife. Yet the plot artifces to keep this tale going would shame a soap opera - a woman meets the main character and remembers bumping into his wife from a photo of her, even though they had never met each other. The Greek police never bother to pursue a murder suspect, and he happens to go to an American Express office just in time to pick up a telegram to make a mysterious meeting. Scully of course has an encounter with some Irish ghosts, which his daughter naturally sees, and this &quot;waiting for destiny&quot; scene is supposed to have such symbolism that it recurs at the end and stands for the main character's search for happiness. Please. The characters are fairly well-drawn, and the story moves along at a reasonable pace, but for me the problems greatly outweigh the virtues.Sorry, but I have a degree, I am not unduly dense, and to me this book is not a modern masterpiece but just over-rated hokum. Avoid."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Reading &quot;the Riders&quot; is a balance between wanting to get through it as fast as possible to unlock the mystery of Jennifer's disappearance and trying to read what Winton does give to you. He is not Dickens; the detail is carefully chosen, just enough to set each scene and help the reader imagine Sculley with his battered and &quot;severely used face&quot; (p.9) I read this novel quickly, sorry to have to finish it, but glad that I read the novel. It is uncoventional from the average novel, but don't let that keep you from reading it."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Cracklin' prose that hauls you down into the page, two likeable vital characters at the center, and a fascinating whirlwind search for Mother Lover Lost. Somewhere past the two thirds point, when it was obvious to everyone in Creation but our hero that his wife was not worth finding, the guided world tour Winton felt obliged to take us on became a bit dragged out. Paris was extraneous, and goddamn Amsterdam. There were also many suspended elements, such as the old painter who jumped from his Grecian island cliff, which might've been developed or closed. And I never understood the function or symbolism of the Riders. Nevertheless, finely written, a worthy effort. I recommend."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"I listened to the audio book of this particular story, and I found it to be entertaining, descriptive and extremely well read.I'll be reading Tim Winton's other books, purely because of the way the man writes. He is so articulate and smooth in his delivery of this tale, that I became just as interested in his words, as what I was in the story itself.Yes, Winton throws you a few melons to tries and distract you. But on the whole, it's a goldmine of conflict and action - something is always happening, there's always a trail to follow."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"This is the story of a good but simple man whose wife is supposed to join him with their 7 year old daughter in the new home which he has rebuilt in Ireland. When the dazed daughter shows up without his wife, he starts a frantic, disorganized and eventually drunken search for her all over Europe. We watch the rapid descent of the hero into a state in which his 7 year old provides the only direction and stability of his life. He is only barely believable as a character and his daughter is even less credible. The writing is rich and often elegant but contains too much material that I would have considered daring as a teenage in the 60's but now seems trite. The story does not really develop, it just ends.

Suffice it to say that it wasn't intentional but when Scully's daughter shows up alone at Shannon airport traumatized and speechless, unable to explain the whereabouts of her mother, he begins the trek of a lifetime to find her. The book goes on and on as he drags Billie from country to country and bar to bar unable to face the truth, that his wife has left him.Seven-year-old Billie, is mauled by a dog, her face becomes infected and scared due to improper care. Scully brings her to squalid bars while he gets drunk day after day where she listens to disgusting language. In Amsterdam she is left to her own demise, as her father gets drunk to drown his sorrow. Somewhere around this point Scully is hit over the head and carted off to jail on Christmas Day.I stuck with this book because the author actually made Scully out to be a devoted dad and a likable character, the beginning of the book was exceptional and I was curious about the ending. It's just too bad he didn't follow through. I do wish there was more tie in to \\"The Riders\\", a ghostly group, mysteriously introduced in the beginning but that was also anticlimactic, and given no more than a few pages.The time came when I felt like enough is enough it's time to take it like a man Scully, and take care of your child. I got to the point where I didn't even care what happened to his wife Jennifer. I find it hard to believe this book was up for the Booker prize. I found it easy to skip whole paragraphs in the middle as Scully's paranoia ran rampart and repetitive. I kept thinking am I missing the point here but every time I doubted my reading savvy I was put off by the underlying child abuse.

Tim Winton has done all of us a great favour by remembering how to swear and when to do it, .. the dialogue is dead accurate.

The early scenes about Ireland really worked for me but the problem is Winton could have done more to weave them in to make it a story with more depth to it. The author creates these great pictures in your mind like of an old abandoned castle in the distant fields from Scully's new cottage. Or ghost riders on horseback during the late hours outside the castle. Intriguing stuff. But he just leaves it at that. Scully's wife leaves him, so he sets off on an impulsive trek to find her (or himself) as he tries to piece together why she left. Scully goes to Greece, Amsterdam and back to Ireland never really finding out anything. I feel his Scully character really makes no real shift in himself except getting drunk and feeling sorry for himself. It is, as if, the initial shock of her leaving just stays there to the end. The story would have had more completion for me if Winton showed Scully to have either the resolve to carry on as his own man with optimism or as a pessimistic defeated man. I was left with an empty void. I didn't have any real indication what was on Scully's mind. That was my biggest frustration. We never find out his internal thoughts in any real way. While the action does keep you interested to keep reading toward the end, I feel like I was just standing around as I read, waiting for something big to happen in Scully. In the end, it never came.

Impossible coincidences .. just like Seven Pounds .... how could he not extract any information from Billie about the separation ... finding it easier to trek across Europe for fear of disturbing her in some way.

It felt often like one of those movies where the hero does silly things and the whole time you think-don't do it!. Except here I was thinking-I understand him and I would probably have done the same stupid thing. The reason is of course that Tim Winton really gets you to believe in the story. He is a very good storyteller.It is not like you feel you have all the information, it is not as if you really understand Scully, but it is as if you understand as much of Scully as he understands of his wife. As much as we maybe can understand a complicated human being, even after sharing a life for many years.This book has some of the same intensity as John Fowles: The Magus, another very good book for those who like this one. They are both good at explaining parts of how it is to be a man. Though maybe only some important parts of it. (I hope there is more to us). Another good one is a book by a dutch writer (Harry Mulisch?): Turkish delight, which is also strong in describing this part of being men. Good advice for women who wants to undertand men better, test out these books, and you might understand a bit more about (at least) some sides of us. This is a good description of a maybe darker and mystical side of men, but it is still a part of who we are-for some maybe this side is not even visible.A friend of mine got so confused after reading this book that she just started reading it at once. If you like books to be clearcut and everything to be explained, avoid this book.I could not put this book out of my head and it is still riding around there and I have to read it as least one more time to see if I understand a bit more.

As evidenced in the brilliantly evocative Cloudstreet, Winton has the emotions of the reader on a string. Surely the mark of a successful writer is achieving what he sets out to achieve. In the case of The Riders, he explores the harrowing downward spiral, both emotionally and physically, of a simple and honest man and his daughter obsessed more with the idea of the perfect family and the perfect love, than recognising his marriage for what it is. Also at work in the novel is the frantic chase through Scully's inner-self and across Europe which shares its obsession generously with the reader. The sense of utter despair coupled with the faint glimmer of hope we feel for him by the time he encounters the ghostly riders for the final time are Winton trademarks. Of course there is no sense of closure; these are real emotions, realistic characters, real uncertainties of life. It is a book which draws the reader into Scully's nightmare remarkably well, while still allowing us the luxury of sitting back and admiring Winton's intricate crafting of words and emotions."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"I am not at all surprised by the wildly different customer responses to this novel, because my own response to it was mixed. I found the writing dense and surprising and beautiful. I loved the first section (in Ireland). The second section (in Greece) tested my affection for the narrator as well as my ability to suspend my disbelief and follow these two characters across Europe. At times, the daughter's silence (and the father's unwillingness to test it) seemed more like a plot device than a believable human response. Despite these criticisms, I was still pulled into the beauty of the language and the dark search for the missing wife. All in all, it was one of the strangest books I've ever read. It was kind of like a darker version IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS. I read it for the book club I'm in. We meet next Thursday, and I'll be interested to hear the others' reactions and to discuss the things in the book which still remain a mystery to me."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Scully, a man I saw but did not get to know, nor his lover, who leaves him without explination.

Along the way, through Greece, Ireland, Australia and France, Scully learns more about his marriage than he would ever have guessed...With sensual descriptive passages and vivid, unforgettable characters, this novel will grab hold of you and won't let go until the last page is turned.P.S.

Mr. Winton's characters are tremendouslyengaging and his dialogue believable and articulate.Moments of real humor and good will shine through thisstory of desperation and loss.

Winton's novel should comewith a Government Warning: Reading this book is addictive!"},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It's an interesting premise but the book sets the reader up for something and then totally fails to deliver on it. You learn nothing that you didn't already know at the start, which is nothing.You spend the first eighty pages or so with Scully fixing up his house in Ireland for his seven-year-old daughter and wife who are supposedly coming to meet him. Eighty pages of him scrubbing, grouting, plastering, shoveling, painting, broken by some chatty interludes with a minor character Peter Keneally. Unless you're Joyce or Nabokov or Proust there is no way to make these mundane activities compelling for eighty pages. I would have forgiven Winton at forty pages, but at eighty it's just too dull and the attempt at plot build-up totally off kilter.Finally, the first climax comes: Scully goes to pick up his wife and child at the airport and only the child emerges from the plane. Where is his wife? We all want to know, of course, as we've spent eighty pages waiting for her and listening to Winton tell us how much Scully is looking forward to it, but his daughter won't tell him, despite the fact that Winton gives us a brief scene with the child on the airplane (which airplane is just another one of the unsolved mysteries in this book) with her mother, so we KNOW at some point the child was with her. Billie, his daughter, will never tell him, and after a while, for no reason that I can possibly discern, other than Winton's attempt to keep up the novelty of \\"suspense\\", Scully stops asking her about it. Would you do this as a parent? Wouldn't you find some way to coax this vital info out of your seven-year-old child? But I guess the info isn't so important to Winton.Scully then decides, as though he's a private detective -- why he doesn't spend his money on a professional we'll never know, but then Winton wouldn't have a novel -- to go look for her. And he takes his daughter with him! Imagine that! A guy dragging his seven-year-old all around Europe. (Nobody in the novel even questions how abusive and unfair this is -- even after the girl suffers a vicious dog attack.) Scully flocks to Greece where he meets a variety of extremely frustrating drunks and bohemians who REFUSE to answer a question directly or provide him (or us) with any tangible information. The story at this point becomes Monty Pythonish, it's so absurd. Here is a desperate man looking for his wife and a cynical friend just toys with him: \\"Where is she?\\" \\"She? She?\\" \\"Come on Arthur. [...].\\" \\"Oh dear.\\"Winton deliberately tantalizes us with the bare bones of a thriller without giving us any of the meat such a genre requires. Why? Is he being postmodern? That could be his defense, but then why does he try so hard at being \\"realistic\\"?Then Scully meets a woman, Irma, en route to Italy, who, based ona photo she plucks from his wallet, claims she saw his wife at a hotel in Greece with another woman. Aha, the reader says. Finally, a morsel of information -- we're halfway through the book now -- might be given. Another false lead. Scully doesn't believe her, I guess because Irma's a bit of a floozy, and so he hardly probes into the idea of his wife being with a woman, hardly probes into any idea at all and yet insists on going from city to city of his expat past with his daughter. He refuses to pack it in.Other coincidences abound that leave you and the characters NOWHERE and with NO ANSWERS. Scully finds himself a murder suspect in Greece, but he flees before any authority has a chance to apprehend him. Why this intrigue? An attempt to keep the pages turning, I guess. A telegram is sent to an Amex office in Florence, purportedly from his wife, telling him to meet him in Paris. She doesn't show. Was it a hoax? Why doesn't she come? Don't expect answers.I found this book to be contrived, implausible, and in the end, utterly frustrating. Scully's relationship with his wife, with his past, who he thought she was, who he thinks he is, are not remotely explored, not even superficially a la Paul Auster, and are certainly not dramatized. Scully's entire \\"voyage\\" has no point, no catharsis, no resolution. It's a big shaggy dog story.There are strengths: some of the prose is brisk and effective, the secondary characters are quite good and memorable, especially Peter Keneally and Irma, etc. The dialogue is top-notch, and unlike the story, real.It just fails to add up to a story."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Tim Winton's &quot;The Riders&quot;, a Booker Prize nominee, is one of the most impressive novels I have read all year. It is a brilliantly crafted and expertly executed literary achievement by one of Australia's most promising modern young writers. Preparing to start a new life with his wife Jennifer and young daughter Billie in Ireland, Scully's life is blown apart when he goes to the airport to meet his family but finds only Billie and no message from his missing wife. With Billie in tow, he travels to Greece, France and the Netherlands in search of Jennifer but unbeknown to himself begins a journey of self discovery that will alter the course of his life in ways he never envisaged. The Scully you meet in the first few chapters, giddy with happiness and anticipation as he toils to make habitable a ramshackle old place he has bought to begin a new life with his family, is so &quot;up&quot; and vibrant a life force, you feel a palpable sense of hurt watching his slide downhill. But redemption awaits around the corner. While Jennifer, a shadowy figure, remains an enigma, her disappearance forces Scully to come to terms with feelings of betrayal and to recognise that it is perhaps impossible to truly know another human being. The unknowability of the human heart, arguably the novel's central theme, is powerfully captured in the recurring image of riders on white horses, all spendiferously dressed, but still and silent and oblivious to all as they line up for parade in the night. The gradual role reversal we witness in the adult-child relationship between Scully and Billie only deepens the sense of pathos evoked by new circumstances as they unfold. Billie, quiet and uncommunicative, but who proves ultimately to be the quicker learner of life's lessons, ends up taking charge. She quite literally controls the purse strings by the end of the story. Winton's language is colourful and he uses imagery to dazzling effect. His minor characters (eg, Irma, Alex and Pete) are also memorable. They remain sharply etched in our minds long after they have been written out of the plot. Irma, arguably Scully's saviour, may be a damaged soul but she possesses the essence of humanity absent from the sophisticated but calculating Jennifer. &quot;The Riders&quot; is such a rare and haunting beauty of a novel I can only recommend other readers to take their time enjoying it. Richly deserving of its Booker Prize award nomination. Go get it !"},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Now I would hate to rubbish Tim Wintons latest tome outright because frankly, it was a compelling read. I couldn't put it down till I had turned the last page, this is true. However this urgency was inspired more by my desperation to get the tale of doom and gloom over and done with, then out of a desire to gallop along with the protagonist to an enlightening conclusion.Wintons novel is no less then a Victorian tale of melodrama and sentimentality. Charlie boy would have been proud! The protagonist -- Scully, is introduced as a pathetic, doting husband, all too earnest and well intentioned. We know from the start that he is a victim having been abandoned by his wife to bring up little daughter Billy (echoes of Oliver, little Dorrit and poor Joe haunt her characterisation) in a ruined Irish cottage. The novel follows his frantic scramble across Europe searching for his illusive spouse with little Billy knocking along behind with resolute maturity. Clearly she is the real victim and one might even be inspired to feel sympathy for her if it weren't for the overwhelming metaphors and allegories and several lashings of pathos.Everything that can happen to this desperate pair, does happen, till the reader is simply overloaded and exasperated. Scully is quite the anti hero -- with his disfigured face, wounded eye and scarred builders hands. Co incidentally Billies favourite comic is Victor Hugos' 'Hunch Back of Notre Dame'. It is hardly surprising then that on a cold Christmas night in Paris, Scully (drunk and penniless) is persuaded to take refuge in the Cathedral by his pleading daughter? Bells tolling about their heads...The laboured metaphors plod through the body of the book till at the last moment what better symbol to sum up failure then the proverbial sinking ship.By this stage I was crying for mercy!Now to be fair to Charles Dickens who is one of the great classical writers, there is a place for Victorian Melodrama -- even today. What surprises me is that The Riders was short listed for the Booker Prize in 1995. I find it astounding when you see how much intelligent, sensitive, modern literature goes unnoticed in the marketplace today, that The Riders should be singled out for such praise.My opinion of the Booker Prize has waned somewhat I fear."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"THE RIDERS By Tim Winton A HARD RIDEFred Scully is not what you would term a romantic hero in the traditional sense of the word. He is more of a stumble bum/antihero, the kind you would probably avoid eye contact with. In the skilful hands of Winton however, he assumes epic proportions as he struggles to reclaim his shattered life.An expatriate Australian, he has worked diligently to set up his new home in Ireland in preparation for the return of his wife and daughter from Western Australia. However when the fateful day arrives only his daughter is there to meet him at Shannon airport. Scully is as dumbfounded as the authorities as to the whereabouts of his wife Jennifer.Thus begins a tale or two as Scully and Billie try to trace her movements across Europe. It is a Europe far removed from popular fiction. This is a Europe of the downtrodden and the dispossessed, the avant garde of the New Order. Scully battles prejudice, greed and apathy in his attempts to discover Jennifer's whereabouts and in the process discovers love in the most unlikely place. The relationship between father and daughter is a series of defining moments that takes the idol of the sensitive new age guy and lays him to rest. Here is earthiness and tenderness once denied the snag, skillfully and artfully told.A powerful read, it is a tribute to Winton that he has captured the entire continent in the scope of a novel such as The Riders. I found it impossible to put down.Written by Alastair Rosie"},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"Winton is clearly an outstanding writer. I could not put this book down, and yet I continually felt a little at sea, wishing someone would explain to me what was going on. The book is written with such passion that the reader enters into a kind of situational madness, in which she or he descends with the protagonist, Scully, into the emotionally-charged confusion brought about when his wife disappears. Apparently she has abandoned him and their child, but why, and for what? Scully chases around Europe with their child as he tries to find his wife and the answers to these questions. I only wish Winton had cleared up more of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"I just finished The Riders last night; I stayed up for most of the night finishing it, actually. I still cannot decide if I actually liked it -- I know the story didn't have a good resolution and I know I had a lot of unanswered questions when I put the book down, but I'm still trying to figure out whether or not this is a book I enjoyed.The story was interesting, for sure. A mother abandons husband and child without explanation or clues, and the reason for her leaving is never truly addressed in the novel. The reader gets hints at where she might be: is she in Greece, at the beck and call of an expat painter past his prime? Is she cavorting around with another woman? Is she in Paris, teasing her husband and child with promises of a meeting and a full disclosure? Or is she in Amsterdam, living in a dilapidated houseboat? Around Paris, the reader realizes that Scully (the husband) is on a futile quest, even though he himself cannot see that. As he tumbles further and further into a psychotic state, his small daughter Billie attempts to hold him together. She, too, knows that the mother will never be found, and she doesn't really care.At the beginning of the novel, I sympathized with Scully, and I wanted him to find resolution. As the novel progressed, however, I was irritated by him -- I wanted him to take his damaged daughter back to Ireland and for them to give up the quest that was driving him mad. Better yet, they should have returned to Australia, back to a place they knew.So this is an interesting book, and a riveting read. But there's so much left unsaid that it's really difficult to \\"enjoy,\\" because you are not left satisfied at all. You don't want the book to continue, but you'd love to see an \\"epilogue\\" that tells you what really happened to Jennifer, if Scully and Billie stayed in Ireland, what happened to the expat painter, what happened to the strange Irma... most of all, however, you want to understand the significance of the book's title, and the mysterious \\"Riders\\" who make their appearance twice in the book without further development.A strange book, overall."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"In reading some of the first reviews I feel many persons may have missed what I believe is the heart of this story. This books enters the depth of total disillusionment. Scully's search to find answers drives him to the point of insanity and is a tale of deep betrayal and the search for answers that will never come, leaving the choice to continue the search (the Riders or Pete's brother Conor) unending. It is as Pete put it: \\"There are things that have no finish, Scully, no endin to speak of. There's no justice to it, but that's the God's truth.

Believing his wife to have abandoned him and their daughter for a reason, Scully goes on a chase of rampange in pursuit of a shapeless promise and nameless due. A compelling tale into the deep realm of one man's psyche, Winton does a fabulous job penetrating through the surface of reality in search of the source of a deadly obsession. Dragging his 7-year-old daughter by his side, The Riders is also a tale of love, of what little is remained of a family unity. Only through his love buried in his own troubled spirit, does Scully rises above a maze of deception painted by his own blind obsession. A mystery with no ending, be prepared to find yourself in owe of the ungraspable nature of human nature."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"This book, while not perfect, definitely holds the reader's attention from beginning to end. The main character, Scully, is a modern-day Quasimodo, a misfit in a world of masks and deception, someone who has but sheer will and a good heart--and a savagely loving daughter--to go on. His quest to find his wife who has apparently abandoned her husband and daughter is a dramatic, at times breathless, depiction of what it's like to realize one knows little about those one thought one knew the most. The writing occasionally annoyed me (too self-conscious at times for my taste) but I was willing to let it slide, so harrowing did I find Scully's journey. And as much as I adore Paris, having lived there a year I must, h&eacute;las, attest to the accuracy of his less-then flattering portrait of the City of Light."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"This book gave me a unique opportunity to evaluate my position as a reader.. is it a spectator sport or am I a participant in the ring with the characters.. &quot;All for one, and one for all&quot; is Scully's motto, and his tailspin adventure with he and his daugher in search of the woman whom abandoned them both include those brave enough take the dive down with him to feel the desparation and frustration of loss for reasons unknown. It isn't a book that we can close with a clean, crisp ending. It will unnerve you to know end as you wonder what the hell happened, just as Sully will wonder for the rest of his life. The very real character trudge through this tale of loss, and redemption in unexpected forms. It's not a story to be taken for face value where the details are dim, but for the deeper, darker lessons, which are painful enough in real life that we can't even bear in a book!

My book club picked this book, but being an ardent reader, I was excited to read something by an acclaimed author I was unfamiliar with.I guess we have to start with the title subject, the mysterious Riders in the night. What an original idea! Not! Ok, normally I like symbolism, yes, let's think a little. But I became so annoyed with the wild, meaningless chase across Europe. Angry at Scully's abuse of his daughter, who is both psychologically and physically scarred. I'm practically cheering when the police arrest Scully, finally someone will rescue Billy. But no, Winton keeps dragging us along, to an answer of what happened to Scully's wife, nope, we have another date with the Riders. So what do we have, some hacked symbolism, with a big dose of alcohol, child abuse, and no plot. Maybe the author had best come to deal with his own demons.There is no redemption in this book, unless Amazon will give me my money back.

It is worth the ride."},{"Title":"The Riders (ISIS Large Print)","review":"The book was spell-binding. I enjoyed the romance between Skully and his wife and the depth of his love for her even when it becomes obvious that she is gone for good. I enjoyed the reference to the fact that beauty is only skin deep. The relationship between Billie and her physically unattractive father was very deep and meaningful. Then, Billie becomes scarred for life after her encounter with the dog and her loss of physical beauty doesn't seem to bother her since she focuses more on inner beauty. It is the woman of physical beauty who betrays her family. I like the comparisons to the Hunch Back of Notre Damn in the book as well. Billie seems to see him as her hero and aspires to develop her inner beauty. I find myself perplexed about the ghost riders? Were they similar souls that lost the loves of their lives? Were they people who never found what they were looking for on this earth? I don't know. Does anyone out there have an idea for me? It is a book that is difficult for me to get out of my mind.

Still, for quick results and homes that look great on a rock bottom budget, this one can't be beat. It takes a certain skill to see your home with fresh eyes, know what to toss or store and what to keep, what paint to use to update your tired or dingy walls and how to style your home for the greatest effect. This book shows you how.I couldn't believe how some of the \\"ugly duckling\\" rooms could actually look stylish. Clive Pearse, LIsa LaPorta, Donna Freeman and Shannon Freeman (who all worked on this book) have talent!Features include:1. Plenty of full-color photos, including close-ups of key elements. Nice graphics, easy to read, very user friendly.2. An eye on the budget. There are cost breakdowns for any improvements or materials such as paint, window treatments and accessories.3. An awareness of what sellers want. They KNOW you don't want to sink any more money into your home than you have to before you sell it and move on to your next home. They know you DO want to sell it for the best price possible. And if you can spend between $500 and $2000 and end up with $50,000 or more profit than comparable homes on the market....why not go for it?4. Ideas for showcasing shelves, bookcases and architectural features.5. Tips on lighting, creating drama, directing the eye to prime features (fireplaces, built-ins, chandeliers).Great bang for your buck!"},{"Title":"Designed to Sell: Make any home the hottest property on the block with expert advice from the popular HGTV series","review":"The ideas put forth in this book are simple and common sense, yet many were things I hadn't thought of. After living in my house for 5 years there were so many things I just didn't see any more and this book really helped me take a look through someone else's eyes. It is good for overall ideas, and reasonably good at specifics, though I often found myself wondering, \\"Just how did they do that?\\" They are very good at pointing out that though the investment in paint and furniture seems expensive, you should put it into perspective against how much more the house is worth with the changes.I did not give this book 5 stars because of the budget feature, which is completely unrealistic. I don't know where I could buy all new living and dining room furniture for $663, especially not of the quality shown. In one feature on a bedroom they added a bed and a dresser, yet the budget did not include furniture. I really hate things like this in books because it diminishes my respect for the authors' and their other ideas.So, get it, read it, but use your common sense. Be inspired, but you'll have to be creative on your own to stay within the budget!"},{"Title":"Designed to Sell: Make any home the hottest property on the block with expert advice from the popular HGTV series","review":"If you're a fan of the show, you'll probably love this book. It has lots of large colorful pictures and nice bios of the stars. (Did you know Shannon Freeman is Donna Freeman's daughter? I didn't.)The Pros:* Lots of pretty pictures.* A quick read.* Bios of the Designed to Sell Team* Lots of pretty pictures.The Cons:* Not much in the way of ideas of techniques.* Too many pretty pictures.The bulk of this book is a recap of various shows they've done. Unless your house is similar to one of their shows, you won't find much.Personally, I found \\"Buying for Profit\\" from the folks at Property Ladder to be chock full of useful ideas for updating your home and preparing a property for sale."},{"Title":"Designed to Sell: Make any home the hottest property on the block with expert advice from the popular HGTV series","review":"I watch \\"Designed to Sell\\" every night - sometimes even the reruns! I looked forward to getting the book but was a bit disappointed about the book's layout. For one thing, on some of the pages they use very small print with a font color that almost matches the background of the photo on the page. I actually had to go back through the book at one point because I had missed some of the write-ups once I realized what they did.Moreover, many of the pictures were too small. Rather than show a picture of Clive with Donna or Shannon, why not a larger \\"before\\" picture so the reader could get a better idea of what they were critiquing? It would have allowed for more of the room to be shown. In one living room, they discussed how bad a rail looked, yet there wasn't a picture to show what they were talking about.The book also repeats (and repeats) some of what is discussed on the show - remove clutter and clean thoroughly. This got a bit tedious as the book progressed, but could be helpful for someone who's never seen the show.All in all, I'd say that I enjoyed the book. I bought the book because it was recommended by Clive's assistant, Katie Spelling, when I inquired about a specific vanity top (I wanted to know where they got such a nice one for only $280). The book lists their sources - including stock numbers and descriptions - in the back. If you are a regular viewer of the show, I don't know that it's worth buying as you probably already know most of their tips: declutter, clean, paint, update fixtures, etc. If you've never or rarely watched it, you will learn a lot about staging your house."},{"Title":"Designed to Sell: Make any home the hottest property on the block with expert advice from the popular HGTV series","review":"I'm a big fan of the Designed to Sell TV series hosted by the ever witty Clive Pearse and the enthusiastic Lisa La Porta, a duo who managed to make home improvement a fun and entertaining TV watch.The book of the show makes a great companion to the series. It's layout is clear and concise with great photography. Based around some of the best projects from the series it is full of useful tips and hints, not only on home design but also on everything from choosing a real estate agent to conquering clutter.It also contains more detail than the series of how much extra money the homeowners made as a result of their outlay. Spending $2000 to update and improve your home and getting offers of $26,000 above the asking price as a result certainly shows the power of 'speculate to accumulate' !

Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Designed to Sell: Make any home the hottest property on the block with expert advice from the popular HGTV series","review":"The book, like the show, is invaluable whether you will actually sell your house or not. More than one \\"seller\\" has changed from seller to keeper or rental owner because of how well the renovation turned out, and that is okay, too. The principal idea is to take a long, hard look at your dear little abode and see it more as others may see it. Clutter abounds, dirt has made itself at home in hard to reach places, repairs have been put off, etcetera! This book, like the program, will help you to sort out these problems, but many of the costs are not realistic: they hide some subterfuge.Just for starters, I have never seen a cost entered for labor. Where the program is concerned, we know, or should know, that all labor is provided by the crew, who are on contract to the show. Furthermore, the work for the show is always completed on time and professionally well done. In real life, however, we have the problem of finding qualified, honest and trustworthy contractors/workmen who will charge us fairly for a job done well. None of this is dealt with in the program or in the book. Perhaps that part is \\"another story?\\"If anyone goes into a remodeling/renovation project with only $2000 to spend, they had better have some talented and willing family or friends as well as being able to do some/most of the work themselves. As for the \\"new\\" furniture, it would be more helpful if the sources were mentioned. It is quite acceptable to purchase furniture from outlets and \\"used\\" stores at serious savings. However, these sources are not always available everywhere, and that, in all fairness, should be pointed out. This is my only criticism of the show and the book. The ideas are there and the needed jobs layed out, but the money is not realistic. Still, the book is worth the time to read it and the money to buy it - used."},{"Title":"Designed to Sell: Make any home the hottest property on the block with expert advice from the popular HGTV series","review":"I liked this book a lot. It is easy to read and moves well. They have a lot of ideas, concepts, tips, hints and other useful and current information for home sellers. They don't go into a lot of facts and figures on specific values of each improvement or change - but since that is market specific, I'm not sure how they could. The only negative I have is that the Before and After pictures are rather small and often show the room from different views so it's hard to see the entire before/after effect. They have step by step instructions for several of the most common and most valuable projects that are very useful for the novice. The ideas range from complex and dramatic changes to very simple low/no budget fixes.

The country has returned to slavery, and is ruled by Haze-Gaunt, the Chancellor. Haze-Gaunt is an avid fencer. Sword fighting has become common again, thanks to his ongoing struggle with the Thieves, who have vowed to use any and all means to rid the country of slavery. The Thieves cannot be harmed by gunfire, due to personal force fields they have created, which act like body armor. Slow moving weapons, such as swords, still can harm them.Alar has no memory of his own past, beyond the previous 5 years. His first memory is climbing out of a river, near the site of a crashed space ship. When he becomes the focus of a concerted manhunt by the Imperial military, he realizes that his true identity must be of importance. He has strange powers, of which he doesn't understand the nature or origin. As the story unfolds, the pace quickens to a fantastic conclusion, involving time travel and transcendental metamorphosis. Humankind become the prize for the victorious side - Alar and the Thieves or Haze-Gaunt.The story is imaginative, if lacking in convincing or understandable details. Alar's trip to the sun in a floating, refrigerated space station is an example. His powers are another example of creative ideas, which are unconvincingly told. The writing is efficient, but not outstanding. Characters exist mostly to fill roles, and are not explored beyond that. Shey is an Imperial psychologist, with a sadistic personality. He serves as the darkest, and most feared character of all. His demise is surprising and fitting, and is one of many surprises along the way.This is a book of strengths and weaknesses, each jockeying for position every handful of pages. The strengths win out in a close contest. If you want a straight-forward story, told in an easily understandable manner, then avoid this. If you like an occasional reading exercise, requiring your full attention and interest, then this is worth your time. There are several rewarding images described in the story. Enjoy the images, but don't use a magnifying glass. The details are less attractive than the whole."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"A rolliking good ride, exquisitely written, engrossing, huge character development- this is simply a good story. Paradox Men will leave you breathless and wanting more. Harness engages in some very interesting temporal philosophy, as he looks at when things went wrong. While some of the resolution is predictable, it is also exactly what must be within the world view of the story. Other bits of the ending will never be what you expect. This myth is complete.The book however falls short on the science part of science fiction. The basic reasoning behind why events occurs is presented in incredibly complex physics equations. (Yes, there are actually equations in the book.) Either they are technobabble, or they are so complex that only a physicist could actually follow them. I do however know that the biology presented is very off. Harness makes a couple very common errors of laymen when it comes to evolution, arguing that it is possible to find some sort of deus ex machina to transport a person to a higher state of evolution. Similarly it is possible to \\"de-evolve\\".Yet evolution doesn't have higher or lower states of evolution. It simply has organisms adapted to their environment. We are no higher (biologically speaking) than an anemone or an amoeba. We are adapted to different environments. This means that, in order to change, there must be different environments and there must be a good deal of time to adapt. We never \\"de-evolve\\", any more than a whale did when returning to the sea- we become re-adapted, but with very different structures. And most importantly, an individual never, never evolves. Populations evolve. Species evolve. Individuals compete and give birth and die.Unfortunately, Paradox Men is based on these false scientific premises. If you can get past them, I highly recommend the book, for simply being a very good story."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"Harness said that he put into The Paradox Men every idea that he had, and that's why it's such a rich feast. One reviewer here points to a plot loophole that actually is clearly explained in the novel. The only glitch I recall is a minor one, where Harness puts sonar as part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Otherwise, a masterful job. Track it down and read it."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"I've heard a fair amount about this book. It put out a fair amount of ideas other books would use. I hear it's about time travel ,in part, that must be a real fascination of his. The only thing of his I read was a story in a June '97 issue of Asimov's. His later work's unavailable in the U.K., but you maybe able to find &quot;The Ring of Ritornel&quot;."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"I picked up this book because it had been compared to Alfred Bester's &quot;The Stars, My Destination,&quot; one of my favorite sci-fi novels, AND because it is listed as one of the Top 100 sci-fi novels in David Pringle's excellent overview book. Happily, I found the comparison to be a fair one, and the rating to be just. This is one terrific science fiction novel, as fast paced and colorful as the Bester novel, and featuring a similar use of colorful characters and extravagant imagination. It is really quite impressive how Charles Harness manages to incorporate some fantastic surprise or bit of mind-blowing scientific hypothesizing into every single chapter. Einsteinian theories of the universe, Toynbeean history and non-Aristotelian philosophy are all mixed into a swashbuckling and fast-moving pulp story, with a backdrop of a technologically advanced society on the decline. The story jumps from the Earth to the moon to Mercury and finally to a &quot;solarion,&quot; a station that hovers over a sunspot to process the energy of the sun itself. It's all wild and improbable and quite irresistible stuff, if you're game. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"This is one of those stories that has several mysterious buried in the plot that all come together at the very end. The premise is exceptional and the look that we get into a future imperial America is fascinating. Unfortunately the plot seems uneven in places. As an example a character who gets tortured at the end of one chapter suddenly reappers free in the middle of the next chapter with little explaination of what happened in between. The book is full of small &quot;problems&quot; like this and that makes it a bit annoying to read. Also the explaination of the structure of the universe is confusing and requires you to read it over several times. That said, the time travel plot is incredible and will leave you thinking about it for days after the book is done. My favorite part of this book, though, is the description of the solar bases and the sociology of what goes on there. Yeah, you heard me right they have bases on the sun in this book. If you want to find out why and how such a thing is possible read the book. Overall it is a good read."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"The Paradox Men has become a classic in the SF field, for good reason. It was first published as \\"Flight Into Yesterday\\", in the May 1949 Startling Stories. This edition is slightly expanded and revised.The Paradox Men is still Harness's most famous and most respected novel. The plot is complicated, but consistent, logical, and thematically sound. The characters are two-dimensional but interesting and involving. The action is well-done, and the scientific ideas are sometimes philosophical and thoughtful, and at other times wild, implausible, but still engaging. The basic story is of a Thief, Alar, who has appeared in Imperial America 5 years prior to the action of the story, with no memory of his past or identity. The Thieves work underground against the repressive society, using tech invented by their mysterious, dead, founder, Kennicot Muir. The key piece of Thief tech is armor which protects them against high velocity weapons (like projectile weapons), but not against swords and knives. Thus fencing is again a major skill. (Herbert swiped this notion for Dune, of course.) At the time of the action, various threads are converging: the plans of Imperial America to attack its Eurasian enemy, the Toynbee society's attempts to avoid the continuing historical cycle of civilizations rising and falling (they believe that the coming war will bring Toynbee Civilization 21 to an end: the next one will be Toynbee 22, hence Harness' original title (never used on a published version): Toynbee Twenty-Two), the completion of an experimental FTL starship, the relationship between the evil leaders of Imperial America and Keiris Muir, the enslaved widow of Kennicot Muir, and her attraction to Alar, the predictions of the computer enhanced human called The Meganet Mind (or the Microfilm Mind in the original). What a horrible sentence: but trying to summarize Harness can do that to you. Everything comes to a head with a trip to the surface of the Sun, and then a much stranger trip ...I recommend it highly. It seems comparable in many ways to its near contemporary Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination: Harness probably had a more original mind than Bester's, and his themes seem a bit more ambitious, but he really couldn't write with him -- and I think it is because of the writing (both prose and pace) that the manic energy of the Bester book is more successfully sustained. Still, The Paradox Men remains a powerful and interesting novel, and such scenes as the final selfless act of Keiris are unmatched in SF."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"The Paradox Men(1953) by Charles Harness - 202 pages - rating: 6.5/10This IS classic time travel / space opera Sci-Fi. There's no question of that. There are some very interesting components to the plot that many people will enjoy. I know I did.There are also some odd elements that feel overly bizarre. For example, one of the characters has the capability to project deceptive visual images OUT OF HIS EYEBALLS. Weird eh ? Keep in mind this was written in 1953 and back then authors were encouraged to do new and unusual things in writing science fiction.My major complaint, and its not a big one, is in delivery department. Harness seems to enjoy inserting unusual words quite frequently. It's as if he feels he'll raise the literary quality by doing so. Often the words dont quite fit or are so uncommon that you need to look them up in a dictionary. His sentance structure is not quite ideal either. The combination of these two factors make the reading a little unsmooth, a little awkward. While you're reading the story you do want to know what happens next but you are not drawn into the story in a compelling way.In his introductory remarks the editor compares Paradox Men to The Stars My Destination(1956 - 8.5/10) by Alfred Bester and The Sirens of Titan(1959 - 8.0/10) by Kurt Vonnegut jr. Let me tell you there is NO COMPARISON to those two novels. Paradox Men is not even on the same level.For massively enjoyable/funny alternate reality Sci-Fi also try What Mad Universe(1949 - 9.0/10) by Fredric Brown. The Black Cloud(1957 - 9.5/10) by Fred Hoyle is also excellent (one of my favorites) if you enjoy Science Fiction where the main protagonist is a scientist himself.The Paradox Men was OK but there's lots out there that are better.Claus Kellermann2006 January 3Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"It is not a long book, around a few hundred pages and if I do have any complaint, it might be that it could have been longer, which actually speaks to how much I enjoyed reading it. But, it is a product of its time and one of the reasons I love classic SF so much, the ability to write short, concise novels, filled with action and adventure that very few modern SF novels can match.Time travel and evolution, power and corruption, mystery and intrigue, science and discovery, love and loss, it is all here in this short novel and it works and by the end when revelations are made, I have to confess I got them wrong, which is always fun for me.It moves with tremendous energy and in many ways it is very much like Alfred Bester's works and I think it is just as good. I cannot speak about Charles Harness' other novels but I will be reading more of them in another volume of his works called Rings, which does include The Paradox Men and three other novels.It starts on Earth, goes to the Moon and we actually end up on the surface of the Sun, in what has to be one of the most memorable scenes I have read in a long time.If you can find a used copy, pick it up and enjoy. I loved it."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"Glad I picked this for my summer classic SF reading. This short read builds a mysterious story with interesting characters. The 2nd third of this novel is painfully hard to put down. A very plot driven SF novel about the impact of science on human nature, what a concept. Fascinating, Charles Harness was a great writer. The main female character in this story is smart and breaks the tradition of hopeless cookie cutter clueless girls featured in so many other SF books. The dialog is far from cheesy as well. As a futuristic novel, some things do not hold up to the test of time, I think they were very limited...like tape as data storage or lack of cell phones. A thought-provoking and fun read that I'm hoping becomes a movie."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"I read this book when it was first published and have never forgotten the plot. I just recently re-read it and found it just as absorbing as the first time! The vision and scope of the author place this book on a short list of masterworks! An exciting narration covers such concepts as multiple identities, time travel, superhuman evolution and carnival freaks. I would not want to harm the reader's enjoyment in unraveling the mysteries of the plot by revealing more here. Suffice it to say that Charles Harness is an acknowledged master of storytelling skills and unlimited imagination."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"The Paradox Men is a very engrossing read. I, of course, love to read what's been written on the covers of books (not just the pictures, though if the pictures are cool enough, they still get me!), and this one proclaimed itself to be a masterpiece. And after reading all the introductions by various important people I've never really heard of (other than Asimov), I had pretty high expectations for this work.Well, it almost lived up to them. I was engrossed and really had problems putting it down (I really shouldn't stay up that late to read if I have to work the next morning...). Harness's pacing is excellent, almost manic at times, and I really was becoming fascinated with the characters as they grew, evolved and were revealed.I guess the finale was anti-climactic to me. I had kinda of guessed it already, but wasn't sure if things were going to really play out that way. I think a twist away from that almost inevitable ending would have been a little more brilliant, or may just more intriguing. [spoiler alert!] And the move for the primary character to all of a sudden super-evolve (or whatever you want to call it) seemed a little over the top for me. And using this leap in evolution to then paint an almost poignant ending seemed a little too much in my mind. Almost had an incredible conclusion, but just missed it.Would I recommend it? Yes, kind of. Mainly to individuals who enjoy sci-fi and also enjoy thinking about the concepts and sociological analysis many sci-fi writers engage in within their stories. I think this is an excellent example of science fiction in it's early years - and an extremely fine example of that.I would still rather sit down with an Asimov in hand. Now there is an example of an incredible writer!"},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"'The Paradox Men' seems almost to be the Brigadoon of SF. It gets republished about every 15 years or so, generally with a foreword by some reputable author saying how great it is, and what a shame that it has been out of print. And they are quite right.'The Paradox Men' is quite a short novel, but it simply bursts with ideas, like Van Vogt, but Harness is much better at integrating the diverse strands into a coherent and wonderous tapestry. Imperial America (remember this was written about 50 years before George the Worst oozed onto the scene), Toynbee's ideas on cyclic history, the re-appearance of swords for personal defence, debt slavery, sociology on a solar energy mining station. a ship that circumnavigated the universe(accumulating sufficient mass to move galaxies), and evolutionary change. Operatically, there are masks, hidden identities and torture. We sweep between the highs(a ball at the Imperial Court) and lows(bond slavery). Approaching the end, World War III (or perhaps IV or V) is happening, yet Harness still manages a hope fulled end. The writing is also that of a literate craftsman, well-versed in the use of such tools. (Harness was a lawyer and writes well). I think he was a patent lawyer, so his knowldge of science is good enough for sf, but he brings a sure grasp of the humanities to the mix as well.\\"The Paradox Men\\" should be considered essential in a well rounded SF collection. Besides, it is just such a good read."},{"Title":"The paradox men,","review":"This Harness classic form the forties is like the best novel A.

Similar to Ms. Shepard's \\"African Accents\\", the decorating and crafts projects are described clearly with easy-to-follow instructions. The beautiful photographs are a pleasure to look through and provide creative inspiration to show how anyone could use the stylish, yet practical decorating ideas in this book to accent their own personal style.This book is a definite must-have item for anyone with decorative fabric sitting on a shelf just waiting to be used. One of my favorite projects, the Japanese Print Accent Fan, was the perfect centerpiece for my table at Thanksgiving. My next project will be an Indonesian Batik Pillow. \\"Global Expressions\\" provides excellent guidance to anyone wishing to create a \\"Global Eclectic\\" d&eacute;cor for their home, while also being informative on the cultural and historical significance of the crafts and artistry of diverse cultures throughout the world.

Today's Chinese &quot;Communist&quot; Party viciously slanders the achievements of collective agriculture in the community Dazhai and the visionary leader Chen Yonggui who helped to make it a success. Yet thousands of people, both Chinese and foreign, saw for themselves the development of this once backward village into a thriving, highly productive agricultural community. It prospered until the early 1980s, when it was forcibly disbanded by the central government. The effects of decollectivisation were dramatic and criminal: in 1987, Dazhai, formerly a prosperous collective, was not able to feed itself.Qin Huailu is to be applauded for having the courage to record this important period of history in the face of oppression by the current counterrevolutionary r&eacute;gime. The accomplishments of Chen Yonggui and Dazhai will not be forgotten."},{"Title":"How to Retire Without Retreating","review":"Johnnie Godwin's book is a rare gem. He leaves advice about the financial aspects of the retirement transition to financial experts, but rather focuses on how a retiree can prepare mentally for the change of pace which occurs with retirement. I followed his advice to \\"take a sabbatical\\" immediately following retirement. He's not talking about a trip or a rigorous study focus, but a time in which the retiree can reflect on what's important now. A sabbatical allows a little room to breathe before the calendar and schedule begin to overflow with commitments. He speaks specifically to men and women of faith who want to make the retirement season of their lives count for something in service to God. I read Johnnie's book a couple of times before I retired, and at least once following my last day of a long career. I've also bought a copy to give to a friend who is on the verge of retirement. Good read!"},{"Title":"How to Retire Without Retreating","review":"Caveat: I'm the author of this book, which is a revision of an earlier book I wrote on retirement as life's best chapter. Other than ego, why would I review my own book? Well, because it is distinctive if not unique in its approach to retirement as a lifestyle and not one steeped in anxiety about financial matters. Further, it comes out of my own life and research and interviews with other retirees. It is a practical book that takes the slant that retirement isn't for an indulgent life that just luxuriates in selfishness; rather, it is a chapter that may be long or short but should be filled with mini-chapters of variety, flexibility, and a fine mix of personhood that reflects stewardship of all of life. I've been retired [read \\"downsized\\"] 19 years as of 2011. But within that time, I've been productive in three or four other types of careers besides life's leisure and enjoyment with my wife and family."},{"Title":"How to Retire Without Retreating","review":"Good book.

His long - reflecting lines have a depth of sensual beauty, incredible in imagery and reflection. The 'Truth is Beauty, and Beauty is Truth\\" conclusion of the great \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" could serve as motto for his verse. In the great Odes, the Nightingale Ode, Ode to Autumn, Ode on a Grecian Urn he seems to strain poetic feeling into a new dimension of pained longing. \\" Perhaps the self- same song that found a path, Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn;The same that oft-times hath Charmed magic casements, opening on the form , Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn\\" can move us magically to a sense of the vision or waking dream, the music that brings us beyond ourselves and sleep into the most sublime realm of poetry.He did die young but not before his pen had gleemed his teeming brain \\" in great lines living still today."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"To heck with Twilight.

It has a wonderful storyline, great description, and awesome characters. In fact, the only bad thing about it is there's no sequal!"},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"A young woman named Caribou who has a special gift to foresee the future. A wild young man named Reindeer who isn't a man at all. When the land of two moons becomes threatened and treacherous, it is up to these two to guide Caribou's people to safety, and a new home. Can Caribou convince the tribes to follow her beyond the burning plain where the golden reindeer go? Can she trust the shape changer she loves to guide her there?This prehistoric fantasy is a powerful tale of love and courage. Ms. Pierce always writes strong, convincing and ultimately likable heroines. The title hardly scratches the surface of this tale, and if Ms. Pierce lacks anything in her books, it is decent titles. While this story does indeed contain a bittersweet romance, it is secondary to the story of Caribou's growth from a young girl living outcast and alone with only a strange child for company to a capable and confident woman who will lead her people through the burning plain, past the Firekings and trollwomen. Caribou never falls into \\"the damsel in distress\\" role in the story, all her dealings are direct and honest. It is, in fact, this honesty that makes her such a likable and interesting character. She's not a crafty heroine; she's a leader and a teacher. She's a visionary. Reindeer fills the roll of trickster and chaos in her life, they are very much opposites. Caribou, a woman of deep emotion and direct honesty and courage. Reindeer a creature of wile and deception without a human heart. Yet each is forever bound up with the other, and the love Caribou has for Reindeer is a powerful thing.Ms. Pierce uses this setting to make observations on human society in general. The clan chief siblings who gain power, all deal with the looming end of their world in their own, ultimately futile way. One wishes only to prepare for war against an enemy. Another ascribes to the philosophy of \\"eat and drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die\\". A third believes the gods must be appeased with sacrifices and prayer. None of them heed Caribou's warnings and offer to guide them through. While these examples were handled in relatively simplistic manner, they fit within the style of the story. Ms. Pierce's lyrical style and marvelous imagery transforms this story into something that will touch the heart and capture a reader's imagination.Reader's who have loved Ms. Pierce's Darkangel Trilogy should absolutely give this one a try. If this is your first Meredith Ann Pierce story, please consider trying her Darkangel trilogy that also features a strong and likeable heroine and her quest to destroy the Darkangel who stole away her best friend. This is one not to be missed by YA readers!--Happy Reading! shanshad ^_^"},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"I had read Pierce's Darkangel Trilogy, and enjoyed it very much, but I didn't check this book out of the library the first time I saw it because I wasn't interested in a book titled \\"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer.\\" I mean, come on - a woman who loved animals? However, I finally decided to give it a try (I was desparate for reading material). Boy, was I glad I read it. I liked it so much I bought not one, but two copies of the book (because I didn't like the condition of the first one).This novel is by far my absolute favorite book. It appealed to me because of Pierce's writing style. Without you knowing it, she brings you into the story and into the character's minds and hearts (mostly the main character's, Caribou). I loved the romance - described not graphically, but brough out just as powerfully as if it was. Pierce's use of imagery, and her knack for describing feelings and actions incredibly well using few words, really empowers the storyline. A few small words, in this novel, can reveal to the reader the character's soul. There is really no good way to convey my feelings toward the way this book was written. The plot was engaging, but it was really the author's distinct writing style that made me enjoy this book so much. After all, it is my favorite book (and I've read many books of all different genres, by many excellent authors). I especially recommend this book to people who enjoy reading light romances - not as in comical, but as in more based on emotions than physical actions, if you know what I mean. You'll be able to feel and know the sorrow and love Caribou has for her daimon - a guy named Reindeer (the book wasn't exactly about animals after all ;). In any case, if you read the book - AND YOU WILL - everything will become clear. *A suggestion to the publisher: If you want people to buy your books, give them titles that aren't so misleading, please.* I can't imagine not having read this wonderful, romantic, and adventerous story. Goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover (even though people, including me, does it anyway). This book received my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"This book was spectacular. Taking place in a different world, a young woman, Caribou, raises a changling, only to fall in love with him when he leaves. When her world starts to fall apart, the young man comes back and helps her lead her people to safety. A truely excellent book, I recommend it to any fantasy lover. The characters should captivate you whether they are traveling under ground or next to a volcano."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"Can a being without a human heart learn to truly love someone. Can a woman who is an outcast lead her people to a new land. In this book you learn how these two things can happen. It all starts with a baby with golden hair and eyes, and a young woman who is forced to take care of him. As he grows up, the woman realizes that this is no ordinary human being. As he grows older, the woman truly falls in love with him, but does the young man know what love really is, can he love someone. As he is called to his own people, her people need her as well, the place that they are living is falling apart and don't know what to do. They seek out the wise woman to help them. Will she be able to help them this time. Read this wonderful book to find out the rest. When you pick up this book, make sure you have enough time to read it, I couldn't put it down after I brought it home. Like some of Pierce's other books, this one truly makes you believe in the people and the world she creates. I have read other fantasies, but none seem as real as the ones that she writes. Even though this book is out of print, I strongly suggest finding it somewhere, it was just by luck that my library had it. Read this book and find out what happens to the woman who loved Reindeer."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"Set in a prehistoric fantasy setting of ice and snow, \\"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer\\" refers to its two main characters: the young Caribou and the child she names Reindeer. As someone who experiences prophetic dreams, Caribou lives alone until her sister-in-law brings to her a golden-haired child. Claiming that it is not her husband Visjna's child (Caribou's brother), Branja begs her to take in the child - before Visjna returns from the season-long hunt and so that the child's true father cannot come to claim him.Caribou is initially disdainful of such a request, but the tiny infant soon warms her heart. Due to his love of the reindeer herds, she names him after them, and goes about raising him to the best of his ability. But soon it becomes clear that he is no ordinary child. After a terrifying run-in with a golden reindeer that results in her brother's death, Caribou begins to notice more and more abnormalities about him: he neither cries nor laughs, bleeds golden blood, has inhuman reflections, and cannot understand the concept of love. But Caribou loves him deeply, and when she begins to suspect he is one of the spirit \\"daimons\\" she is terrified that she will loose him forever. When the seasons change, he takes reindeer form in order to travel with the herds beyond the dangerous Burning Plains and the Lands of the Broken Snow.But Caribou's lands are in jeopardy with a range of natural disasters that threaten the people. Having never been particularly close to them, Caribou is prepared to depart with Reindeer to safer lands - but years of service as a wisewoman makes her sympathetic to those that come to her for help. She convinces Reindeer to lead all those who want to on the perilous journey to safety, and with her guiding dreams she leads her people onwards. But throughout the trek is her ongoing pain: on whether or not Reindeer can come to love her, and whether she can trust him to fulfil his promise.\\"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer\\" is another wonderful story from Meredith Ann Pierce, whose beautiful language, meaningful stories and rich themes make for essential reading. Her landscapes are wonderfully invoked, with everything from the languages to the details of clothing and utensils described make the entire setting a rich and realistic setting. Her use of real folklore (most of which is Scandinavian and Nordic) helps to create a sense of resonance and the feeling that this is a \`real' part of the world's mythology in her use of daimons, trollwomen, sea-maids and Firekings.Which is interesting since in terms of plot, it has several Biblical echoes - in particular Noah's Ark and the story of Moses. Caribou's people are driven from their homes by natural disasters (like the flood) and forced on a long journey to safety and freedom, which at one stage involves a land-bridge being risen above the waters (like the parting of the Red Sea). Caribou throughout is a wise and determined leader - disciplining those that deserve it, encouraging the unfaithful, and seeing through her promise no matter what the costs.Some things don't quite gel together: the move from a mother/son relationship to lovers between Reindeer and Caribou is never quite drawn out or explored properly (surprising considering the changing feelings of love is the main theme - in fact the very title - of the book) and a second love interest is introduced only to be pushed to the side. And we never really learn anything conclusive about Branja's fate. But for any fans of fantasy, storytelling, or Meredith Ann Pierce, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"Now, I must admit I was a little hesitant to read this book just from reading the title. However, I'd read quite a few of Pierce's other novels and loved almost all of them, so I thought reading this one couldn't hurt. I was glad I'd done so. It's an amazing story with some wonderfully different ideas in it. A great deviation from the every-day fantasy you read all the time and I would highly recommend this tale to anyone who likes fantasy and/or a good love story."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer","review":"I belive that I have never read a book that has enthralled me in this manner.

The heroine, Caribou, is a resourceful and realistic young woman, her interactions with her neighbors are believable, her turmoil over her relationship with her supernatural fosterling is clearly depicted -- and yet, I couldn't bring myself to care about her very much.

I think it is a wonderful introductory text to the history of education, as well as many of the schools and philosophies of thought that debate continually in American Education today. Many topics are covered that you hear about in the news and other media. Reviewing the facts on these issues (as Spring presents them terrifically) - will help you make your own decisions regarding these important issues. The text is very much a history text, and many of my colleagues had a difficulty reading through it. Many of them read the book like a textbook, and not as something that they could enjoy and actually get valuable information. Spring does a terrific job of displaying the facts of history and development of issues, and then explaining them to the fullest potential. I was fuzzy on a few educational issues, but Spring's clarity helped me understand them more completely. This book might also serve as a reference for one to go back to when an educational issue arises. Spring is continually amending the book through newer editions, so it is possible that one could use this book as a reference until the newer edition comes along. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher or thinking about going into the education profession - or anyone who is more interested in the American Schools. As a teacher, I found it very informative, and the history and statistics, overall interesting. If you aren't into the summary and digestion of statistics, this book might not be for you. I enjoyed it thoroughly however."},{"Title":"American Education -Tenth Edition","review":"This work is a usable primer for political and social issues surrounding the contemporary U.S. educational system as well as providing some background history, but is marred by mediocre composition (and editing) and some leftist bias. It also provides a general introduction to the history of minority groups in U.S. education. Should be taken with a grain of salt, but a reasonable starting-off point.Spring evinces strong opinions regarding centralized testing, and various other subjects. While certainly non-objective in multiple aspects his analysis of various themes--including testing--is nonetheless worthwhile in reminding us of the potential dangers to freedom that can arise in test-centered educational systems. In terms of flaws, Spring often makes references with less-than clear context and makes statements without evidence (e.g. publishing a 10-item list of faults with the No Child Left Behind Act by an anti-NCLB that is exaggerated and with no evidence given). Non-U.S. students may have difficulty understanding various aspects of U.S. educational history without referencing outside sources.Spring's website can be found on McGraw-Hill here, so can evaluate/sample his writings and thought further:[...]"},{"Title":"American Education -Tenth Edition","review":"The book arrived in great shape and on time.

Up-to-date information throughout the book, as well as historical aspects of education."},{"Title":"American Education -Tenth Edition","review":"Spring crafts an quality work for the most part in this book, using facts and figures to deftly illustrate the complexities that lie behind modern education, and the historical events and movements that lead to its current state. The book is constructed in two parts. The first examines the place of the school in the social setting, both in how it helps influence and, to a degree, perpetuate the larger society, and how the society influences the school, both at the local and larger scales. The second is a more detailed examination of the politics of education control, and how it influences such choices as curriculum content and textbook choices.Throughout the book, Spring uses more anecdotes and examples, both recent and historical than one can shake a stick at, but despite the potential weighing down of the book that this could cause, he keeps it interesting and informative. He also shows remarkable clarity of statistics, considering the approach he takes. Yet he never gets too enamored by them to think that they are inherently informative.I also must commend Spring for his even-handedness in presenting both sides of issues. Though one gains a knowledge of his own beliefs, which are fairly progressive, he brings up authors on both sides and raises questions they do to stimulate thinking.In the long run, however, there may be a few too many statistics, and the two parts of the book do duplicate each other at times. This is definitely not a book that one should try to read all in one sitting, as their mind would begin to overflow with numbers that aren't really meant to be memorized, just referred to when the occasion calls for it.Despite the denseness, however, Spring does a remarkable job of presenting the various issues of the day in one relatively easy to read volume."},{"Title":"American Education -Tenth Edition","review":"It's hard to have much confidence in a book that is so obviously slanted toward a particular agenda. For example, in the discussion of tracking, Spring cites one study that found \\"few benefits\\" of tracking, but makes no mention of other studies that found benefits to students of various levels (Loveless, 1999; Epstein & MacIver, 1992). This is political correctness with a vengeance, and I would not rely on this biased and polemical book to become informed about the issues."},{"Title":"American Education -Tenth Edition","review":"I needed to get this textbook for a graduate level course on Social Issues in American Education. I think it is a wonderful introductory text to the history of education, as well as many of the schools and philosophies of thought that debate continually in American Education today. Many topics are covered that you hear about in the news and other media. Reviewing the facts on these issues (as Spring presents them terrifically) - will help you make your own decisions regarding these important issues. The text is very much a history text, and many of my colleagues had a difficulty reading through it. Many of them read the book like a textbook, and not as something that they could enjoy and actually get valuable information. Spring does a terrific job of displaying the facts of history and development of issues, and then explaining them to the fullest potential. I was fuzzy on a few educational issues, but Spring's clarity helped me understand them more completely. This book might also serve as a reference for one to go back to when an educational issue arises. Spring is continually amending the book through newer editions, so it is possible that one could use this book as a reference until the newer edition comes along. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher or thinking about going into the education profession - or anyone who is more interested in the American Schools. As a teacher, I found it very informative, and the history and statistics, overall interesting. If you aren't into the summary and digestion of statistics, this book might not be for you. I enjoyed it thoroughly however."},{"Title":"American Education -Tenth Edition","review":"I had to use it for a class.

Required reading for the school kids!92 year old,Dr. Mayberry, was a horticulture and agriculture professor at Tuskegee Univ. Mayberry was a student of George Washington Carver at Tuskegee, and Dr. Carver was a student of Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee. The book is about relationships but it has the great history angle to it.The book is an easy read. The book also speaks to how we treat the elderly and black &amp; white relations (Warren is white, Mayberry is black). Mayberry says-&quot;...the last 100 years were meant to be as they were. They were intended to educate us, for we would not be making the inroads that we are had it not been for our past mistakes. &quot;Every person lynched 100 years ago died so that we might learn. &quot;I must still speak for him or her. Questioning yesterday today for tomorrow's answers is important if we're to right what we got wrong in the twentieth century. They say we should not relive the past. I disagree. Reliving it in the right way and right time allows us to move from 'then was then' to 'now is now.' It is time to amend today to better understand our differences tomorrow. To not do so only ensures our repeating the worst of our history.

Dr. Mayberry's zeal for life (even at 92 years) and his passion for education are inspiring. What is truly remarkable is Dr. Mayberry's personal philosophy - which is quoted through out the book- I was especially moved by his &quot;peacemaker&quot; attitude. The relationship shared between Mayberry and Warren is a treasure beyond words, yet some how their special bond has been captured on the pages of this book.

The power is in the story of how a middle-aged white man, open to new relationships and seeking to learn from others, develops a deep affection and respect for a man many might see only as an aged black man. Through transparency, vulnerability, perseverance, and faithfulness to the relationship building process Mr. Warren reaps the benefits of the development of a very special new friend. Learning from Dr. Mayberry's wisdom, Warren discovers, unexpectedly, that he was racially prejudiced, and must confess to Mayberry and deal with that reality in his own heart and with Dr. Mayberry. It caused me to ask probing questions about my own prejudices, and not just racial ones.In spite of all the prejudice Dr. Mayberry has experienced in his lifetime, he remains an American optimist particularly concerning cross-cultural relationship and especially black-white relationships. That optimism is reflected in Dr. Mayberry's statement \\"this is a new day for America\\". Is it? At the micro level, I am well aware of black-white relationships that are deep and respectful. But is that true at a macro level? I would like to think that it is becoming truer. The reader is invited to ponder that and many other thought provoking ideas from the mind and life of Dr. Mayberry.Finally this book points, briefly, to the power of, and thus the need for, mentoring as we come to understand that Dr. Mayberry's mentor was George Washington Carver, and Dr. Carver's mentor was Booker T. Washington - great men passing their intellectual and humanitarian legacy onto the next generation. It begs the question for older men and women to ask: What is my legacy? Is it worth passing on? If it is, am I doing it?"},{"Title":"Where will we be when we get where we're going?: \\"Thursdays With Mayberry\\"","review":"Are you concerned about challenging yourself?Where Will We Be When We Get Where We're Going?: Thursdays with Mayberry by M.

This book is for the young and old alike; no matter what depth of color, or lack of color your skin may be.If anything, it will indeed self question your own thoughts and beliefs of human kind, your own culture, whatever race or ethnicity you may belong.

Dr. Mayberry is the wise professor, who has educated students in the academics and has shown them how to live productive lives by giving back. The author Mr. Warren has become the late in life student on how to live life. The story brings together history and relationships and how society has changed, in some ways positive, eg. civil rights movement, and other ways negative, the elderly in America and how we toss them aside.The history aspect of the book, Dr. Mayberry being the student of George Washington Carver, and George Washington Carver, the student of Booker T. Washington reflect one on one education with some of the greatest scientists produced in the US. These men were the backbone of the creation and future of Tuskegee University. They play an important role not only in Black history, but in science. (how likely is this style of education going to happen in American universities today)The relationships discussed in the book relate to everyone; young and old, red, yellow, black and white, male, female, etc. How am I relating to others and they to me?

While the discussion is illuminating and generally crisp and comprehensible, the over-use of the term &quot;public choice analyis&quot; proved annoying: Hardly a page went by without &quot;public choice analyis,&quot; sometimes twice in the same sentence.The general thrust of the text is that, however well-intentioned, no government can sustain a vibrant and diverse welfare-state over the long-term. Entrenched bureaucracies simply can't cope with the vagaries and varieties of human desires. Only the free market can hope to provide for the panoply of individuals' interests.Part I: A concise, lucid, introduction to the theory of public choice. Professor Tullock has a definitely &quot;small-government&quot; mentality (which I share), but his discussion is still even-handed. The sole problem I have is that the few tables and graphs he employs are completely unitelligible to me. Fortunately, they're not essential, as his writing should be clear enough. The most important topics are rent-seeking and log-rolling, the former of which is the topic most treated by the co-authors. Also of interest is the discussion about bureaucracies.Part II: A far ranging, perhaps wandering, discussion of the application of rent-seeking to American regulatory policy. Brady writes with a slightly more fervent tone than does Tullock, with a clear but tempered opinion of the roles lawyers, regulators, etc. Generally interesting, but the chapters somewhat lack coherence with each other beyond the theory.Part III: Sheldon here presents the most entertaining and forcefully written section of the book. Full of vigor, he brings ip several issues that are of critical interest to proponents of small government: the Fabian fallacy, the growth of addiction to the welfare-state, and the welfare-state's role in the collapse of the family.A great introduction for the interested student of politics or economics."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"Collaboratively written by American economists Gordon Tullock, Gordon Brady, and British economist Arthur Seldon, Government Failure: A Primer In Public Choice is a cold, unforgiving look at governmental economic policies, ranging from how American special interest groups lobby reap enormous and destructive favors, to the manifold disasters that have come from British governmental interventions in the economy. A caution about he concentration of power promoted by the European Union rounds out this stark, scholarly, and persuasive treatise. Also available in hardcover (193086521X..,), Government Failure is strongly recommended reading for students of Economics and Political Science."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"I'm entirely sympathetic to the ideas of Public Choice Theory from my other reading.However, I did not find these ideas to be well presented in this book.The first problem is the different styles of the 3 authors:Tullock has a sketchy meandering style. This is not a comprehensive overview. He digresses into apologetics for how preliminary many of his conclusions are. His presentation of crucial concepts is not as clear or as compelling as it deserves to be. He fails to address many obvious counter arguments.Brady has the opposite problem from sketchy: He spends far more time than necessary in his chapter on internet regulation in presenting the technical weeds of internet history.Seldon is the best writer of the three, presenting well structured and engaging ideas. Some of his non-essential historical comments (Lincoln) are wrong headed as other reviewers have observed.Since one on the Chapters is titled Bureaucracy, I was stunned that no reference is made to von Mises' legendary \\"Bureaucracy\\" (1944). I took the opportunity to finally read it (free at the mises.org site).Wow! what a difference! Mises is compelling, comprehensive, cogent, well structured, erudite and convincing. His historical references span all cultures and eras. In one paragraph he demolishes Keynesian bureaucracy more brilliantly than I've seen anywhere. Hat's off to Mises. Shame on these 3 for ignoring him."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"Bought this for class. It worked well. It is well-written in an easy manner. Glad to have bought this product and recommend this. @eplusq"},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"I agree with many libertarian ideas but this book is not very good. Poorly written, narrow in perspective, and without much traction in the field--this book is not worth the time. Read Thomas Sowell instead."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"This is a great book to get the reader started into the Public Choice branch of economics and politics. It is a must read for people looking to jump into the much more complicated books on public choice."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"The other reviewers have provided well-stated synopses of the arguments so I will skip to my opinion of the book.\\"Government Failure\\" is a quick dip into political theory. It presents a particular school of thought and how that school would (should) perceive the current state of government. One can read the book in an afternoon and feel as though one has learned something. What it lacks, however, is a compelling argument that would convince anyone reading the theory with a critical eye.One of the first problems is that even Mr. Tullock, a founder of the theory, does not actually like the term \\"public choice\\". Mr. Seldon also questions the appropriateness of the term. Coining a term, using it in a book title, then undermining its applicability in that same book casts some doubt on how thoroughly they have thought through this.A second problem is that most claims made are unsubstantiated. What the reader is getting is logic that interpolates personal opinion and presents it as a truth. It is a perfectly acceptable approach when one considers this a philosophical tract, but not an acceptable approach if the intent is to \\"tell it like it is\\".A third, more egregious problem, is the looseness of the the term \\"self interest\\". I would argue that, much like the demand curve, the meaning and degree of self interest a person demonstrates is not constant, but subject to external influencers or moods. Thus it is not necessarily a contradiction to expect an elected official to behave in a manner that has nothing to do with his/her interest in getting re-elected. This does not mean they don't care; it just means that it is not a factor in the decision.Alas, this brief treatise does not do a credible job of defining terms. It does a somewhat better job with \\"log rolling\\" but chooses to define \\"rent seeking\\" using the words \\"rent\\" and \\"seek\\" in its definition. The rent-seeking examples provided were also less illuminating. One that stands out has to do with the mortgage deduction on the income tax. I believe Tullock is arguing that by making homeownership look attractive it ends up costing people more to move from one domicle to another than it would if they just stayed in apartments. But he doesn't explicitly state that, or even connect the dots for you.Moreover, to use the loosely defined \\"self-interet\\" argument, it is reasonable to think that several factors come into play when a person chooses to buy a residence versus renting. People are very good at rationalizing decisions that on paper do not appear to be the most economically efficient. Why? Because the bottom line is not always the driver of human decisions.Finally, question the critical praise on the back of the cover. One professor is quoted as saying \\"The scope of government control and activity has burgeoned far beyond the conception of the founders of the American republic.\\" Consider the government's mission (aka the Preamble to the Consitution): form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. These are very broad statements indeed; it seems reasonable to argue that several interpretations were possible at the time they were made, just as several are possible now.This book is a somewhat useful introduction to a theory that doesn't seem to have a good name. It is a good book for information gathering but not particularly enlightening."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"Not terribly useful, though a good introductory review of log-rolling and rent-seeking. Might perhaps do as a book for an introductory Political Science course if backed up with significant amounts of other material."},{"Title":"Government Failure: A Primer in Public Choice","review":"Arthur Seldon uses Abraham Lincoln as an example of a leader who believed in limited government, &quot;of the people, by the people, and for the people&quot;. In actuality, Lincoln lead a failed government attempt at state railroad building when he was in the Illinois legislature. He instituted the first conscription in the United States, and the first income tax. He lead the charge of an unconstitutional export tax on Southern cotton and then an actual blockade. He intimidated the Supreme Court and executed Union soldiers for sleeping on duty. Seldon should do a bit of reading about Lincoln before he uses him as an icon for small government. I, personally, was so turned off by the introduction that I couldn't bring myself to read the book."},{"Title":"The Complete Beatles Gift Pack","review":"Virtually every Beatles song ever recorded appears in this two-volume set. It includes even some of the Beatles cover songs such as \\"Kansas City\\" and \\"A Taste of Honey\\".What you get are the standard sheet music versions of these songs, nicely printed and easy to read. The book is at an intermediate level. Typical Hal Leonard scores: a base line in the spirit of the recording, chords voiced in the center and melody on top. Not always very pianistic, but the songs are transcribed pretty well harmonically. Also tab is included and of course lyrics. Some of the songs include the Beatles solo, fills or intros. For instance the instrumetal part of Polythene Pam, Savoy Truffle or Yer Blues. All the songs I've played so far except \\"Penny Lane\\" are in the key they were recorded in. It seems \\"Penny Lane\\" is in B, the music is in C.If you want to know every note the Beatles played, get the \\"The Beatles Complete Scores\\" also sold by Amazon.com. However, to me its hard to read and not really playable. So if you just want to just get in and play, this is preferable.It's quite a luxury to have not just thier hits but all their music together. After playing something like \\"Let it Be\\" you can just turn a few pages and delve into something you'd never expect to play like \\"Piggies\\", \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" or virtually play through all of \\"Abbey Road\\". While the Beatles aren't Gods to me, it really hits you how talented these guys were when you've got it all in front of you like this."},{"Title":"The Complete Beatles Gift Pack","review":"While, it's fun to see ALL of the Beatles tunes in one book, this book was clearly not compiled by a guitarist. In many places the guitar voicing is spectacularly wrong, and is recorded in ways in which a guitarist would never play something. The author clearly had no concept of walkups and walkdowns around chords, a technique used by many composing guitarists. For example, \\"Dear Prudence,\\" \\"While my guitar gently weeps,\\" \\"Blackbird\\" and even easy ones like \\"Mother Nature's Child\\" are butchered in terms of tabbing. \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" are particularly offensive--the chord voicings in the book only bear a passing resemblance to those actually played by the Beatles. How can one mess up \\"Dear Prudence?\\" The verse bass walkdown over D is classic, and is the same as Neil Young's \\"Needle and the Damage Done.\\" D-C-B-Bb, 2 beats each. The chorus and bridge are botched as well. Same thing with the \\"Weeps\\" verse over Am: A-G-F#-F. This is straightforward stuff if the author knew anything about guitar playing, but is completely botched in this book.So in summary this book may work as a \\"family singalong around the piano\\" book, but it's going to fail a guitarist who wants to explore how the greatest rock songwriters in history practiced their craft. If you're looking at this for the guitar tab, look elsewhere! I did much better messing around myself or looking for tabs on the internet."},{"Title":"The Complete Beatles Gift Pack","review":"While I have read and don't discount the caveats from the guitar players and the extreme completists, for casual piano players like me who grew up with the Beatles this is everything you could want. Every song the Beatles sang, including covers.While others have complained that the arrangements are too easy, they aren't dumbed down into the easiest keys to play as in some collections. They sound like the original keys -- a lot are in E major or c# minor (four sharps). The two volume split makes them a workable size to stay open on your piano. So far, no problems with the bindings.I received this as a Christmas present and it is one of the best I've gotten in a long time. Just reading through the 200+ songs brings back so many great memories. A must for anyone who listened to music in the '60s.. . .

Don't waste your time with the horrid (in my opinion) re-written, condensed versions that came out later. This was actually written by a man from what I have read! The original author of the series, Mildred Wirt Benson, was not asked to write this one. I read in the terrific book &quot;Rediscovering Nancy Drew&quot; by Carolyn Stewart Dyer that Benson and the Stratemyer Syndicate (who published the Nancy Drew series) had many conflicts over Nancy's character and how she should write the series instead of just letting her author the books. Mildred Wirt Benson later returned to write the 11th book of the series and resumed until #25, and then her last one for the series was #30. Stratemeyer also argued with man who wrote this mystery for the series in Benson's absence. I believe #8,9,10 were all written by the same male writer who also wrote screenplays for movies. This is an excellent story, and I heartily enjoy all of the original versions. They are far superior to the low-rent rewritten versions. Even as a child reading the series 20 years ago I enjoyed the orginal 30's versions of the series over the faster-paced but trashy re-written versions.

I gave her volumes 1 through 6 for her birthday, and her mom tells me that she is just blazing through each book, because she loves them so much.It warmed my heart to give her these books, as I remember reading them when I was her age. I used to borrow one book a week from the local public library in the 1970s. Nancy Drew was always a great read.I think that we establish a great connection with our children when we share with them something that we also loved as kids. It's a joy for all involved.In my opinion, you can't go wrong. These books are classics, and by encouraging young ones to read them, you help the children in your life to foster a great habit of reading--one that remains with them through their entire life. I think books of this nature also help to make them better critical thinkers and better writers."},{"Title":"Nancy's Mysterious Letter (Nancy Drew, Book 8)","review":"In \\"Nancy's Mysterious Letter\\", Nancy receives a letter from London. Not just any letter though, it tells of her inheritance of a small fortune. Unfortunately, the inheritance is for a different Nancy Drew. But before all this, Nancy invites her elderly mail carrier, Ira Nixon, in the house for some hot chocolate because it was winter and very cold. When Ira has bid Nancy farewell and is about to leave, he discovers his mailbag has bean stolen! Then later on, Nancy discovers the thief who stole Ira's mailbag is planning to marry the other Nancy Drew for her fortune. Meanwhile, nobody told the other Nancy Drew about her inheritance! Nancy's out on a mystery to discover who stole the mail, and who the real heiress to the fortune awaiting in London is.Overall, it was ok. Maybe if it had more suspense and action, I prefer those kinds of books. I'm not sure if this was just a dud, or if all the Nancy Drew books are like this because this is the first one I've read. The thing that bugs me is that everything works out so perfectly through the story, so it gets boring, and there's no surprise in the ending. Just because I don't care for it though, don't you not read it. If you like innocent mysteries and old-fashioned stories, you'll probably love this. *_~"},{"Title":"Nancy's Mysterious Letter (Nancy Drew, Book 8)","review":"This book is great!

Nancy mistakenly receives a letter intended for another Nancy Drew, informing her that she has inherited a large sum of money. Also, when Nancy invites her elderly mailman in for a drink of cocoa, his mailbag is stolen from Nancy's porch. Nancy sets out to find the other Nancy Drew and to locate the person who took the mailbag so that she can restore the tarnished reputation of her mailman. Personally, I found this book to be very boring. The mystery is not exciting and there is very little action in the book. Nancy solves the mystery in the end, but it is not through brilliant detective work, it is because she attends a football game at Emerson University. I know that chance encounters always play a big part in solving the case in Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries, but this was just pure dumb luck and nothing else. I wouldn't even waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"How to Pick Up Girls!","review":"This is a nicely readable common-sense guide. I read the original version years ago, before we had online avenues like chat rooms and email. No, the book isn't some magic pill designed to turn you into a suave seducer. Intead, its a practical guide that can give you the confidence to step forward more effectively. The advice includes moving with confidence, being nice, and never letting rejection throw you. In short, the book asks you to shed your shyness and self-defeating insecurities (which many gals also have) because you view yourself as less than ideal. Hey, who is?

Turner, his life and work: A critical biography","review":"Lindsay in his introduction criticizes previous biographers of Turner and says their work is 'unfortunate'. Lindsay attempts to make amends for them but does not fully do it. He does provide a sense of what Turner believed his life and work to be about. He does outline the path of Turner's career, and chronicle his great success. Turner is perhaps the greatest of all landscape papers. His sense of color and light are unequalled. This book does not do his work justice, and the illustrations and photographs do not give a real idea of the range and greatness of Turner's work.

Why they have never done this one is a puzzle. Eliot's description of English pastoral life in 1799 leaves no stone unturned. The characters are as sharply drawn as if you had met them a few moments ago. You can literally smell the fresh country air. Yes, the character of Dinah is overdone, reminding one of Dicken's saccharine women, but a small price to pay in so rewarding a book. You will be truly sorry when you finish to leave the world Eliot has drawn so well. The morals of these people are no longer ours, and that must be kept in mind always. But Eliot has stated that the idea for this book came from a story of her aunt's, who did indeed go to such a woman as Hetty in prison. And there is a wealth of criticism on &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, including Virginia Woolf's &quot;Second Common Reader&quot;. A rave!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"A book full of wonderful unforgettable characters. Adam Bede and his brother, the preistess who falls in love with Adam, and the precious innocent who impregnants herself then searches for her &quot;husband&quot; while engaged ton Adam. I love the twists and turns, my favorite George Eliot novel."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"George Eliot weaves a simple story of love, suffering, and goodness. While the plot is hardly complex (boy loves girl, another boy gets girl, unhappiness abounds - also reused in Mill on the Floss), the manner in which Eliot develops her characters and their emotions and actions ring as true and resoundingly as a bell. It's so clear, so obvious, but also moving and textured. You feel Adam's absolute love for vain little Hetty, Dinah's calming grace, Arthur's good intentions, Lisbeth's fretting nature. Eliot draws you in with her honest observations of life in a country town, without the background becoming a dominant factor. The near idyllic life the characters lead is a healthy contrast to the town's emotional upheaval.Adam is an upright, genuine character, and not as perfect as he seems. If his love for Hetty seems unfounded at times, it only serves to highlight how dangerous delusions can be. All the \\"sinners\\" are ultimately redeemed by truth - true love, true friends, true promises, and true acceptance. Religion plays a significant part in the novel, but don't let that deter you. It's so much more than that - Adam Bede is truly one of the few works that encompass a world of humanity between two covers.AB reminded me of Tess of the D'Ubervilles a bit, but there is no villain here, just flawed, honest people in search of unattainable dreams. In the process of trying to get a bit of happiness, they stumble and bleed, but ultimately find something truly worth having. Bittersweetness is Eliot's trademark for good reason.George Eliot's first full novel is obviously a bit less polished than her later works, but you see the wonderful command she has over language and expression. The book, the people, the story all come alive with her touch. A rare read that has something to say and says it beautifully."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Such strength in characters, a variety served on a platter. George Eliot was truely a gifted writer, a writer with style and flair."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"What can I say about this wondeful story? The genius George Eliot lulls us into a false sense of security - the first half of the book is so idyllic and lovely that we are just not prepared for the ensuing tragedy. Marvellous."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I found Middlemarch just too long to plod through, but thoroughly enjoyed and actually had fun reading Adam Bede.What other style of romance is more romantic than a man and a woman who have feelings for each other but don't expose them, dawdling around pretending not to have feelings for each other?This is a superb work by my favorite author."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Adam Bede is the perfect pastoral, combining qualities of the Golden Age with the eye of an occupant of the Iron Age. This novel has wonderful religious allusions, making it a second tale of Eden's jests. Over all, a wonderful moral pastoral which places an emphasis on the need of human compassion. A great summer read."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"\\"Adam Bede\\" is a bucolic novel, and in its attempt to capture daily life in a small, rustic town in England (circa 1800) it succeeds remarkably well. Unfortunately, its this leisurely portrait of the town and its denizens that made reading the first 300-plus pages something of a chore. My two greatest problems with the story were its lack of plot until that point, and near lack of interesting characters. Adam and Seth are dull, hardworking, self-sacrificing, and would give Jesus a run for his money in terms of saintliness (significantly, they're carpenters). The book spends a great deal of time visiting the different homes in the town, and creating realistic depictions of the people who live and work there. Most are almost as dull as Adam. Hetty Sorrell is the only truly interesting character in the book (although the author continually berates her with moralistic reproaches). Arthur Donnithorne has some interesting moments as well, but he ultimately (and unconvincingly) proves spineless -- sacrificing his own happiness to comply with societal opinion (and to redeem himself in Adam's eyes). Once Hetty's story kicked into gear, the book became increasingly interesting -- culminating in her desperate trek across a larger world she'd never dreamed existed. As someone else noted, Hetty's character bears some resemblance to Mdme Bovary ... and to Hedda Gabler, Scarlet O'Hara, Hester Prynne (after whom she is named), and many other great female literary characters. And, for all its upright characters (and moralizing narrator), the real heart of the book is Hetty's tragic fate. A 17-year old girl, she is essentially a victim of statutory rape (at least by today's standards) who finds herself shunned by family and society when she scandously becomes pregnant. Her unintentional infanticide, and subsequent trial and demise provide a far more telling commentary on the mores of Georgian England than they do on Hetty Sorrell. I suspect that Eliot, to her credit, may be more on Hetty's side than she lets on."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"As the title indicates, I feel quite unqualified to review the writings of George Eliot. But I did like the edition that Penguin classics puts out. It's sturdy, held up well being hauled around (never go anywhere without a book). I thought the explanatory notes at the end were quite thorough, and I enjoyed the editor's introduction."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"You HAVE to read this book, it's a winner for all Victorian literature mavens."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Compared to Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss, Adam Bede is a dull read. Sure it has all the richness of George Eliot novels, but the story seems a bit contrived and the ending isn't very satisfactory."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Adam Bede is my second favourite book by George Elliot. This is a wonderful story about a young dairymaid who is seduced by a country squire - an old story it's true, but George Eliot handles this in her own unique way. No one can create a sense of scene and paint imagery with words like she can. The story is sad in its honesty, but it does not leave one with the feeling of partaking of a tragedy. Perhaps it is the sense of hopefulness that brims through the pages. This novel is one of George Eliot's earlier works, and her character development and writing skills do get better with later works, but her wonderful skill is still very apparent in this book. The women characters in this book seem to be the stronger, but Adam Bede himself is a wonder. Ms. Eliot was a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"\\"Adam Bede\\" is a story about love, self-deception, religious feeling, innocence, and experience. It would not be an unfit introduction to Eliot, though \\"Middlemarch\\" is by far her superior novel.I am awed by Eliot's psychological insight into human personality. Her characters are some of the most vivid in all of literary history, and her ability to penetrate to the very heart of human motivation is unrivaled. She presents her story with wit and subtle sarcasm. (Take, for instance, this tongue-in-cheek comment, which will explain Adam's devotion to Hetty: \\"Of course, I know that, as a rule, sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance, see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty, never imagine themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on all proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in every respect. . . . But even to this rule an exception will occur now and then in the lapse of centuries, and my friend Adam was one.\\")Eliot's command of English is deeply impressive, and this book is worth reading just for the beauty of the language. But the story is quite interesting as well, and you will come to care about and sympathize with the characters. It is not a fast paced book, and it will require an investment of time and intellect. But it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"When George Eliot published her first novel ADAM BEDE in 1859, unknown to her reading public, she had just ushered in a new era of the English novel. Beginning with this novel, Eliot infused her novels with an overwhelming sense of determinism, a then popular philosophy that suggested that man's voyage through life, that when set by nature, society, or even by himself, was etched in stone. If literary characters were to pursue a course of action that was taken willingly, then that character had to live with the consequences, however unpleasant. The primary characters of the book, Adam himself, Arthur Donnithorne, and Hetty Sorrel, are seen as limited in their ability to avoid the ramifications of their actions.Adam Bede is portrayed as the quintessential man of good. Indeed one of the problems that modern readers have with him is that in his goodness, he is essentially a flat character, whose goodness towards others and anger towards Donnithorne, all stem from that same well of virtue. Adam falls in love with the flighty and flirty Hetty Sorrel, and is prepared to marry her, until he catches her passionately embracing his childhood friend, the aristocratic Donnithorne. The two men fight, the consequences of which set in motion a sequence of events that do not allow for mitigation of circumstance. In Hetty Sorrel, Eliot has created a woman whom she seems to judge overly harshly. Hetty truly is a flirt, and a passionate one at that, but to subject her to a non-stop series of painful retributions merely because of Hetty's willingness to sleep with the object of her youthful dreams, Donnithorne, suggests that Eliot began the book with a deck stacked partially against Adam but totally against her. And then there is Donnithorne, one who is supposed to be the villain, yet he is far less the villain as Eliot tries mightily to portray him just as Adam is far less the understanding hero as Eliot tries just as mightily to depict him. As Adam and Donnithorne battle each other for possession of the fickle Hetty, the lovely preacher Dinah Morris has been patiently waiting for Adam to come to his senses and forget his infatuation with Hetty and recognize the virtuous treasure that Eliot wants the reader to see.Readers today show a marked lack of patience with Eliot's frequent narrative intrusions. Editors call such intrusions the use of omniscient narrator, a style of writing popular in Eliot's day but pass&eacute; today. Yet, there are many readers who enjoy the panoramic vistas and linguistic idiosyncrasies that Eliot draws of a countryside that even in her day was fixed in the roots of an earlier 18th century cultural milieu. For those who do not mind Eliot's sometimes all too frequent helpful and sometimes unwanted comments, ADAM BEDE can be a welcome read in that it is a living reminder of how people may not escape the consequences of their actions, no matter how hard they try."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Like other reviewers, I have read other Eliot books and enjoyed them. In ADAM BEDE, there are a lot of wonderful glimpses into country life, and several memorable characters, especially some of the \\"B list\\" folks such as Mrs. Poyser and Bartle Massey. And as someone pointed out, for a student of religious history it gives a good inside view on the conflict between the Established church and the growing evangelical movement of the Wesleys. But I think the book has two huge flaws. First, am I the only person who found Hetty's pregnancy to be a complete blindsiding plot device with virtually no preparation? Can we believe that a girl who lives with farm workers could conceal a pregnancy that must have been advanced enough for her to deliver an infant viable enough to remain alive for many hours after birth? Sure, Eliot comments a few times about her \\"roundness,\\" but in Victorian lit that could easily be a comment on other portions of her anatomy. There is nothing in her relationship to Arthur that suggests further intimacy than kisses in the woods. I felt betrayed when the pregnancy/infanticide became the main hinge of the plot, since it was so poorly set up. And once Hetty's trial is over, the rest of the book just dribbles out to the conclusion. Eliot didn't seem to realize that once she tied that plot up, her book should have ended quickly. So, three stars for wonderful scenery, dialog, and character...but points off for plot!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"My high school English teacher, a nun, assigned this book in my junior year. I think I considered it a great accomplishment to make it through the entire book and the fact that I actually enjoyed the experience was a bonus. At seventeen, I didn't have the experience in life to really appreciate this book fully. So at 65, I decided to re-read it. First, I was amazed that I actually read this without complaining at seventeen because it can be very tedious reading at times. I have been spoiled over the years with the short concise sentences which are the order of the day in the 21st century. If one considers the long sentences, the difficult dialect, and the complicated thoughts, Eliot often rivals our modern-day government with her over-blown verbiage. I would come to the end of a sentence and want to say, \\"Come again?\\"However, Adam Bede is an unusual and beautiful story with well-drawn characters and a realistic picture of 19th-century rural English life. To give you an idea of the personalities of the two main female characters, I'll take you to the more well-known story Gone With the Wind. Who can forget vain Scarlett and saintly Melanie? Well, Eliot's Hetty would be compatible with Scarlett and Eliot's Dinah would make an excellent friend for Melanie.I loved Eliot's admiration for the simple folks--the hardworking country folks. I liked the way she philosophized about art and how the homely pictures with the simple household objects and the homely wrinkled people shouldn't be scorned.This story is very heavy on characterization and description for more than half of the book and then during the second half we learn about the true reason for the book--the events which lead to tragedies and change the lives of some of the characters irrevocably. Then your heart will start to beat faster and you won't be able to put the book down. But actually even before then I started looking forward to getting back to the book each evening, and I think it was because I was falling in love with some of the characters. Eliot is superb at drawing her characters and breathing life into them.I was satisfied with the conclusion and very moved with many of the scenes. Some of the characters simply shine with the goodness, love, and forgiveness they display. They could put us all to shame! And then again some of the characters are very human and their complaining natures are always very evident. There is a good mix here. You won't conclude that all of these people are just too good but you won't be overwhelmed by evil because even when evil rears its ugly head, Eliot shows us in her compassionate way that evil is sometimes the result of a human being in desperate circumstances. Great story!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Having read George Eliot's great work 25 years ago and forgotten why I'd liked it so much, I recently re-read ADAM BEDE and liked it just as much again. Perhaps it is an unsung masterpiece, because I have never heard much tell of it. Nevertheless, it's a book that sums up a lot of what is great about literature in general, and about 19th century English literature in particular. Eliot evokes the English countryside in all its varied moods throughout the seasons. She presents rural life as if her book were an anthropological case study (only much better written than most). Her saga of a desperate voyage throughout England by an increasingly-penniless girl brings the feel of the country in the early 19th century very close. The slowly-unfolding story will engross any reader who has a feel for the slower paced books of that time. Dinah Morris as itinerant Methodist preacher was an unusual character then and perhaps now too. Bound up in her puritanical cause---to bring the word of God to the masses of \`sinners'---she cannot envision married life, certainly not with Seth Bede, who is deeply in love with her. Adam Bede, a tall, intelligent carpenter with something of a temper, loves the shallow, self-absorbed Hetty Sorrel, a maid in the home of her uncle and aunt, the Poysers, tenants in good standing on the local estate. Both Adam and Seth have to deal with their recently-bereaved mother, a complainer, who nevertheless loves her boys. Adam sets great store by two friendships--with Rev. Irwine, the local Anglican minister, and with Arthur Donnithorne, the son of the landowner. He also has a great admirer in the shape of Bartle Massey, a teacher of local adults who finds Adam to be the great success of his life. Arthur, Adam's friend, conducts a casual affair with Hetty, who dreams of a life of riches and ease, but things turn out differently. Things go very bad, but end more felicitously than might be expected. All these characters are very well-developed and a pleasure to follow. Arthur, though he seduces Hetty, is a complex character in fact, with many good points to offset his callous treatment of the not-so-innocent Hetty. Eliot handles the varied shades of each character very well.Sex is only hinted at, little violence, more than a bit of religion and moral guidance to readers thrown in. Some people may find the use of 19th century rural English dialects rather hard to follow. You can get used to it. The beauty of the prose and the sincerity of the story carry everything before them. If you love literature, you must read this novel."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans, 1819-1880) has gained the reputation as being one of the finest writers of 19th century England. She is considered to be an equal of Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters, or any other writer of her era. Middlemarch is her masterpiece. The present novel was her first major work.Many of her works have rural settings, involve moral values, and feature realistic plots and characters. Eliot was an agnostic but tied to Christian moral values which are an integral part of her stories. Her characters and plots are easier to believe than Dickens, who for example, introduced highly improbable reunions and lost relatives to get closure for his plot in Oliver Twist. And, the characters of George Eliot are more human and realistic than those found in the novels of Jane Austen or those in Charlotte Bronte's highly entertaining Jane Eyre. Also, she has much detail in her minor characters. Unlike Austen, the prose and the relations among characters are straightforward, and one does not have to make a family tree to understand all the characters, nor is there a learning period of 25 to 50 pages needed to understand the prose - as in Austen's Mansfield Park.While her masterpiece is acknowledged to be Middlemarch, many consider her first novel Adam Bede to be an entertaining read. It features Eliot's style and techniques. As described in the introduction, Eliot is the \\"omniscient narrator...controlling reaction and interpretation with her own illuminating intelligence.\\"The story is a love triangle between two men and a teenage woman, the young, beautiful, naive, and self absorbed Hetty Sorrel. She is very young, approximately 17, obsessed with her beauty, and works at a farm which produces cheese. Adam Bede is one of the men interested in Hetty. He is a carpenter in his twenties. Arthur Donnithorne, the rich young squire and friend of Adam, is the other man interested in Hetty. There is a second female protagonist, Dinah Morris, who is also relatively young and who is a Methodist preacher.Without giving away the plot, the heart of the story is the self delusion or self-deception of Hetty and the other primary characters. They are living in a rural farming community somewhere in north central England. Will Hetty accept the carpenter Adam Bede or do something crazy and run off or have an affair with Arthur? That is the main element of the plot.The story is not exactly a page turner but it is good. In any case, it is an excellent read.Recommend: 5 stars."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"This book is a good read although it can be slow at times. Adam Bede is, of course, the title character. But it is Hetty Sorrel that Eliot uses to raise questions about a very judgmental society. Hetty's &quot;fall&quot; asks the question of who is to blame. Throughout the novel she is never given much guidance, although she is expected to act in the proper manner. In fact, Eliot may not have even known how to deal with society's reaction to Hetty, therefore, making a dull ending that does not make much sense. Eliot seems afraid to address the issues of Hetty being integrated back into society and the consequences of her actions. In failing to end the book with Hetty coming back home, Eliot fails to make her point. That being, the influence of a society in the actions of their people. Who is to blame? Eliot herself, in the weak ending, backs down to the very own society she is questioning. Hetty is not allowed to return, therefore, the society is never forced to deal with the issue. In the end, Eliot raises many questions regarding the structure of society. However, she does not follow through and falls short in the ending. All in all, I would highly recommend this read. If you can get through the slow spots, you will raise many of your own questions about who is responsible when someone falls short in our own society? Good Luck and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I just finished reading this book for my Victorian Lit class,and I am incredibly inpressed with it. In the book, GeorgeEliot tells about the lives of the residence of Hayslope, afarming community around 1800. The book has a riveting plotthat includes romance, betrayal, and murder. Moreimportantly, however, the book has a strong moral; it is sureto leave an impression in the mind of even the most cynicalreader. Eliot, herself, summed the book up best in asking,&quot;Shall I ever write another book as true as 'Adam Bede'?&quot;"},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego. Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I am still in the middle of reading Adam Bede. So far, it is a very interestin' book by George Eliot; not her best; it it her first novel; but interestin', just the same. Thee likes 'he book."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"This book was a dirty task to complete, but I was so enchanted with the romances that I couldn't put this book down. Not only of romance (Eliot's forte), but with tragic twists. Superb, and also difficult read. Readers of all ages will find this story beautiful and hard to forget."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I loved this book and could not put it down. Eliot does a wonderful job describing her characters. Their strong points become their downfalls in the end and only when they overcome their weaknesses do they succeed. For example, Hetty is the beautiful dairy maid. Her mannerisms are charming and complement her great beauty. Her beauty becomes her downfall because of the attention she receives from the local squire. The consequences of her behavior are not retractable and affect her and her family deeply. Hetty is just one of the many interesting women that Eliot portrays. Even though the title is &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, Eliot manages to interlace important female characters throughtout the book."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Anybody who had fallen deeply in love would be touched by the character of Adam Bede. George Eliot's fecund words are reminiscence of a first kiss .... unforgettable."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"George Eliot definitely had fine insight into human nature. As a lover of Victorian British literature, this book is a very pleasant read. You'll be shocked by the actions of some of the characters, but pleased with the outcome of the novel."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Adam Bede, the main man who as it may seem be to good to be true. However, he does have his flaws. Adam is the first of four major charater each whith a flaw that makes them interlink in more than just one way. This is a good story of good work pays off and takes a nasty shot at the social order."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Adam Bede, the titular hero of George Eliot's first novel, is of a character so sterling that one little anecdote serves to define his whole life and work ethic: He's a carpenter, and he had done some work for a lady whose father, an old squire named Donnithorne, suggested that she pay him less than the fee he requested. Adam insisted that he would rather take no money for the job, for to accept a reduced amount would be like admitting he overcharges for shoddy work. By standing on his principles, he won his full fee in the end and cemented his reputation as a businessman of honor and acumen, proving his fairness to both his customers and himself.Thus he seems an unlikely match for Hetty Sorrel, the prettiest girl in the village of Hayslope. Vain, selfish, materialistic, hating her laborious farm chores, Hetty bears more than a passing resemblance to Flaubert's Madame Bovary. However, while Madame Bovary's unattainable dream world is inspired by her reading romances, Hetty &quot;had never read a novel&quot; so she can't &quot;find a shape for her expectations&quot; regarding love. Unable to foresee any possible consequences for her actions, she allows herself to be seduced by Arthur Donnithorne, the old squire's grandson, who stands to inherit the land on which most of the Hayslopers live.Arthur is a radiant example of Eliot's mastery in complicated character creation. Acutely aware of his position in society, he has the kind of charisma with which he can talk to his tenants politely but with just the slightest hint of condescension and completely win their respect for his authority. In fact, he is so accustomed to receiving nothing but admiration for his apparent moral integrity that it comes as a genuine shock to him when Adam, a man he truly likes, reproaches him for his reckless behavior with Hetty, a girl both he and Adam truly love. And the tragic irony is that Hetty doesn't really deserve either of them.Religion plays a curious role in the story. Adam's brother Seth is infatuated with a woman named Dinah Morris, a cousin's cousin to Hetty and a Methodist evangelistic preacher who was inspired by Wesley in the flesh. Her influence among the villagers comes to the attention of the Anglican Rev. Dauphin Irwine, the vicar of Hayslope, who visits her to try to figure out her game and concludes that she's essentially a good woman with a good heart. Indeed, she is the first one to sense that Hetty may be headed for troubled waters and earnestly offers her spiritual guidance, to which Hetty responds with distrust and irritation.Most powerful of the novel's images is that of Hetty wandering through the darkness and dangers of the English countryside in desperate search of the departed Arthur, carrying with her a symbol of their tormented love, and oblivious to the goodness of Adam, whose only desire is to protect her from the disappointment, shame, and disgrace that result from her pitiful reliance on Arthur's ability to buy her pretty things. But Eliot is too fond of her hero to let him suffer for long when the tides of fate come crashing violently to their inevitable shores, and the ultimate product is a novel of great compassion for its characters."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"Highly recommended for those who loves classic literature. George Elliot beautifully captured the lives of the people in rural English country in the late 18th century and early 19th century. I guarantee you'll fall in love with all the 4 main characters ie. Adam Bede, Hetty Sorrel, Lord Arthur and Dinah Morris before you finish the book. The courting scenes involving Adam Bede and Dinah are both very romantic and honest. George Elliot had a great understanding of human nature which makes the story very believable although it's fiction. ADAM BEDE's a hero in my heart, and this book's a must read for all literature fans."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I just finished &quot;Adam Bede,&quot; turning to the novels of George Eliot after a long stint of reading only Thomas Hardy. A long-time fan of Hardy's work, I thought him to be my favorite English author -- George Eliot, however, has proven to be quite the challenger to Hardy for a place in my heart.&quot;Adam Bede&quot; is the tale of simple people making their way in the world, each of them encountering hardship and sorrow along the way. Eliot's style is immediately engaging: she addresses the reader directly, and it seems like she is behind the scenes everywhere, pulling up a curtain to reveal vignettes in the lives of her characters. She forces the readers, almost, to fall in love with Adam immediately -- the strong, righteous man whom the story will carry along its rocky path. Similarly, Dinah emerges immediately as the source of peace and goodness in the novel, and it is always refreshing when, in times of turmoil, she appears.I was bothered by only one element of the story, but I think it is rather easily overlooked: Adam's unrelenting love for Hetty. Eliot gives little background as to why his feelings for her are so strong, and all we really know of her personality is that she is incredibly vain because she is incredibly beautiful. Adam never struck me as a character who would fall for such a &quot;surface&quot; woman. His final choice for a wife (which I will not reveal in case amazon.com surfers haven't read the book yet) seems much more appropriate.All in all, the journey through this book is a most rewarding one. I look forward to my next Eliot read!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"ADAM BEDE is a thrilling read, though it may seem hard to believe given the unpromising setting and the stilted way Eliot introduces her story. But after the first few starchy chapters, abruptly, something wonderful happens: she gets wise to herself. It's as if you can see her realize that the upright characters she *thought* she was pinning her story on, dull Dinah and Mr Irwine, aren't really the stuff of which fiction is made -- so she shoves them aside and takes up the flawed characters of her triangle, who resonate with possibility at every turn. Suddenly, miraculously, with almost no warning, all Eliot's amazing gifts as a writer take center stage: Her psychological insight. Her phenomenal wit. The dramatizing genius that allows her, effortlessly, to plot the most intimate narrative developments against the gigantic backdrop of a county-wide feast or funeral. Her fearlessness and surefootedness in picking her way (and ours) through the tangle of social and class relationships of an entire village. In this embarrassment of riches, maybe most rewarding for a reader like me is Eliot's unerring ability to pay off her plots: here, ladies and gentlemen, is a writer who knows how to write the hell out of a climax -- George Eliot's big confrontation scenes never, ever disappoint.Too, some wizardry seems to keep her narrative touch both incomparably delicate and completely unflinching at the same time. At the heart of ADAM BEDE is a story so sordid I wonder whether it could be broadcast on network TV today, and Eliot tells it without vulgarity but without ever shying away from its ugliness. My most serious criticism of the book is that Eliot didn't quite trust herself enough not to tack an unconvincing (and, worse, uninteresting) happy ending onto her story. But the hair-raising drive of the middle two-thirds of the book is something you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"I love Marion Evans and expect others would enjoy her very much too. I'm writing this review to make sure that, if Adam Bede is your first experience with her, you not judge her by it and, if there is anything you find you like in it, that you go on and read more by her... Silas Marner, Middlemarch, essays, etc.Adam Bede is, if I recall correctly, one of her earliest (if not first) extended works... the rest only get better. It is the only one that I would give less than five stars. There's really only one thing that mars it.But first, what's good about it? Well, there's her deeply probing, psychological characterizations that leave all of her characters fully understood by the reader. We may love, admire, sympathize with, hope for, dislike, or disapprove of them. But we always understand them. Even the most minor characters or bit parts get well-developed. She puts more into a characterization of dogs than some writers do of humans... and it's clear that she loves them both very much!Then there's her beautifully dense english: within a single sentence she can present a thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. She has the most charitable way of using irony I've ever encountered. Also, she was very much to British vernacular what Mark Twain was to American vernacular. This is especially marked in Adam Bede and may lead some people to shy away from it.Also, she takes on the big issues of her day... political and religious change, the position of women and the otherwise disenfranchised, etc... in a way and to an extent that no one else in her day was doing. It's somewhat stealthy at times, being cloaked in the lives of the individuals who are affected by the issues. Not infrequently her own views come, comically, from the mouths of those who must otherwise be taken to least likely represent them... very sly. An example from Middlemarch flows from the nontraditional Dorothea's very traditional sister: \\"Oh, women are better than men at most everything [Dorothea smiling in response and her sister catching herself]... excepting of course the things they're not I mean!\\". I think her writing definitely stands the test of time.Now what's bad? One thing only... Adam Bede has one radical plot twist that's either physiologically impossible or relies on the unbelievable ignorance of most of the characters. I can only imagine that the twist was less perverse to the Victorian reader's sensibility but it left me cold near the end of an otherwise warm, engaging, moving work by a great writer."},{"Title":"Adam Bede","review":"This world-famous novel is all about love and loss and making choices in marriage. Adam loves Hetty who loves Arthur who is a scoundrel. Hetty gets pregnant by Arthur, who deserts her, despite Adam's efforts to save her.

I have serveral others of hers but I alway seemed to have another book I wanted to read. In fact, I started Adam Bede once and was about 150 pages into and put it down. After 6 months or so, I decided to pick it back up and I am glad that I did.This is a wonderful story about a person who is true to himself and to those around him. This is also a story about how the actions of a person affect more than that person and those immediately involved.The only problem I had with the story (and thus the 4 stars) was the dialect of the language used in the book. It is difficult to get used to the dialect and it is difficult to know what the character is trying to say. However, after the first 200 pages, I did get the hang of it but it was difficult going at first. In fact, it was because of that difficulty that I put the book down before.I was glad to have read this book. It does have a shocking part to it though it is subtle at first. What really helped me was to read several chapters and then go the the sparknotes and read them to make sure I had not missed anything which was a big help in fully understanding the story. I would recommend that if you read this book, read the sparknotes after every 4 or 5 chapters.I would also recommend this book to anyone that likes Thomas Hardy and espcially his \\"Far from the Madding Crowd.\\" I loved \\"Madding Crowd\\" and this book reminded me of it.I truly recommend this book to anyone that likes English Classic Literature.

Evans grew up in Warwickshire and knew rural England like the back of her hand. It was with this background allied with her literary genius that persuaded her in 1859 to write her first full length novel \\"Adam Bede. She did so at the urging of her longtime lover George Henry Lewes. After a career penning short stories, literary reviews and translation she was ready to begin one of the greatest careers in all of English fiction. Eliot produced such masterpieces as \\"Silas Marner\\"; \\"The Mill on the Floss\\"; \\"Daniel Deronda\\"; \\"Romola\\" and her lengthy masterpiece \\"Middlemarch\\"Adam Bede occurs in the time of the Napoleonic wars. Adam Bede and his brother Seth are carpenters living in the small village of Hayslope. Their mother is the cranky but good Lisbeth. The novel begins as a young female Methodist preacher the fetching Diane Morris is preaching in the village square. Seth is in love with her but his dreams of matrimony will not be fulfilled. Adam is smitten with the seventeen year old featherhead but lovely Hetty Sorrel. Hetty is an orphan who lives with her relatives the Poyser family at the Hall farm. Hetty will be seduced by the rich but weak willed Arthur Donnithorne. He will abandon her; she will kill her baby and plans on being married to Adam. Hetty is tried for murder but at the last minute is saved by a reprieve won for her by the repentant Arthur. Diane and Adam marry. Order and tranquility are restored to Hayslope but Eliot and her readers of 1860 knew that the rural life of sixty years before would soon yield to the encroachments of industrialism.Adam Bede is a leisurely novel with a slow pace. We see the seasons unfold in all their English glory; met the Poysers and the garrulous Mrs. Poyser and her passel of children. We attend drinking and harvest parties and catch up on the gossip with the \\"rude mechanicals\\" of the town who share their folk wisdom and foolishness with the reader. Much of the book is written in a dialect but this is understandable and not an obstacle in perusing Adam Bede's many pages.Although an agnostic, Eliot displays a deep knowledge of the Christian Bible and teaches us about the early Methodist movement in these pages. Many of the characters such as Adam, Seth and other characters have biblical names.Hetty Sorrel reminds this reviewer of the character of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" of 1850. Unlike Hester, however, we see little moral growth in the soul of Hetty. Eliot had an understanding for those under a moral black cloud due to her unorthodox relationship with Lewes. Her style probes psychological corners of the human soul. Eliot wrote for literate adults producing a work of beauty, wisdom and love. She is the brighest of Victorian novelists and one of the best.

It is there that he proves that he is responsible, reliable, and capable of taking care of himself. This story teaches children to be responsible. It also lets them know that one day their parents will stop being as protective over them. The story also teaches children to listen to what their parents have to say because one day it will pay off.

Although the few Americans who bother to defend the idea are usually smeared as \\"neo-Confederates\\" or worse (is there anything worse?), a simple look at the last decade's headlines shows that secession is not only an idea, but an event, all over the world. From Quebec to Yugoslavia, the Baltic States to Chechnya, Scotland to Los Angeles, people are willing to defy the holy memory of St. Abraham Lincoln and \\"dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another.\\" Gordon and his contributors have rediscovered, dusted off, and re-articulated for a new century one of the most basic political rights of all, the right of self-determination.A large portion of this collection of essays, as you might expect, examines the pre-eminent example of secession in American history, the Confederacy. The three essays dealing with this period -- Joseph Stromberg's \\"Republicanism, Federalism, and Secession in the South, 1790-1865;\\" Thomas DiLorenzo's \\"Yankee Confederates: New England Secession Movements Prior to the War Between the States;\\" and James Ostrowski's \\"Was the Union Army's Invasion of the Confederate States a Lawful Act? An Analysis of President Lincoln's Legal Arguments Against Secession\\" -- form the core of the book. However, this title is more than just an apologetic for the South. Philosophical, legal, and political analyses by other contributors provide a solid framework for secession as a political theory in our era as well.The last essay, Bruce Benson's look at arbitration as an alternative to state-run judicial systems in commerce and trade, provides a true-life example of a type of modern individual \\"secession,\\" and recalls Mises' suggestion (quoted by several contributors) that the right to secession can ultimately be carried down to the community, home, and even individual level. Murray Rothbard reinforces this idea in \\"Nations by Consent: Decomposing the Nation State.\\"This is a very important and valuable book, challenging as it does the accepted, post-1865 wisdom of Constitutional interpretation. Secession didn't die at Appomattox, either as a political theory or as a right inherent to each state in the American union. As several of the contributors note, secession (and the threat of it) is the single most powerful check on the expansion of federal power -- which, of course, explains why, from Lincoln on down, so many people have worked so feverishly to discredit it. But truth is just truth, and no matter how hard the \\"enlightened\\" classes try to deny it, analyses like the ones in this collection show that a true idea cannot be silenced forever."},{"Title":"Secession, State, and Liberty","review":"I read in threes and fours on any given topic, and in some ways I regret getting to this book last, but on the other hand, having read the other books below first, it makes me appreciate, and be willing to certify, that this one book is the one to buy if you only want to read one book on the topic.See my reviews of the following for additional background:Is Secession Treason?One Nation, Indivisible?

The two-party tyranny and the predatory immoral tyranny of Wall Street and its front, the Federal Reserve (neither Federal nor Reserve) must be abolished, and the sovereignty of the people restored.It is in the context of the above books that I appreciate this one, edited by David Gordon, so very much.Despite the urgency and substance of this book, it is not one of those Amazon considers worthy of scanning and providing inside the book, and the publisher has failed to use all the tools that Amazon provides including the ability to upload the table of contents and a free chapter, so below are the contents and a one line appreciation.0. Introduction (David Gordon). Great overview, snippets on each author's work and its relevance. BOTTOM LINE: Declaration of Independence is the foundation for secession whenever a government \\"becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.\\"1. The Secession Tradition in America (Donald Livingston). Great prefatory stuff on church secessions. Key sentence: \\"It [Declaration of Independence] is not primarily an argument for individual rights, but rather an argument for the corporate rights of distinct moral and political societies.\\" Superb itemization of the many falsehoods that Lincoln put forth, and notes that after the war of Independence the British recognized EACH state as its own sovereign state, not the \\"bundle\\" of states.2. When is Political Divorce Justified? (Steven Yates). This chapter hinges on consent of the governed and the right to withdraw when the government either ignores its levitate functions and/or undertakes tasks it should not perform and is not authorized to perform. Anticipates tyranny in the USA, and points out that Lincoln's bloodshed while not quite equal to that of Hitler's or Stalin's, was easily unjustified and clearly associated with an attempt to impose a tyranny on the South that the North had no right to impose.3. The Ethics of Secession (Scott Boykin). This is a philosophical argument with structure and conclusions, very elegant, concluding that any group that wishes to define itself as a political unit, irrespective of ethnic or other blood issues, is free to do so by natural law.4. Nations By Consent: Decomposing the Nation-State. Key point here is that nations are not states, and the artificiality of nation-states as imposed by the Treaty of Westphalia (seeThe Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State, is actually a crime against humanity (my interpretation) and therefore all those who are tribes of nations apart from the artificial states have every right to secede, and indeed we have seen just that in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Africa is next, in my opinion.5. Secession: The Last, Best Bulwark of Our Liberties (Clyde N. Wilson). Republics have free citizens, Empires have subjects.6. Republicanism, Federalism, and Secession in the South, 1790 to 1865 (Joseph R. Stromberg). Great history focused on the STATES, each entering into a COMPACT and each RETAINING sovereignty.7. Yankee Confederates: New England Secession Movements Prior to the War Between the States (Thomas DiLorenzo). New England validated the right first.8. Was the Union Army's Invasion of the Confederate States a Lawful Act? An Analysis of President Lincoln's Legal Arguments Against Secession (James Ostrowski). Lincoln will lose his luster in time--he confused four separate aspects, and however laudable his intentions, he murdered over 600,000 of his countrymen, destroyed the South, and OCCUPIED the South for 12 years. History will not be kind once history is written by proper Truth & Reconciliation Commissions.9. The Economic and Political Rationale for European Secessionism (Hana-Hermann Hoppe). This is a deep piece, very current (break-up of USSR) and it touches on the mutual interests of Western empire states and post-communist dictatorships.10. A Secessonist's View of Quebec's Options (Pierre Desrochers and Eric Duhaine). Since this was written, Canada' Supreme Court has ruled that Quebec has every right to secede any time it wishes.11. How to Secede in Business Without Really Leaving: Evidence of the Substitution of Arbitration for Litigation (Bruce L. Benson. This one troubles me--the author favors arbitration as a way of avoiding state control, but I for one fear arbitration because it negates the right to a jury trial , and while few know this, juries can not only find one innocent, they can overturn the law within which one is being charged.Appendices include the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, The Constitution of the United States (note that it is the STATES that united), and the Constitution of the Confederate States. The Index is fairly well done, best on proper names, not quite as thorough as I would have liked on secession and slavery and the role of the banks in causing the war.Overall, a phenomenal book, very timely, and the one book to buy if you get only one (read my reviews of the others, I do summative reviews)."},{"Title":"Secession, State, and Liberty","review":"This book is the best discussion on the subject of Secession I have ever seen.

It deals with one of the most overlooked issues in political theory, secession. Although most people think that the American Civil War settled the issue for all time, the authors of this book beg to differ. From a variety of different vantage points and ideologies, secession is given the support that it so deserves. Secession is rooted in individual liberty and any opposition ultimately requires an outright act of force. It is this crucial fact that much of this book is based upon. Issues of secession, past, present, and future are all dealt with accordingly. This book should be on the bookshelf of every individual with a serious interest in libertarian political philosophy."},{"Title":"Secession, State, and Liberty","review":"Today's growth of federal government has given rise to an idea that some would have rejected outright only a few years ago-the right to secession. This tome is collection of writings from various advocates of the idea of smaller, more localized government.Topics ranged from the founding fathers ideas of secession to the discussion of modern day examples of secession found in the balkans and the baltic states as well as the proposed separation of Quebec from Canada. As this was written in the mid 1990s, some of the material is dated. Hans-Hermann Hoppe's prediction that the EU would not be sucessful in creating a unified currency has been proven wrong.Some of the material, especially the last essay \\"How to Secede in Business Without Really Leaving: Evidence of the Substitution of Arbitration for Litigation.\\" was dry and hard to understand.

The authors adequately defend the necessity of secession &amp; decentralization for the advance of liberty, but the analysis does not go much beyond that. There is altogether too much material on the War between the States, an event that happened 150 years ago and has little relevance for the philosophical, political, economic, and even legal issues facing secessionists today. There is very little empirical content, very little attempt to explain why secessionist movements arise and how they can succeed.I am very glad this book was made: it serves a certain purpose. However, we need sophisticated social scientists studying secessionism from a sympathetic perspective. See my other reviews of books on secessionism that deal with the issue from an empirical, comparative perspective."},{"Title":"Raggedy Ann and Andy help Santa Claus (A little golden book)","review":"ASIN B00072PERK - Little Golden Books and Christmas... two of my favorite things! Raggedy Ann and Andy, I've never been a great fan, but their story is a nice one.Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy and all the other dolls quietly wait for Santa's arrival. When he appears, he sits for a moment to have milk and cookies. The clock strikes the hour and Santa realizes he must be on his way. The Old House, which had been empty for a long time, has three children there now and Santa has gifts to bring them. Once he's gone, Raggedy Ann finds a doll meant for the Old House children, so the dolls make a plan to get the toy there. When they finally get there, Santa is just about to go down the chimney - and he's very grateful for their help!The first thing that popped into my head, as the dolls make elaborate plans for getting to the Old House, was Toy Story.

His vignettes, from traveling around the world to gather the news on the latest developments in climate science, are captivating. The book is very up-to-date on the science, and explains many of the crucial aspects of Earth that climate scientists don't yet understand well.The book is also scary, because most of these things that we don't understand well mean we're underestimating the amount of change that global warming will reap."},{"Title":"Last Generation","review":"Once, climate was seen like a sedate matron, ambling along at a measured pace. According to Fred Pearce, the climate is more like a drunk, lurching from one place to another in sporadic, unpredictable lunges. Rapid climate change was once considered a local phenomenon. Older, unprepared civilisations in one region staggered under shifts of weather, collapsing in the heat, but easily replaced by more efficient neighbours. Research has shown, argues Pearce, that the entire globe is interconnected through complex patterns. Even the starting points of climate changes are hidden in the mists of time. Until today. Now it's the byproducts of our society that are prompting the changes. How drastic these may be and where the changes will be most severe is the subject of this excellent, if very frightening account.Fred Pearce has been in the climate investigation reporting business for nearly twenty years. He knows the players and he understands their work. His intimate knowledge of their views and the science behind those outlooks provide a sound foundation for his summation of how climate change is occurring. And it is occurring, he argues. It's happening so fast that he can confidently assert that this is \\"The Last Generation\\" that will enjoy anything like climate stability. That lurching drunk is more powerful and less predictable than previously imagined.With his long experience to buttress his presentation, Pearce covers all the bases. Moving from polar ice through ocean currents to wind patterns, he provides a thorough examination of the issues and the people studying them. The eminent Wally Broecker, who proposed \\"the Great Ocean Conveyor\\" circulating polar water around the globe is carefully described. Pearce doesn't want to invoke Broecker's ire over a mis-statement. Lonnie Thompson, who has likely spent more time above 6000 metres altitude than any other lowlander alive, offers his critique of Broecker's model as the initiator of climate change. These men are the \\"elder statesmen\\" of climate investigation. The journalist has met them all, but he also introduces us to the \\"newcomers\\" in the field. Peter deMenocal is continuing the work of Gerard Bond on \\"solar pulses\\" of energy, while Mike Mann's \\"hockey stick\\" graph of temperature increase updated Charles Keeling's earlier records on carbon dioxide increase rates. In a few cases, the later worker has almost eclipsed his forbear as Milutin Milankovich is the name associated with relating climate with Earth's orbital shifts instead of that of James Croll, the crofter's son who worked that out in the late 19th Century.New minds, asking new questions and probing with modern instruments, have produced fresh viewpoints on climate change. The most significant pattern among those views is that major climate change is in the offing. It will be likely very soon and very abrupt. Warming air and warming seas are providing lubricant for the ice caps in Greenland and the Antartic. Will these ice mountains soon slide into their neighbouring oceans? El Nino, the enigmatic countervailing wind in the Pacific Ocean is becoming more frequent in its occurrences. Are we headed for a permanent state of monsoon-inhibiting forces? Neither simple nor immediate answers are availble to answer those questions, as Pearce and his interviewees admit. That circumstance gives the \\"climate sceptics\\" a wedge to challenge the whole idea of climate change as a serious threat. The author draws on his resources to dismiss that objection, asserting that even the resistance to anthropogenic causes of today's climate disruptions no longer is tenable.For Pearce, the issue isn't whether climate change is occurring - it is, and we are the cause - but rather how rapidly it will develop into a clearly visible threat. It's not important who's \\"leading the dance\\", the Poles or the Tropics, it's important that we recognise that threatening change is taking place now. Since the impact is already apparent, we must undertake efforts to reduce the effects and protect ourselves. We have already created \\"Another Planet\\" by the introduction of massive use of fossil fuels. Our children will be living on that orb, and we must help safeguard their future. He adopts a list of solutions originally proposed by Robert Socolow of Princeton University. These \\"wedges\\" - so called because they will start as minimal changes, but grow in strength and effectiveness with the passage of time - will reduce the load of carbon we're placing into the environment and let us return to a more stable climate condition. If the Earth needs an AA to survive, it is these wedges that will provide the therapy. The time to apply those restoratives, however, is NOW.

Later, he lived a blasphemous and destructive life after being impressed into the British navy, punished as a deserter and sent to service on a slave ship. Even after his earliest conversion he engaged in the slave trade, ultimately as a captain, before quitting that business which he found disgusting. He found new employment, new friends in the Evangelical community, and with his young wife, Mary, at first settled in Liverpool. His independent biblical and theological studies set him on a course that tied him closely with members of the English Evangelical movement but ultimately resulted in his ordination as a clergyman in the Church of England. Hindmarsh has carefully detailed Newton's growth over many years toward maturity and service as an Anglican parish minister and a preacher often mistaken for a Methodist because of his exuberance. Of course, Newton wrote hundreds of hymns for his parishioners to sing in worship services. The most famous today is &quot;Faith's Review and Expectation,&quot; or &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot; This is a scholarly book, well worth the price if you're serious about understanding Newton's theology, his rich and admirable service as a parish priest, his personal warmth and commitment to the people he served, and his historical significance as an Anglican who was a sort of bridge between his own church and the broad Evangelical movement during his long and productive life. Hindmarsh has done a great job of humanizing Newton; after reading this fine book I admire Newton so much because of the rich, committed life he lived for many years after he found conversion and quit the slave trade."},{"Title":"Colour Scheme: Library Edition","review":"I've come back to this gem at least four times -- though another reviewer says explicitly that he would not be back.My reasons for returning?First, the land. New Zealand is a character here, and it's delineated by Marsh with the kinds of detail that made travelogues interesting, back before television showed us everywhere all at once. The light, the flora, the geology... it's all like a Turner watercolor, fascinating light plays and landscapes, where the weather and warmth is pervasive.Second, there is the humor. There are fascinating caricatures of the British 'high-toned' expatriate family in straightened means, the self-centered movie star of the 1940s, the Callow Youth (all provincial slang, worn like a flashy shirt), the Crass Businessman. Seeing much of the interplay through Dikon's down-to-earth eyes -- acting as the chorus of the play, observing and summarizing -- makes it even funnier.The land between the Maoris and the Claires is one that you'll remember. It's as sinister as Conan Doyle's moor in Hound of the Baskervilles and equally bathed in wrenching sights and sounds.And everything moves in and out of surrealism: a real train bears down on a fantastic landscape, Gaunt's posturing suddenly gives way to a moment of genuine generosity (or is it?), walkers fearfully pick their way along paths through dangerous hot springs... It's fun to see Barbara emerge as enticing despite her continuous mugging and 'attitudes'... doubtless derived from the kinds of movies that Gaunt makes...A final thought: while Colour Scheme is among Marsh's best, it probably is not the best choice for a first sampling of Roderick Alleyn at work. Light Thickens would be my candidate for that -- among the last of Marsh's mysteries, it beautifully melds human motivations and actions with the theater (and within that, one of theater's most theatric of plays, Macbeth).But, as a kind of side-note into Alleyn's life, and a commentary on World War II in the South Pacific, and a grouping of often hilarious caricatures, Colour Scheme is a worthy read."},{"Title":"Colour Scheme: Library Edition","review":"Knowing that Ngaio Marsh lived in New Zealand, it made sense that she would situate one of her mysteries in her beloved adopted country. In this book Inspector Alleyn is in New Zealand during World War II to do a bit of \\"spy busting\\". As in all her books, this one has a flawlessly written plot with a very tight story line. In the keeping of a \\"spy story\\", Ms. Marsh's Alleyn does not appear as himself. He appears in the story in a very clever disguise, and the reader will have the fun of figuring out who he is. It took me a little while. What Alleyn has come to the spa to investigate is the death of one of the people who had an interest in the spa. We meet some very unique characters in this book. The Colonel's family is quite wonderful actually.Ms. Marsh can tell a tale!"},{"Title":"Colour Scheme: Library Edition","review":"Set in New Zealand during World War II this is very much a crime novel of its time. Hot springs are a good place to stay to relieve muscular aches and pains and an ill assorted group of people gather in an out of the way spa to try and ease their chronic problems. But there is evil afoot and whispers of fifth columnists operating in the area and sending signals to the enemy. Then there's the obnoxious Mr Questing who has some sort of hold over the owner of the spa. When Questing disappears almost anyone could have had means motive and opportunity.This is an interesting crime novel with plenty of clues for the observant reader. With Roderick Alleyn loosely disguised this is a book which would puzzle any reader not familiar with the series. For those who have read other books by this author he is easy to spot. I enjoyed the story and thought the plot was well constructed but I found I kept losing track of who was who. Maybe I was in the wrong mood for the book. It is an enjoyable read for Ngaio Marsh fans but it would not be the best book to start with if you are new to her books."},{"Title":"Colour Scheme: Library Edition","review":"Set during World War II, the 1942 COLOUR SCHEME concerns a noted stage star, Geoffrey Gaunt, who finds himself afflicted with \\"fibrosistis.\\" Electing to soak himself in the sulfurous mud baths at Wai-ata-tapu, Gaunt finds himself at an isolated and very ramshackle guest house incompetently run by the well-meaning but exceedingly provincial Claire family, who are beset by the singularly unpleasant Maurice Questing.Questing has an unknown hold over the family--and an incredibly boorish manner to boot--but does he have anything to do with the flashing lights seen on the hillside inside the native Maori preserve? Lights that may signaled to enemy agents watching, and sinking, military ships? Certainly various members of the Claire family believe so. The speculation is enough to attract the interest of Inspector Alleyn, on wartime duty from his native England. And when murder at last rears its ugly head it proves unexpectedly horrific.COLOUR SCHEME finds Marsh writing at full power, and it is a memorable melange of beautifully rendered characters, atmospheric setting, and intricate plot. In spite of this, however, I find it among my least favorite of her novels--for the characters are among the least likable she ever created, ranging from the downright disgusting to the tiresomely egotistical to the merely stupid. While this should not detract from a first-time reader's enjoyment, it certainly doesn't make this a novel that you will likely care to revisit--and as such I give it four instead of five stars.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Colour Scheme: Library Edition","review":"Colour SchemeI enjoy this sort of read and i like the way the author has written her story.

Suspicions about enemy agents and plots to infiltrate the country are rife, including at the thermal spa Wai-ata-Tapu Springs, a retreat that espouses the healing nature of the mud springs. Unfortunately, the spa is run by the inept Clare family, who are in very real danger of losing ownership to one of their few guests, the unsavory and much disliked Maurice Questing. Questing has some undisclosed hold on the family patriarch, Colonel Questing, and makes it clear that he plans to eventually take control and completely alter the spa. His initial steps to accomplish that goal include inviting a famous Shakespearean actor, Geoffrey Gaunt, to the spa for a cure of his muscle disorder. Gaunt and his secretary Dikon have many reserves about the trip but eventually agree. Questing's overbearing and egomaniacal character soon put Gaunt, like the rest of the spa's inhabitants, at odds with him.When Questing suddenly disappears, thought to have been the victim of a land slide that catapulted him into one of the boiling mud pits, his death is labeled a possible homicide. Unfortunately, none of the spa's residents have a very convincing alibi and they all have very good reasons for wanting Questing dead. Did one of them take matters into their own hands? Or was Questing really an enemy agent who cleverly staged his own demise? Also suspected are several of the inhabitants of a nearby native Maori village. The local police become involved but are stumped until aided by a very observant character...who finally reveals his true identity as Inspector Roderick Alleyn at the close of the book.Ngaio Marsh is one of my favorite mystery writers but I must say that this book is one of her less enjoyable Alleyn mysteries. The action is slow, the characters are not very interesting or appealing and the setting, though picturesque and clearly reflective of her love for her home country, is not well described.

This isn't the worst that Miss Marsh penned. (That dubious honor must go to the ploddingOverture to Death.)

(Actually, I didn't realize he was in the novel until late in the 11th chapter!) As others have mentioned, the description of Rotorua on the North Island was enchanting; I loved learning about the Maoris and the thermal springs.

It is fine reading for anyone interested in the Western.Kitses has added a marvelous chapter on John Ford, which examines all Ford's westerns from Stagecoach (1939) to Cheyenne Autumn (1964). Kitses' comments are sensible and to the point. His discussion of The Searchers is very well done, and he raises excellent points about The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Also, he has written good analysis of Sergeant Rutledge and Two Rode Together, two late Westerns that few critics pay attention to.Kitses has left the text of his original work alone, except for adding some to the Peckinpah chapter. While his comments on Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid are perceptive, the Peckinpah chapter is probably the weakest in the book. I am not sure if Kitses dislikes Peckinpah or if he disliked critics who like Peckinpah.Kitses then adds two chapters, one of Sergio Leone and one on Clint Eastwood. The Leone chapter is okay but is far colder than the rest of the book. However, the chapter on Eastwood is terrific, one that strikes a fine balance between praise for his achievements and an awareness of the flaws in those achievements. This is perhaps some of the best serious analysis of Eastwood as a director that I have read.Strongly recommended for all readers interested in Westerns."},{"Title":"Horizons West: Directing the Western from John Ford to Clint Eastwood (Film Classics S.)","review":"Back in the late 1960s Jim Kitses wrote an enjoyable study of three western directors who at the time were not nearly as highly regarded as they are today. His chapters on Anthony Mann and Budd Boetticher were marvelous because both directors had pretty much completed their contibutions to the western genre. The chapter on Sam Peckinpah left something to be desired since, at the time, Peckinpah had only three feature films--all of them westerns--under his belt. This new edition addresses that problem by providing a career-length reassessment of Peckinpah's contributions to the western. The other new material--mainly on John Ford and Clint Eastwood--is certainly readable, but I'm not certain that it was essential. Nevertheless it is good to have this volume back in print once more."},{"Title":"Horizons West: Directing the Western from John Ford to Clint Eastwood (Film Classics S.)","review":"\\"Horizons West\\" is subtitled \\"Directing The Western From John Ford To Clint Eastwood\\" and it reads as a powerful primer on creating, directing, and dissecting the Western movie genre. It is an excellent revision of the original 1969 book that includes newer perspectives as well as adds the work of Ford, Leone, and Eastwood. It is a scholarly effort that is well researched, annotated, and footnoted with an excellent bibliography and filmography included.After opening with generic comments regarding the practice and theory of directing the Western and an overview of the history and development of the genre, Kitses explores in some depth the westerns of six acknowledged masters of the Western movie. He uses the great John Ford as his stepping stone to future Western movie directors including Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone, and, lastly, Clint Eastwood.\\"Horizons West\\" reads like a college text which it likely is in some places. Students of the Western movie genre or just plain fans of Westerns should enjoy the rich detail provided by Kitses as he dissects each of the major efforts of the six directors in search of recurring themes, perspectives, controversies, and, in general, the stories behind the story. It is illuminating to explore how Ford matured and changed his perspectives over his career, how Peckinpah's career was constantly a battle with studio bosses, and how and why Leone and Eastwood drifted apart over the years. I always find it intriguing to discover which actors had originally been offered and rejected roles that later made someone else famous (such as James Coburn and Charles Bronson turning down Leone's Man-With-No-Name trilogy that skyrocketed Eastwood to fame).This is a fact filled text filled with detail and perspective on many of the most famous Western movies made. A number of photos of actors and sets are included as is information on who wrote, starred in, and produced most of them. I heartily recommend this effort to fans and students of the Western movie and its place in American cinema history."},{"Title":"Horizons West: Directing the Western from John Ford to Clint Eastwood (Film Classics S.)","review":"There is no question Jim Kitses knows intimately the movies he explores in this work. There also is no question that Kitses offers some thoughtful and very valuable insights into the Western films of these directors. But the book is deeply flawed by his pedantic writing style. He is not a clever or colorful wordsmith, to put it politely. If you buy this book, don't even bother with the long-winded and wooden introduction trying his explain his point of view. It is close to impenetrable and he appears obsessed with gender politics (perhaps he has been infected by living and working in San Francisco for too long). Worse, in many places in the book he insists on arguing with other reviewers of the same films. Obviously, they aren't even present to defend their views and what they had to say is almost always very briefly paraphrased and characterized, so Kitses trumps them every time by having the final (and much more developed) word. The many bogus debates sidetracked and, in many cases, diluted the otherwise well-reasoned opinions and detailed insight he had to offer. A good but less than great read is the result."},{"Title":"A Blue Tale and Other Stories","review":"This collection of three stories were the last of her fiction to be translated into English.

A key to the entire region is the city of Tyre--easilly defensible, rich, and with strategic value, Tyre is ruled by Conrad and his wife Isabelle, Queen of Jerusalem. A strong ruler like Conrad, one who planned to stay in the holy land rather than simply fight there, could be a key to peace with Saladin and a continued Christian presence in Palestine. But the forces against Conrad, perhaps including his own queen, are powerful indeed. Could fools Theophilos and Scarlet the Dwarf hope to cobble together a motley of self-interest that can create a peaceful middle-east?Author Alan Gordon gives an intriguing spin to a fascinating and horrible period of history. The old Byzantine Empire is struggling but has not yet had its heart ripped out by the fourth crusade. Richard is the master of battle but is also a master of gratuitous violence. And the misnamed King of Jerusalem (because the crusader states had lost that city) is dead leaving no clear heir and too many claimants. But THE WIDOW OF JERUSALEM is not merely interesting as a historical view. Gordon makes the characters, including the historical nobility and the fictional jesters and servants, come alive. The mysterious death of a young woman propells Theophilos and Scarlet's band of trainee fools into an intrigue that will alter the control of this land, and the hearts of many.THE WIDOW OF JERUSALEM is written as a recounting of a story by Theophilos to his wife Claudia. Although this style tends to distance the reader from the story, in this case, it worked, allowing Gordon to introduce occasional side-notes of levity into the telling. Fans of historical fiction who have yet to make the acquaintence of Theophilos and the Jester's Guild will definitely want to do so. Gordon fans will be overjoyed to see Theophilos and Claudia in action yet again."},{"Title":"Widow of Jerusalem: A Medieval Mystery","review":"Having enjoyed the three previous novels in Alan Gordon's series, I eagerly awaited The Widow of Jerusalem, and it didn't disappoint. In fact, I think might be his best work yet. Theophilus the Fool, with his usual wit, tells us a story of murder and intrigue--one of history's actural mysteries--set in Tyre during the Third Crusade. That the story is told as a flashback to thirteen years earlier doesn't detract at all from the reading experience, because the transitions from 1204 to 1191 are handled so skillfully. And that I wasn't persuaded to believe Theophilus's theory on whodunit in reality didn't lessen my enjoyment of this novel a bit. Gordon does an excellent job of bringing the late 12th/early 13th centuries to life, and his humor never fails to make me laugh out loud while reading. I highly recommend this novel to those who like real history in their mysteries."},{"Title":"Widow of Jerusalem: A Medieval Mystery","review":"I have to agree with all the other reviewers so far. This is a really good story for anyone who likes medieval fiction taken from historical fact. As a lover of historical fiction, usually the medieval stories are pretty grim. Although this certainly has its horrific events, the story is told through the words of a &quot;fool&quot; which makes the word play and the observations witty and insightful. The character of the dwarf, Scarlet, will always be one of my favorites. If you like the middle ages and mystery with a dash of humor, this is it."},{"Title":"Widow of Jerusalem: A Medieval Mystery","review":"The Fool's Guild turns out jesters and troubadours and sends them out in the world to entertain the various classes. They are also brilliant intelligence gathers who work behind the scenes to try and maintain the peace and when that is impossible influence the nobles into situations that will settle hostilities. Theophilus, a very good Fool, is sent by the Guild to Acre in the year 1191 to help his colleague Scarlet the Dwarf end the Third Crusade and bring peace to the region.The two Fools divert supplies meant for Richard the Lionhearted sending them to the city of Tyre whose leaders are allowing the refugees displaced by the war to live in a tent city outside the walls. The Queen of Jerusalem Isabelle and her husband Conrad, the Marquis of Montferrat supply them with food whenever they can. Scarlet who is devoted to his queen urges her to marry Champagne when her husband is murdered. When the crusaders return home Theophilus goes with them but he has to return years later and to finally figure who was behind the conspiracy that led to Conrad's death.Readers will be amazed by what the Fools can accomplish as spies working behind the scene to maneuver political events. Theophilus is a fascinating character who operates on different levels with different people. His skills as an entertainer enable him to spy on the nobles when they are plotting something because they underestimate the intelligence of a Fool. WIDOW OF JERUSALEM is a fascinating look at the various players who have a pivotal role in the Third Crusade.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"GEORGE MACDONALD AN ANTHOLOGY","review":"George McDonald has lots to say about how to act when you are not feeling well loved or connected to God. In short, how do we act when we're unsure of our faith or angry?For example:The Highest Condition of the Human WillThe highest condition of the human will is in sight. . . . I say not the highest condition of the Human Being; that surely lies in the Beatific Vision, in the sight of God. But the highest condition of the Human Will, as distinct, not as separated from God, is when, not seeing God, not seeming to grasp Him at all, it yet holds Him fast.-George McDonald quoted in C.S.

I think it's great that he wanted to have an anthology of George Macdonald, but it just didn't work. Don't get me wrong, the quotes are great, but it just doesn't really give you an idea of who Goerge MacDonald is, and what his writing is like. Nearly all of the quotations are from his book of sermons, which is not one of his most popular works. If you have heard of George MacDonald and want to check him out, I would reccomend just jumping straight into The Princess and the Goblin or one of his other works.

The little writing that Lewis contributes is in an insightful introduction, which gives great perspective into the position of MacDonald and his theology. As Paul exhorted, MacDonald has indeed sought wisdom from above, and not of this world. The best description I can use is soul piercing. It's a wonder MacDonald is hardly mentioned or known in the Christian culture as a whole. It's no wonder Lewis called him his master -- I don't doubt many more will as they learn of him, including myself."},{"Title":"GEORGE MACDONALD AN ANTHOLOGY","review":"I am halfway through the book and can't express how much it has spoken to me. The book is divided up into short, numbered sections, all less than half-a-page long; some as short as a sentence, and the reason is this: it is so rich with insight you cannot consume it in large gulps. You need to savor it, like fudge, to make sure you are relishing all that's there. I personally limit myself to about 10 sections per morning and I pause to journal and reflect on most.I don't think I would have been ready to listen to MacDonald a few years ago. He writes from a deep, still place of ruthless, rugged faith. It's particularly rewarding for me to read snippets of his theological thoughts having just read his Curdie books. I notice many of his reflections showing up in the pages of his fiction. I also see the origination of much of C.S. Lewis's thinking and fiction.Buy it and try it.

If you want emotion and reason to pull together to reveal truth, then it flounders.Even as does C.S. Lewis, George McDonald has a tendency to make movingly worded, but scripturally, or even reasonably, baseless statements. Culture and emotion are on his side, but that doesn't make him right.For example, he subtly comes from the perspective that to truly know God is to never to plan, want, or put forth effort. Adam created the names of the animals, king David created the pieces for the temple of Solomon, and Moses gave the people the law. God sustained them and gave them their creative abilities, but it wasn't through sitting around waiting for God that they were able to bring these things about.Further, he has the self righteousness that says \\"what a sinner I am\\", followed by \\"you should do such-and-such\\" or \\"we should all try to do such-and-such\\" meaning \\"you should do such-and-such\\". And has an over inflated view of the righteousness of children.However, I share his view that we are all sinners, held back from becoming monsters by the chains of God, and I identify with his melancholy, but I finish the book holding him in equal regard to C.S. Lewis. Read that however you please."},{"Title":"GEORGE MACDONALD AN ANTHOLOGY","review":"I have never enjoyed the writings of George MacDonald, and even though Lewis tried to select &quot;the best of&quot; with his anthology, I did not benefit from reading this book.

His fantasy novels and sermons have been a source of inspiration for every generation of Christian apologists and fantasy novelists since his death. MacDonald's writings, however, inspiring though they are, are often laborious and difficult to read. Additionally, much of MacDonald's writing phases in and out of print regularly, and is sometimes not easy to find. It is for these reasons that CS Lewis, who called MacDonald \\"my master,\\" compiled this \`anthology' of MacDonald's theology.In this little volume are 365 \\"readings,\\" short quotes from MacDonald's sermons, novels, or stories. Actually, more than 2/3 of this material comes from his sermons. Several of these quotations are uplifting and thought-provoking, and all bear the mark of a man who devoted his life to Christian apology through fantasy. An anthology like this is a good place to be introduced to MacDonald's thinking and writing, and also a large step in understanding such later apologists as CS Lewis. These readings, though sometimes taken slightly out of context, are a great look into the work of George MacDonald."},{"Title":"GEORGE MACDONALD AN ANTHOLOGY","review":"I wouldn't say that this book inspired me to want to read all of George MacDonald's works, but it was worth the money I spent on it. This book gave me some new perspectives on faith and the importance of understand and doing what God wants me to do. I don't agree with all of it, but I was helped by most of it.A few quick samples: &quot;Oh the folly of any mind that would explain God before obeying Him! That would map out the character of God instead of crying, Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?&quot;&quot;Thy hand be on the latch to open the door at His first knock.

Whether George MacDonald's theology was bad or not (and who's isn't at times?), one thing he conveys over and over in his writing is that he KNOWS the love of God. All the good theology in the world cannot measure against instruction about loving God and loving one's neighbor.Personally, I often grow weary of head knowledge and I want to commune with a saint who understands and experiences love to a degree that I can only hope to reach someday. I want to be encouraged that love is action, not theory; that Jesus is reality, not concept; that life is fullness and joy, not numbers and facts. George MacDonald takes me further and beyond the average clich&eacute; and pat descriptions and expectations of the Christian life. He takes me places I always hoped existed and renews my belief that God is much more than I can want or imagine.And for what it's worth, I believe there is another way to interpret statement 1, different from A Reader's interpretation in the following review: \\"Oh the folly of any mind that would explain God before obeying Him! That would map out the character of God instead of crying, Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?\\" I think G. M. meant that spending our time simply amassing facts ABOUT God is a poor substitute for EXPERIENCING God through the act of obedience. In other words, understanding the faith is different from walking by faith.Those are my [opinion]."},{"Title":"GEORGE MACDONALD AN ANTHOLOGY","review":"This anthology is a wonderful collection of beauty and insight into the Christian life.

Though MacDonald's writing style is sometimes clumsy and sometimes confusing, at other times it soars.

Again, Lewis says it best: &quot;I dare not say that he is never in error; but to speak plainly I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer, or more continually close, to the Spirit of Christ Himself.&quot; I can't say enough about this book--full of profound insights!"},{"Title":"GEORGE MACDONALD AN ANTHOLOGY","review":"In CS Lewis' 1945 novel, \\"The Great Divorce,\\" 19th century fantasy poet/pastor George MacDonald guides Lewis' narrarator on passages between hell (the joyless, fearful \\"grey city\\") and heaven. The narrator (by extension, Lewis himself) acknowledges MacDonald's life influence from when, at 16, the then-agnostic Lewis read MacDonald's \\"Phantasies\\" and concluded: \\"Here begins the new life.\\"MacDonald's influence reaches past Lewis to forebears Lewis Carroll (whom MacDonald mentored through Carroll's writing/publishing \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), James Barrie, and GK Chesterton. Barrie and Chesterton helped co-chair MacDonald's centenary celebration in 1924, and Chesterton later called MacDonald \\"one of the three or four greatest men of 19th century Britain.\\"No wonder Lewis prefaces his anthology of MacDonald quotes by calling its compilation \\"discharging a debt of justice.\\" MacDonald, overlooked in a fantasy literature timeline stretching from Lewis and fellow Inkling J.R.R. Tolkein to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, shows his wisdom through 365 excerpts from his poems, sermons, and short stories. Each is less than a page-long for easy daily reading.Referring continually to Lewis' introduction helps while reading his MacDonald selections. Lewis writes, \\"Nowhere else outside the New Testament have I found terror and comfort so intertwined.\\" It guides MacDonald images of the Good Shepherd's sharp-toothed sheepdogs tracking and returning sinners (quote 149), or being told in bereavement \\"you must be made miserable that you may wake from your sleep to know that you need God.\\" (quote 223, from a man who lost a wife and daughter during his life). Even misplaced daily items are God's blessing against materialism (81). Lewis built his \\"Screwtape Letters\\" concept near completely around quotes 245-247.\\"George MacDonald\\" rewards those consistently referencing it. It captures not only MacDonald's freedom from his Calvinist upbringing, but does so though powerful images of Father and Son, Christ and His faithful. It straddles God's demanding \\"the last farthing\\" against sin to man's ability to deny self (159, 300) and see that self as God does (208, 243) before we see Him for what He is. Fear and shame, to MacDonald, are undesirable but acceptable introductions (349, 214, 242), until we know, accept, and obey that deeper love (208, 243).These are excerpts, nothing more. Even praising MacDonald's vision Lewis admits, \\"If I were to deal with him as a writer...certainly MacDonald has no place in its first rank - perhaps not even in its second.\\" Indeed, many MacDonald inspired (again, Lewis' beloved \\"Narnia\\" series) would take his approach to fantasy as a window into human behavior to wildly popular heights a century after his death. \\"George MacDonald\\" is neither biography nor full appreciation.

The work on the city is based on a model from Diderot and Dalambert's Encyclopaedia and is divided into Memory, Reason, and Imagination.There are interlinking storylines and the novel is part love story, part thriller, part comedy, part philosophical investigation.As you can see from the other reviews this novel will polarise opinion. This is a novel that requires you to think. The reader has to play a role in the story. You can not let this novel wash over you, although its length and the beauty of the writing style give you a novel that can be eaten quickly, but you should digest at leisure. To say that this novel encourages you to think may give a misleading impression. It is not an arid dry purely philosophical work.This novel, indeed all of Crumey's fiction, bears comparison with writers such as Borges, Calvino, Tadeusz Konwicki, and Galli. It is as playful as the works of each of these writers, as stimulating, and as enjoyable.It is a work in the modern European style, and harks back to the European novel writing of the eighteenth century.Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"I work in a bookstore and I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy of this book to read. This book was an amazing look at the construction of a fictional city with inhabitants and maps, etc. All the people in a real life kingdom have been chraged by their prince to create the city of Rreinstadt. The kingdom is divided up into departments. Certain people are in charge of creating the people (the Biography department), the city (the Cartography department), and the writing created if any of the &quot;inhabitants&quot; turn out to be writers (the Authorship department). The book centers around a &quot;person&quot; who suddenly appears on a map, but the Biography department has no record of him. As a cartographer starts to look deeper into this unknown creation, he starts to realize that someone in the real world doesn't want him finding out the truth. This amazingly intricate and compelling book was a joy to read"},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"This book cleverly captures the spirit of the 18th century while being very modern in concept. In part it's an update of Jacques The Fatalist by Denis Diderot, which I read for a French Lit course. Like Diderot's book, Pfitz is about a master and servant, full of philosophy and erudite humour. But Crumey's book is no pastiche - he subverts Diderot's idea, adding hints of ETA Hoffman, Goethe and heaven knows what else. An amazing achievement to pack so much into a short and ver funny book. Borgesian? This is nothing like him. It's a highly original book and recommended reading for people who like to have their imagination stretched a little - actually, quite a bit."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"I don't know, I really liked this book for a while. It presented some fantastically challenging ideas and concepts. The thought of an entire group of people living for an imaginary world, the disintegration of the town as a result, the characters merging real and definitely not real...all of it was very intriguing.But this book lost me at the end, which I really felt was a let-down. It was as if Crumey's ideas were even too much for him...the ending simply dissolves away, solving little and not truly melding the two realities together. As an author, what can you really do with characters who decide that composing non-existent places is more important than their actual lives? How much can a reader really sympathize with a man who falls in love with a woman, when neither of them have any emotions at all concerning the absurd nature of their lives? And, the absurdity is never really treated as &quot;absurdity&quot; because of consistency problems. Certain characters even point out that the other world isn't real but it's never followed up.Near the end of _Pfitz_, I found myself wondering why the characters were struggling at all if they really only cared about the imaginary world. Why try to find love? Why kill? Why steal? Why worry about rent? Why do anything except work on the other world? If the true fascination of the book sits within this kingdom's fascination with things that are completely invented, why should we be interested in the -real- things that happen to them. Once I reached this thought, the book was no longer compelling. I just didn't see the point, and reading to the end gave me no reason to change my mind. Crumey never really answers these questions.Sure, the book is an easy read. It's very short and sweet. But it's a little jerky at times, abrupt in presenting ideas and concepts. Good premise, good idea in theory, even witty storytelling at times, but the work as a whole has some serious flaws. And the ending just doesn't deliver."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"What a joy to read a book that's truly unusual in concept. The author blurs the lines between reality and fiction until the reader forgets where the lines were drawn. Fascinating, interesting, and fun."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"The other reviews sum it up: Pfitz is a book you either love or you hate.

A good work of fiction survives without labels, maybe even in spite of labels. This is not a book which follows traditional patterns, characters, events, relationships, beginnings-middles-ends. Maps and cities and people are drawn, built and destroyed, and not necessarily in that order. You read it and you get a sense of wonder, a feeling that somehow, by having read this book, you are a little different, that you are not you, the you that you thought you were. and it is great to feel that way. I know that there will not be rhinoceri or the peddler of the colonel's photographs (Ionesco)in Andrew Crumey's cities or novels, but I will observe them peeking around corners anyway."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"While interesting at times and generally good, it's too formulaically Borgesian and ultimately deals with the whole creator theme with too little subtlety."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"I have read the reviews of Pfitz, but sincerely disagree as it being proclaimed cerebral. While the concept is ok, Crumley eventually loses credibility as a writer with silly 'thought provoking' issues that only Dan Quayle would find fascinating. He tries to throw in too many concepts, and the reader simply loses interest. He even insults literature and authors. I finished the book, and afterward I was longing to read a Jackie Collins novel. I enjoy a rich novel bred from intelligence, but Andrew Crumley's Pfitz was as boring as dirty dish water. If there had been a choice of an 1/8 star, that's what I would've rated this annoying 'book'. I think I found four pages interesting. I will now write something as silly as Pfitz--this book will leave you in fits, and should only be read if one enjoys being annoyed."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"'Pfitz' amounts to no more than Italo Calvino fan fiction. While Crumey sets up a potentially fresh work of postmodernist fantasy, he handles it with the clumsiness of a precocious 14-year-old.Read Diderot's 'Jacques The Fatalist' and Calvino's 'Invisible Cities,' and ignore this useless combination of the two."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"How can you compare this book to the works of Poe? Not even close. I agree with the Jackie Collins review, and was laughing uncontrollably when I read it. What a perfect review."},{"Title":"Pfitz: A Novel","review":"I had to pick a nonamerican author of a novel, and this book sounded great. I like Europe. I thought it had a great start in the first chapter about the Prince who buils 5 cities that fit the imagination, but after that it gets crazy. I mean he doesn't tell you the red head girls name Estrella till chapter 11. He makes it seem that the Prince is the main character and turns out not to be. Mr. Crumey likes to take part in conversations with the reader and interject the story with parenthises stating previous events or his own opinion. I think it was good but a little complicated so if your not into really thinking don't read it. Oh and don't use it for a 4 page book review for English class."},{"Title":"Saving Face: America and the Politics of Shame","review":"Saving Face is a look at American culture and identity through its early roots in shame (when you do not do something you are supposed to do) as opposed to the post-Vietnam guilt culture (when you do something that you are not supposed to do) that we have become.Schneiderman spends most of the book basing America's modern problems on the results of the War in Vietnam; not a rehash of an old subject, but a fresh insight into the modern American psyche. He hypothesizes that the country's loss of face in Vietnam was a clear result of a lack of leadership willing to face the shame and debacle of Vietnam. The vacuum of leadership willing to take responsibility for the results left the nation as scattered individuals, looking for a way to bury the past and restore self pride.Surprisingly, Schneiderman doesn't play politics and lays equal blame both on political leaders for failing to guide the country and on Americans for making poor choices in leadership. Only through self-evaluation and the bearing of shame and personal responsibility can the country as a whole preserve a national culture and move forward.This book is comparable to Philip Howard's Death of Common Sense in that both authors look for a return to personal responsibility, a culture built on respect for others, and decisionmakers who take responsibility for their decisions . Scheiderman prods the reader to &quot;end our romance with telegenic candidates who lack the qualifications for office. We should seek leaders of unimpeachable character who command respect, not quasi-celebrities who lack a sense of shame.....Identifying the qualities we seek in those who would guide us places us in a far better position to know which qualities we should use to guide ourselves.&quot; Well put as we choose between leaders to guide the nation to the next millenium"},{"Title":"Saving Face: America and the Politics of Shame","review":"Every culture should have to face its own shame. Unfortunately, shame is a variable concept according to the times, and the ability of the culture to properly identify what is shameful, who can be shameful, and the events that constitute a shameful event. Prior to the 1960's and 1970's nearly everything was &quot;shameful,&quot; in that women without gloves, and men without hats were considered shameful. Characterized much as the course of civil rights and the recognition of individual rights for humans, shame has always been a public evaluation, and measured by group politics so that propriety became the urge to resist, if not to rebel against. In a shameful culture, inhumane things were possible - lynchings, torture, animal sacrifices, etc. - even while upon the surface, propriety was worn like a badge of honor. The hypocrisy revealed in years hence, is that shame did not exist where it was private or unrevealed, adding to a culture where transparency became the idol rather than to embrace the boundaries of what constituted shame. Fortunately, America has moved beyond the narrowminded principles that so bound one to another that behavior and conduct, as well as dress, has been allowed a degree of freedom that embraces the ideas of difference so people need not examine each and every action, including speech, that brands them improper. While there are a few, generally job related, environments where rigid and shame-oriented cultures prevail, the concept of freedom has taken on greater significance recently as a privilege, if not a right, provided no laws are broken. This healthier environment that honors the individual works for all persons previously discriminated against, and offers breathing room for those who were not quite attuned to the proprieties of life who were interested in watching their every movement to be evaluated by the group or community. Neither healthy relationships nor flexibility in thinking were aided by former designs of acceptance, and many were condemned by society for that reason, many of whom were simply responding to their own unique social environment, or ethnic environment. While guilt still survives as an effort to restrain, it is fortunately much less likely to be the &quot;blackball&quot; it was years earlier, allowing everyone to breathe much easier. Coming through that period of gender bias, racial bias, ethnic bias, and even religious bias is not totally behind us, but great progress has been made to minimize the importance of those effects. We now are making inroads and efforts at behavior or conduct bias by everyone to overcome the tendency to typecast persons by superfluous events that are not considered within the mainstream but still cognizant of safety, and dignity in the things we do as humans, to each other, and the things we do to animals, or the environment, offering the new design of social freedom with responsibility but without social restraint, definite progress in the eyes of most people."},{"Title":"Frail Prisoners In Yuma Territorial Prison","review":"Someone must have been trying to fill up pages in this book.

I read this book because I heard that Farnol was an important influence on Jack Vance, a science fiction writer I like.This book concerns Barnabas, a young (about 22) son of an English innkeeper who inherits a substantial fortune. He decides to try to join London's fashionable world, and has some success for a while. He becomes friends with a Viscount, has a stumbling romance with a Lady, gets into tons of fistfights, does some horse racing. Eventually, it is discovered that he is only an innkeeper's son, though, and he loses his place in the fashionable world. I think you get the idea.The first part of the book went slowly, and so did the last part. The middle was more interesting to read. Overall, the book was well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Amateur Gentleman","review":"The young Barnabas has just inherited a vast sum of money from his uncle's death.

Entertaining and clean romance."},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"Steel Magic (1965) -- AKA Gray Magic -- is the first fantasy novel in the Magic series for older children. It is based loosely on the legends of King Arthur and Roland. It involves a magic gate to Avalon and quests to find three lost tokens of power.The Lowery children -- Greg, Eric, and Sara -- are staying at Tern Manor with their Uncle Mac while their father and mother are in Japan. Sara wins a picnic basket at the Firemen's Strawberry Festival and the children decide to put it to use. The next day they pack a picnic lunch and search for a lost lake. After winding and crawling through the underbrush, they find the lake and, on as island in the middle of it, they also discover a miniature castle.Although the doorway has been blocked with masonry, they are able to gain entrance by chipping away the mortar. Once within the castle, they are surrounded by a gray mist and, eventually, they find themselves somewhere else. After a brief exploration, they determine that they could not be on the island and are far from any place familiar. Opening the picnic backet, they start to eat while discussing the strange events, whereupon an unexpected guest shows up for lunch.The young man introduces himself as Huon of the Horn, the Warden of the West. He also tells them of the Warden of the East, Arthur. He informs them that they are in Avalon and tells them of the three lost objects: Excalibur, his Horn, and the ring of Merlin Ambrosius. Since they have been admitted through the Gate of the Fox, he explains, they must be in Avalon for a purpose. When questioned about his knife, he states that it is dwarf silver because the natives of Avalon cannot handle iron without harm.Huon takes them to Caer Siddi, where they meet Merlin. There they discover that evil has moved deep within Avalon and that the situation is very bad. Moreover, they are told that events in Avalon are mirrored in their own world. Merlin asks them to use their power of iron to retrieve the lost tokens and, when they agree, conducts them to a magic mirror, where they each take a stainless steel implement from the picnic basket and pass through to separate locales.This novel is a story of courage and perseverence, with each child facing and overcoming their special fears. It has brave people and magical animals, both good and evil, including a very wise fox.Recommended for all Norton fans and any child who loves animals, magic, and brave heros and heroines.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"Eric, Greg and Sara's dramatic entrance into the Avalon is somehow more romantic and believable than C.S. Lewis's wardrobe, yet it is of the same genre of literature. Huon of the Horn and his winged horses draw Eric, Greg and Sara in further, and the reader with them! Steel Magic would be classified as an &quot;intermediate&quot; novel, which is between easy reader and young adult. The three children rely on books that Eric and Greg have read for some of their insight into the strange world of Avalon, which incites in Sara the desire to read the tales of King Arthur and Merlin. Avalon has a cherished place in literature; your 3rd through 6th grader will find Steel Magic an enchanting introduction to this world!"},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"Starscape Books starts off a new reprint series, the \\"Magic Books\\" by the late Andre Norton, called that because each book has the word \\"Magic\\" in the title. The first in that series, \\"Steel Magic,\\" is a charming and imaginative book, though it's too fast-moving for its own good.While vacationing with their uncle, the three Lowery children go on a picnic, and decide to explore the local woodlands. They find a minature castle, creep past a wall -- and find themselves in an unfamiliar world. They promptly bump into the legendary Huon of the Horn, who tells them that they are in the magical land of Avalon. Merlin and Arthur are also there.And that's where the problems are. Three magical items have been stolen: Huon's horn, Merlin's ring, and Arthur's sword. Evidently Greg, Eric, and Sara are destined to find these three things. And so they set out on three separate quests, battling the dark forces on Avalon with only a steel knife, fork and spoon...Andre Norton spins up the feeling of a classic in \\"Steel Magic,\\" adding heft doses of myth, legend and classic Arthuriana to your basic good-vs-evil battle. It's got Norton's detailed writing, a unique setting, and a shriveling spin on the idea that certain metals (like steel) will destroy fey creatures. It's a brilliant, and rather funny, application.The only problem is that the book feels like abridged version of the realm thing. All the quests seem to take about half an hour; the kids barely arrive in Avalon before they are shuttled off to do battle. Avalon is bursting with potential for exploration, and we get a day trip that ends all too quickly.Despite this, the climactic clash between good and evil shows Norton's considerable skills at their best. Arthur and Merlin have very brief cameos, but much of the attention is on the admittedly charming Huon and the courageous lead trio, who are reminiscent of the plucky, stout-hearted kids in books like the Narnia series.While it feels like it's set on fast-forward, with no breathing breaks, \\"Steel Magic\\" is still a charming, enchanting little magical book, and at times shows Norton's skill at its peak."},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"Steel Magic was a favorite of mine growing up - I probably read it 3 or 4 times. I recently ordered it for my children, and I reread it before I passed it on to them. Norton's world retains a magic and wonder that should entrance just about any child. But when I was growing up we did not have Lord of the Rings, the Redwall series, Narnia (well, it was there, I just hadn't discovered it), or the many other well-developed fantasy worlds both in print and the visual media of today. So a worldly pre-teen might now find Steel Magic to be a little simple in comparison to the plethora of other fantasy stories now available.That is not to detract from Norton's fine storytelling ability. Buy this book for a nine-to-twelve year old who has not yet delved into Tolkien or Jacques. A fine tale."},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"I first read this book in 1974 as a young child. It is about three young children who come to this Arthurian world and meet Merlin. They are sent on (yep you guessed it!) separate quests to battle monsters, etc...

I just wish I had kept the copy I had as a child!"},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"This is the tipe of book that will fire the imagination of younger readers and have them clammering for smething else to read."},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"This is the second of the three novels collected in the omnibus THE MAGIC BOOKS (see), one of a set of at least six stand-alone novels with young, troubled protagonists who stumble across magical ways into other times or other worlds that give them a new perspective on their problems in the here-and-now. In some ways this story is more of a comfort read than the others, as the Lowrys (Greg, Sara, and Eric) have not had their personal world overturned by tragedy; they are just staying with an uncle at his half-wild estate while their parents are in Japan. Their problems have to do with phobias: Greg's fear of the dark, Sara's fear of insects, and Eric's fear of water.In fact, the story begins on an upbeat note: Sara has just won a prize for the first time, and she and her brothers break in the new picnic basket by exploring the estate with a packed lunch. Having a supply of ordinary food - and stainless-steel cutlery - becomes critical very quickly, as they stumble upon, and through, a gate to another world, where Arthur and Merlin still do battle with the forces of darkness. To find their way back home, the kids need to help the people of Avalon retrieve three stolen magical artifacts, which can only be won back by those who can handle 'cold iron' - and they need to do it before their supply of safe food runs out and they begin forming unbreakable ties to Avalon. They thus divide the food between them, and the three pieces of steel cutlery, and each pursues a separate artifact and faces his or her worst fear. (This gets interesting, especially since Eric is protected by a spoon rather than anything more glamorous.)Norton has used an Arthurian/semi-Arthurian setting in several other stories, including the full-length novels MERLIN'S MIRROR and HERE ABIDE MONSTERS, but none use the same setting or exactly the same characters. While Huon of the Horn appears in this story, the tone and style make STEEL MAGIC very, very different from Norton's book HUON OF THE HORN; if you enjoy STEEL MAGIC, that's not a reliable indicator as to whether you'll like HUON OF THE HORN."},{"Title":"Steel Magic","review":"Three kids find a secret entrance that leads them to Avalon.

Creeping through jungles, seeking the feared Japanese 'warrior', Pinney relates the thoughts and fears of his companions, from the pompous officers to the blood thirsty soldier and coward alike, he draws the characters with a simple, life giving ink and paints the steaming jungle backdrop with a magical brush.Fact and fiction interweave, I suspect, but the resulting story is of high class.Even if you are not interested in the subject, this is still a fantastic trilogy and one that at least every Australian should read!"},{"Title":"Signaller Johnston's Secret War: New Guinea 1943-45","review":"Pinney's account of jungle warfare in New Guinea and Borneo ranks among the finest war novels ever written. It's one minor drawback is that is is written in Australian English, and while the author does provide a glossary of slang terms, he omits common Aussie slang such as \\"whiteant\\". Any who have ever had the privilege of serving with Australians will immediately feel at home with the characters. These were a tougher bunch, having grown up in depression era Australia, but that old Digger self-sufficiency, distrust of authority, and biting humor shines through. Their speech will send hackles down the spines of the politically correct, but beneath the multi-hued skins of \\"boongs, murries, and burries\\" they see men much like themselves, locked in a struggle for survival, as much against nature as against the strange white and yellow armies fighting on their soil. Pinney's keen eye provides a myriad of details that move the reader from the blinding greens of the jungle, back to the routine of base camp, to a jungle pool covered with phosphorescent butterflies. He catches the wonder, the boredom, the fear, and the fatigue. Probably the best fictional account of war in the Pacific. If Mel Gibson ever wants to make an Australian World War II movie, this is it."},{"Title":"Signaller Johnston's Secret War: New Guinea 1943-45","review":"Peter Pinney kept a diary while fighting in New Guinea and Bouganville that would have got him court-martialed if it had been found.

Like being in an ambush with enemy soldiers just feet away. If they happened to see you, you are dead. Yet he does this repeatedly and survives.How does it feel to kill someone? Find out. How does it feel to lose a close friend? Find out. How do you fill the long periods of boredom between action? Find out. This is a truly amazing book."},{"Title":"Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory.

The young woman and little girl, displaced by the Civil War after the husband and father goes off to fight and die for the South, barely survive. That changes when the little girl, precocious at age three, has a clairvoyant dream about a Union soldier in the last year of the four-year war. The day after she tells her mother of the dream, minutely describing the soldier, he saves them from a raging storm and a firefight between Rebels and Confederates. The soldier comes to worship the child and love the woman, with equal passion; he accepts a dangerous assignment at war's end in exchange for the army's agreeing to send the child and mother to his farm in Meade County, Kentucky. The precious little girl, in Kentucky, has another clairvoyant dream about the soldier, on the other side of the war, that she adores. She dreams that he is shot in the head at the Battle of Girard on the Chattahoochee River where the river separates Columbus, Georgia, from Phenix City, Alabama. Telegrams from Columbus to Kentucky confirm the dream and the soldier is in a coma, not expected to live. The little girl has a third clairvoyant dream, when he comes out of the coma after four days."},{"Title":"Positive Power: 5 Keys to a Higher Leadership Profile","review":"Everyone interested in leadership, management, and basis of these two conceptions should hurry and get this book of Dr. Fisher!

'Reeling In The Years' is tabbed out for a 4 guitar arrangement. I believe the author was very thorough with this song and if you play it as written will get fantastic results. Alot of these songs you may consider copying for your own use so you can lay the pages out next to each other for better reading. I would take it one step further and completely write in the suggested rhythm fills and motifs so they're there on the page you're reading because it's alot to remember,(at least initially). Walter Becker did the guitar solo on 'Pretzel Logic' proving he was an amazing guitarist in his own right. Each solo is labeled with a name so you know who you're emulating if you play them. For guitar tones, well you're on your own for that. Larry Carlton gives a detailed description of his set-up on his 'Star Licks' dvd. The only problem for most of the rest of us is we don't have companies making custom amps and axes for our perusal and this is a big part of the Dan's or any other bigtime guitar act's signature sound.

Aside from reading paragraph after paragraph over and over again to figure out what a characters were saying, I could gather little from the plot for the exception that the book delved into the world of Nicholas Seafort, and his dealings with his runaway 12 yr old son. Lame ending to a great series of books. The author should get 10 lashings for it."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"I've read the first four in Feintuch's excellent Seafort saga and loved them all. Then I got this one and was bored to tears. It's very different to other's true but the formula of the rest of the series was fine with me.What you basically have is a dull, story full of teenage kids you do not care about, the world is badly described, the story just poor. I put the book down after 100 pages, maybe it gets better but frankly I don't care.Get back to space Feintuch."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Rumour has it that David Feintuch is writing another book in this series, but frankly I can't understand how he's going to manage it. Most sci-fi writers would have difficulty making a good job of Midshipman's Hope, but carrying it on through five books? How can he make a *hero* - who is mostly just an ordinary person at heart - consistently realistic, interesting and captivating to read about? Some readers aren't fond of Voices of Hope because it jumps from character to character, and is the first book in the series not to be seen through Nick Seafort's eyes, but I found it refreshing. It was also a better way to bring out the subtle changes in his personality, and how having a family has altered him. Set mostly in the slums of New York, the transpops are losing their water supply to more &quot;Uppie&quot; towers and are appealing to &quot;the Fisherman&quot; for help. Meanwhile, Nick's son Phillip runs away to find his friend who has disppeared into the depths of the city during the most dangerous time it has faced. And so it starts: every page has action in it, every page is interesting and richly written. (However, I advise you to read Challenger's Hope and Fisherman's Hope first, or you won't have a clue what the trannies are talking about). As with all the Seafort books, read, enjoy, and find the rest of the series post haste."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Having enjoyed reading the first novels in this series, I was VERY disappointed that I was unable to get through this one. The pace, the story, the moral? YUCK!"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"It is imperative for the Feintuch fan to read this book. The despair evident in Nick is manifested somewhat less in his son, Jared, who shares the family preoccupation with guilt. The quite possible social implications are enormously compelling and extraordinarily frightening. Not so much good vs. evil as the misled colliding. This book should appeal to the socially concerned as well as one just seeking a good read. Feintuch successfully makes you think!"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"This series was unique in its dark nature. I kept saying, &quot;Any normal human would be driven nuts by now&quot;. But I devoured the series. I couldn't put it down. The &quot;tolerence&quot; message was just a smidge heavy handed, giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. I bought in totally to the world and I was both comforted and disturbed. The series reminds me of early Hienlein in nature but rougher. I appreciate the challenges of the Navy more now, and that has influenced how I read other books about Navy characters. There is a story here, not just hack and slash."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Voices of Hope is completely different from all other Hope novels. But, the story is so detailed and exciting, you don't really care. The Trannie language could have been a bit more comprehensible."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Feintuch has crafted a very fine morality play. His maincharacter from all his other books, Nick Seafort, is at thecenter of this book, but is not an active participant untilthe very last. An insurrection in New York has broken out overwater rights. The street people have been targeted for extermination.They are being treated not as humans but as debrise thatmust be cleared before more buildings on Manhattan can bebuilt. The military has been ordered to slaughter these people.The question Feintuch asks is, &quot;If you are responsible foran Evil deed, should you take responsibility and try to fixthe problem you have caused?&quot; You can allow Evil to exist by manymeans: 1) By actively promoting Evil for your own gain,2) By actively participating in an Evil plan, 3) By acquiesingto an Evil deed while knowing it is Evil, 4) By trying todo Good and instead doing Evil, 5) By unknowingly doing an Evil deed6) By choosing to stand idly by and letting Evil to occur.Each of the characters in this book realize that they havedone Evil, and that only Nick Seafort can fix the problem. All thecharacters try to get him to act. Nick Seafort has walked throughHell for the good of other people and has been treatedbadly for it. He perceives that every action he takesmakes things MUCH worse.Will he take up the mantle of Hero once more, or will heallow an Evil deed to go forward? You are never sure whathis decision will be."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"This latest book by the Campbell 'best new author' is the culmination of a brilliant series. The only living author who prompts me to turn to the back page when I first pick up his books to check on the release date of his next book. David Feintuch is, without doubt, the future star of science fiction"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Despite what several reviews here say, this book is not difficult to read. The trannie language is not very complex, and easily understood once you get the hang of the slang. And I'm not even a native english speaker. In fact, once you get used to it, you get to like the way Pook and 'Changman' talk.The 'P.T. saves Jared' storyline doesn't seem very likely to me (thus 4 stars), but I think Feintuch manages to nicely portray the trannie culture he's invented. Even if there was nothing else to the book, that would justify reading it. But there's more.This is an &quot;exception&quot; in the series, because the story is not set among the navy, so Nick has no chance to demerit poor cadets, cane others, and shouting his famous 'belay that'. Instead, he's walking the streets of NY looking for his son while his son is busy growing up very fast among the trannies. Very refreshing. However, readers who like the series because it's about the navy, and space ships, and the chain of command, and quoting and interpreting regs, following orders, etc, will not enjoy this book, because that just doesn't surface here.The telling of the story from several different viewpoints kinda gets on your nerves sometimes, because the viewpoint always switches when something interesting is about to happen, and you have to wait to get back to the storyline, but it does work, and the book gets to be a page turner as the pacing increases.The ending is neat (and closer to the rest of the series), I liked it. I also liked the way P.T. was portrayed at the end, confronted with the possibility of his death; terrified, but not cowardly. It's not what you usually get. the usual solution is to have a hero who's not afraid. Here we have one that wets his pants.Worth reading! Get to know the trannie tribes!"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"This book was a major disappointment. As opposed to the other books in the series it was slow moving and had almost none of the classic 'space opera' scenes that defined the earlier books. I would encourage others who have read the earlier books not to waste their time on this one. I can only hope that his next book returns to the classic writing style of the first 4 books."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"In a series of entertaining and otherwise quality books David Feintuch's, Voices of Hope, far exceeds the previous four. His change in style from being entirely from Nick Seafort's perspective to the eyes of five different characters makes for an interesting twist. The previous four and their concentration on Captain Nicholas Seafort and his beloved Navy where enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but his change to following by and large the &quot;trannies&quot; was a welcome change. Who doesn't enjoy a good story about a bunch of half savage people living under the foot of a technologically advanced culture bent on destroying their way of life? All in all an exciting book that was difficult to put down until I was done."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"I started reading fairly young. I became a Sci-Fi fan early as a kid. Luckily my dad was also a reader who also enjoyed Sci-Fi as well. He's the one who let me borrow the first Seafort's hope book. Then last year when I got my Kindle White and I found more Seafort books at Amazon, I felt excited and knew I wanted to read the other Seafort stories."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Very different then the preceding 4 Seafort Sagas. This time the focus doesn't limit to only the Captain, The book ca stand alone and the reader will do fine without reading the first 4. I appreciated that this time the author developed more characters and this time the book goes beyond Seafort's excess of guilt.Some reviewers have complained about the use of the dialect of the urban poor but it's a natural outgrowth of a segregated society and far more a likely outcome in a society then a return to 18th-19th society military disipline.I was torn between a 4 and 5 star score because I really prefer my Si-Fi in space but the addition of Pook, Pedro,Rob, and Phillip to in depth characters besides jut focusing on Seafort tipped the balance. All of them were people of a type I have met. The book is a fine confrontation of how a society loses it moral compass and abuses the weakest among them pretending it's progress"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"After steaming through the first four novels in the series, I was apprehensive to go for this one; many reviewers here stated the book was no where near the quality of the first four, and I disagree. I'm no professional critic, but I loved reading this book and am excited for the next.This book is different from the rest of the series in that there are many characters narrating it. I enjoyed seeing everything happen from the various views of several characters, and while I preferred the regular English from the \\"Uppie\\" characters, the \\"trannie\\" language wasn't that bad for me to get through. I got used to it by the second time it showed up in the novel, and I could read it about as quickly as I could regular English.The story was very enjoyable. I loved the excitement that the middle and end of the novel provided, and the novel invoked emotional feelings for me at times--namely amusement and anger (not towards the novel itself, but at characters' actions). The beginning was a bit slow, but I feel it was necessary to get all the changes from previous novels and new characters introduced. The story picked up quickly, however. I would absolutely read the novel again, and I'm glad I chose to read it instead of stopping the series at book four. Looking forward to completing the series!"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Science fiction has the power to move us in ways no other genre can. It challenges our perception of reality and gives us glimpses of our future as it may be.David Feintuch has shown us that he is especially adept at such glimpses, using what we know about human nature and about ourselves to create a future that may very well happen. Feintuch's future is one in which the rich rule our world and the poor are forgotten.But also inherent to human nature is love. The tortured Nick Seafort despises himself, but loves God and mankind. He is incapable of forgetting the lost children of New York. He is incapable of watching passively as they are eliminated.It was hard diving into Voices of Hope. Seafort is such a compelling character that giving him up in favor of the five new &quot;voices&quot; is rather like abandoning a best friend. But it's worth it. Towards the end of the story, Captain Seafort emerges once more, and finaly, at long last, he is given the triumphant, glorious ending that he so deserves after four gruesomely sad books. In the end, those of us who stood by Nick will finaly find peace, even as his own soul is satisfied.The Hope series is not just a good read. It's an important set of works that deserves a great deal of attention. This is the first time since childhood that I have read a book with wonder and delight; drawn into the pages of a reality that may not have been my own, but was never-the-less all encompassing.Voices of Hope is a true masterpiece"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Stupe Uppie !

The motivation behind the basic premise of the main character was unbelieveable - and this made most of the subsequent actions silly.Unfortunately, it was also boring, as something like three quarters of the book was an introduction to the last quarter, which amounted to little more than a city riot.I also find books which hope for authenticity by imbuing their characters with EXTREMELY badly accented speeches very hard to read.Sorry, but the other books in this series must be better..."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"The book is written in the first person with a number different narrators. All these storytellers are supposed to be children (or young teens) but none of their voices is even remotely convincing. Feintuch spends much of this narrative outlining (sometimes using what I see as racist patois) how whiny, unreasonable, and downright stupid the characters are. Example: &quot;My voice what Changman call sullen .... My voice come in squeak. I bring it low, Redface.&quot; (p. 22) The story, compelling as some elements of it may be, cannot overcome Feintuch's sophomoric writing."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"The Seafort saga would not, by any stretch, be called a romp in the park by anyone. Nick himself is a hard character to warm up to, the future is not a pretty one and bad things happen to good people more often than not. However the previous 4 books were worthwhile reads. Not easy reads all the time, but worth the effort.This book though as my title proclaims is the weakest, and bleakest of the series. The next book Patriarch of Hope is much better and redeems this one. In this book Nick is removed from his strengths and is landbound as the elected leader of Earth, off and on. He is responsible for his own child as well as a child of a friend.We get to become all too familiar with the down and dirty slums, and down and dirty politics of the world and Nick's dysfunctional family. All the characters come across as unsympathetic and not likeable. Very little hope, very little redeeming about the plot. Drawn out, depressing and it is really hard to believe you've cared about Nick before, and harder to believe you'll care about his child in the next book.You could probably skip this one and not miss a beat by heading to Patriarch's Hope. If you must complete the series, be forewarned, this is hard work to get through and there isn't much payoff."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"After reading the series through Patriarch's Hope, I reflected back on them all, and this book is the one that stuck with me. It's been awhile since I read it, but, since it's the one that I remember most, I felt I should write a review.It is a completely original storyline. The introduction of new characters from Pook and Changman of the trannies, to Seafort's brilliant son, Phillip, really added new dimension to the series. I needed a break from Seafort and his guilt trip, this did it.Seaforts' son, Phillip, chases after his freind into the streets of NY. The only people living on the streets now are \\"trannies\\". These people are the forgotten throwaway's of a society that has since moved onward and upward into the skyscrapers and away from the city. Only heavily armed patrols ever venture into the streets, and then, only if absolutely necessary. Basically, the streets are left alone and ignored, and barred from the rest of the \\"civilized\\" world. Once there, your on your own...and don't expect any help, cuz it aint coming.It's into this world that Phillip now finds himself...and it's a fascinating world. There are gangs, and subcultures that have arisen out of survival instincts. How they exist together, and the society they have developed, knowing that no one gives a damn about them, is remarkable. There is ingenuity, violence, power grabs, treaties, bravery, and a surprisingly large amount of humor...probably not enough love, but, it is there also. It's a darwinian survival of the fittest society...and it's damned interesting.Phillips obvious genius, coupled with some handy martial arts instruction he had as a child, helps him survive in this environment. He meets up with Changman, a \\"neutral\\" trader, who trades with all the gangs equally...so as not to piss of any in particular. Changman is the real interesting character in this story. He has many secrets, and is one of the more multi-dimensional personalities in the HOPE series. Pook, is a child tranny, who Changman tries to look out for the best he can. There is no overt emotion or physical show of love and affection between the two. But, as much as the streets will allow, Changman tries to do his best for the kid.Pook is a great character also. A typical street \\"tough\\" wannabe. Just a child really, but, he wants to be feared and respected. His feelings and emotions can sometimes be hilarious as he's figuring out how to be tough, especially when this \\"uppie\\" kid just kicked his butt. He's as street smart a kid as your gonna find in any story tho...and you gotta love him.As for the \\"TRANNY LANGUAGE\\" everyone seems to be lambasting. I think that was as important to the story as any of the characters. The more I read it, the more I followed it. Along with Phillip and other \\"uppies.\\" We all learned it together. It is an extremely expressive slang. That matches the conditions of the trannies perfectly. They wouldn't be Trannies if they didn't have this language. The book wouldn't have been what it was without it. I had no problem following it, and the more I read, the more descriptive I found the language to be. It's just slang, after all, not French :-). Because of how well this language was used and flushed out, it seemed totally natural and part of this world. I think the TRANNY LANGUAGE is one of Feintuch's best acheivements as an author.There is a hilarious review using the Tranny language below mine, I think its completely understandable, and the more you read it, the less you have to think about it. I think they key, is to not think too much about it, and just lightly read over it, the meaning becomes clear. Almost every time POOK talks, using Tranny speak...I smile.Anyway, its a fascinating book, and the best in the series, imho. Those that didn't like it, seemed to have a common problem with it...the Tranny language. I didn't have that problem and thought it was one of the best aspects of the book.I think this could be a stand alone book. It's been over a year since I read it...but, its so different, and the characters are almost all new, you probably don't need to read the previous Hope books to enjoy it. It's amazing I remember as much of it as I do. I have difficulty remembering the TITLES of the other books in the series, let alone any story line. Yes, I recommend this one.SF"},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"Voices of Hope is quite different from the other books in the Seafort series. It is told from several points of view, including that of Nick's son Philip, Adam Tenere's son Jared, and two members of the transpop culture represented in earlier books by Eddie and Annie. While the differing narratives are occasionally interesting, I found none of them as compelling as Nicholas Seafort's narratives in the other novels. Furthermore, the transpop chapters are written in a dialect I found almost unreadable. There is more violence in this book than in the others, and the transpop setting of most of the novel is bleak and disturbing. This story is gloomy even for a Seafort novel! I don't recommend it. You can skip it and go on to the next book without confusion."},{"Title":"Voices of Hope","review":"What some of the reviewers here do not realize is that this book is not the same as the other four books about Seafort.

S. Barnes and Co. printing of 1851, the last printing before Davies introduced a new edition that same year. I find blank pages at page 36, which would contain the first three propositions of Book II (a minor but real loss), and at the back of the book there are three pages missing that would contain tables of logarithmic sines and tangents for 1 degree, for 43 degrees, and for 45 degrees.The cover design of the book is as shown in the amazon photos. The print quality is equivalent to that of AMS Chelsea books. It is produced via \\"generation of a scan of the original\\" and there is no indication of previous ownership of the original text, such as library stamps or extraneous markings of any kind. It is as good a paperback as any other you might purchase, being glued, not sewn.Forgotten Books has the author on the cover as A. M. Legendre. This is not exactly inappropriate, as explained below. Charles Davies himself has printed on the title page: \\"Translated from the French of A. M. Legendre, By David Brewster, LL. D.\\" The text was \\"revised and adapted\\" by Davies, not actually composed anew.I much prefer reading actual physical books to reading digital copies on a computer screen, so I plan to purchase more reprints of books that interest me. Forgotten Books is one reprint publisher I now trust (despite the four missing pages in Davies, it is still an excellent value), and I intend to purchase from them again.Now on to Charles Davies and his Elements of Geometry.A no-doubt valuable reference, which I haven't seen, is: Amy K. Ackerberg-Hastings, Mathematics is a Gentlemans Art: Analysis and Synthesis in American College Geometry Teaching, 1790-1840, Ph.D. dissertation, Iowa State University, 2000. There is an excerpt from this online, which is devoted to Davies: \\"Chapter Five. Two Circles Will Touch Each Other Internally: Charles Davies at the Art and Business of Teaching Geometry.\\"Charles Davies taught at West Point Military Academy from 1823 to 1837, so researching him in relation to West Point may help. See, for example, the article from the Mathematical Association of America: \\"Mathematics Education at West Point: The First Hundred Years\\", by V. Frederick Rickey and Amy Shell-Gellasch.Ackerberg-Hastings' excerpt, along with pdf copies of Davies' books, shows that the main revision years of Davies' Elements of Geometry were 1828, 1834, 1851, 1857, 1862, and posthumously in 1885 edited by J. Howard Van Amringe incorporating revisions left by Davies in 1875. Ackerberg-Hastings claims 1882 for the posthumous edition, but I find it only with a preface dated 1885 by Van Amringe, although the copyright page lists 1862, 1882, 1885. Since 1862 was, what I'll call, the 5th edition, perhaps the 1882 edition was merely a reprint of that. Van Amringe's preface of 1885 gives the impression that it marks the first newly revised publication of Davies book since his death in 1876.V. Frederick Rickey and Amy Shell-Gellasch (mentioned above) write that: \\"The 1828 text, Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry, was his most popular book. In the period 1828-1895 it appeared in 33 editions/printings and some 300,000 copies.\\" The book was, in fact, originally a translation and edited version of Legendre's &Eacute;l&eacute;ments de G&eacute;om&eacute;trie of 1794. See the Ackerberg-Hastings excerpt for details. Of the 1834 edition (the edition reprinted by Forgotten Books), she writes:\\"Davies became a more significant editor with the 1834 printing of Elements of Geometry andTrigonometry. He substituted in material from Edinburgh Encyclopaedia in Book V and from Encyclopaedia Metropolitana in Book II [...]. Davies added eight axioms, several from Playfair's Elements or Simson's The Elements of Euclid: six statements on the relationships between equals and unequals, \\"Through the same point, only one straight line can be drawn which shall be parallel to a given line,\\" and \\"All right angles are equal to each other,\\" eliminating the first proposition from Carlyle's translation, which proved right angles are equal. Repeatedly, Davies elaborated on the reasoning process used to arrive at conclusions within proofs or in additional scholia. He also rearranged a very few definitions and propositions in the earlier books.\\"The editions have interesting differences. The edition of 1851 seems to have been an attempt to simplify the text, and I prefer the 1834 edition over it. But the later editions of 1857, 1862, and 1885 return to the direction of 1834, while being true revisions and stylistic improvements. The trigonometry of the 1834 edition is presumably from Legendre. Starting with the edition of 1857, the trigonometry section expands considerably, and Davies tells us that it was written by \\"Professor Church of the Military Academy, for publication as a separate work; but, under the impression that it would be more useful as a component part of a regular course, he generously offered it as a substitute for the Trigonometry of the previous Editions.\\"Davies distinguishes between axioms and postulates starting with the 1857 edition. An axiom \\"is a self-evident truth\\" and a postulate \\"is a self-evident problem.\\" So his postulates include such statements such as: \\"Let it be granted, that a straight line may be drawn from one point to another point.\\" His axioms include statements that Euclid considers postulates, such as: \\"All right angles are equal to each other.\\" Davies lists what Euclid would call \\"common notions\\" under his axioms. So for Davies, it is an axiom that \\"Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.\\" What is odd is that Davies lists no postulates, in the meaning of his 1857 edition, in his editions prior to 1857. So he doesn't make explicit prior to 1857 that, for example, a straight line can be drawn from one point to another.[Edit: Axiom 11 states that \\"From one point to another only one straight line can be drawn.\\" This axiom also occurs in the 1857 edition, where in the list of postulates he then asserts the possibility of drawing a straight line from one point to another. What is missing in 1834 are postulates granting this and other kinds of possibilities, such as a straight line bisecting a given angle or drawing a perpendicular from a point to a line. It is of interest to compare this with Euclid. To give one instance: Euclid I.9 derives the bisection of a rectilineal angle; Davies 1857 lists it as a postulate; Davies 1834 does neither.]Davies alters his definition of straight line over the course of his editions. In 1828 and 1834 he defines a straight line as being \\"the shortest distance from one point to another.\\" Accounting for differences in translator's word-choice, this is probably Legendre's definition, if Farrar, in his 1825 translation of &Eacute;l&eacute;ments de G&eacute;om&eacute;trie (a translation which Davies isn't using as his base text) is fairly true to Legendre's meaning when he writes: \\"A straight line or right line is the shortest way from one point to another.\\" In 1851 Davies says \\"a straight line is one which lies in the same direction between any two of its points.\\" Having altered the definition of straight line, in this edition he adds the axiom: \\"A straight line is the shortest distance between two points.\\" In 1857 he defines a straight line as \\"one which lies in the same direction at every point.\\" The corresponding axiom becomes: \\"A straight line measures the shortest distance between two points.\\" I don't have current access to the 1862 edition. In the 1885 edition, \\"a straight line is one that doesn't change its direction at any point.\\" The corresponding axiom states: \\"The shortest distance from one point to another is measured on the straight line which joins them.\\"For an early use of direction in defining a straight line, see James Hayward 1829, Elements of Geometry upon the Inductive Method, where he defines a straight line as being \\"one which has the same direction throughout its whole extent.\\" Hayward was Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard University. His text does not employ axioms. This was followed in 1837 by Benjamin Peirce, also of Harvard, in An Elementary Treatise on Plane and Solid Geometry, defining a straight line as being \\"one, the direction of which is the same throughout.\\" Peirce does not mention Hayward (although as a student at Harvard from 1825 to 1829 he probably studied under him) and he speaks of his own use of direction as an undefined notion as an \\"innovation\\". Peirce uses the axiom: \\"A straight line is the shortest way from one point to another.\\"Another interesting comparison among Davies' editions involves the definitions of geometry, point, and surface. For brevity, I'll compare the 1834 and 1857 editions only. In 1834, geometry is defined as \\"the science which has for its object the measurement of extension. Extension has three dimensions, length, breadth, and height or thickness.\\" He defines a point in relation to a line. He says: \\"A line is length without breadth or thickness. The extremities of a line are called points: a point, therefore, has neither length, breadth, nor thickness, but position only.\\" This definition of point binds points to lines, with his definition of straight line being \\"the shortest distance from one point to another\\" (i.e. from one extremity of a line to another). Lines, then, apparently, share extremities. (Euclid, after defining a point as \\"that which has no part\\", later says: \\"The extremities of a line are points.\\" Saying that extremities are points is not to say that all points are extremities. Davies, however, gives no independent meaning beyond a point being an extremity of a line.)Davies does not later say in 1834 of a surface that it is composed of points, but only that a surface \\"is that which has length and breadth, without height or thickness\\" and that \\"a plane is a surface, in which, if two points be assumed at pleasure, and connected by a straight line, that line will lie wholly in the surface.\\" This tells us that a plane is flat, the surface analogue of being straight. (Compare Euclid: \\"A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.\\" I take this as meaning that no straight line in a plane extends beyond or outside the surface.)In 1857, Davies has definitions preliminary to his definition of geometry. He writes: \\"Space extends indefinitely in every direction. A Volume is a limited portion of space. It has three dimensions: length, breadth, and height or thickness. A Magnitude is anything that can be measured. A geometrical magnitude is a magnitude which possess one or more of the attributes of a volume. Geometry is the science which treats of the properties and relations of the geometrical magnitudes.\\"He then gives us the definition of point: \\"A Point is that which has position, but not magnitude.\\" Recall that in this edition he defines a straight line as being \\"one which lies in the same direction at every point.\\" As in 1834, this binds the definition of a straight line (not line in general) to the definition of a point, although in a different way than in 1834. An axiom tells us: \\"A straight line measures the shortest distance between two points.\\" Distance has no independent definition. Of a surface, he gives the definition: \\"A Surface is that which has length and breadth, without thickness. Surfaces are of two kinds, Plane and Curved.\\" He defines a plane surface: \\"A Plane is a surface, such, that if any two of its points be joined by a straight line, that line will lie wholly in the surface.\\"Because in 1857 he has defined points independently of lines, this definition of a plane, almost the same as in 1834, now suggests that points are an integral component of a plane. A surface, we might imagine, is comprised of points. The relation of a line to a surface isn't made explicit, but it appears that lines have an intimate relation to surfaces, since a line may have direction, and the \\"broken line\\" and \\"curved line\\" are defined also in terms of direction in this edition. Direction (an undefined notion) only makes (intuitive) sense in relation to length and breadth together (i.e. two dimensions), which a surface, but not a line, has.A curved line, being one \\"which changes its direction at every point\\" may certainly lie within a plane if it has the proper orientation, since a line has neither height nor breadth, but there is no indication of how lines, straight or curved, lie within a curved surface (what they look like), because a curved surface is defined simply as \\"a surface which is neither a plane nor composed of planes\\"; nor is there any indication what the shortest distance between points would be in a curved surface (although it would seem, by the axiom, to be a \\"straight line\\", a line which hasn't \\"changed direction\\" between those points). So what would \\"change of direction\\" mean in a curved surface, according to these definitions and the axiom? Presumably the same thing it means on a plane surface.In the introduction to the 1857 edition, we are corrected on some of these assumptions about the relations among points, lines, and surfaces:\\"A Volume being a limited portion of space, is necessarily divided from the indefinite space which surrounds it: that which so divides it, is called a Surface. Now, since that which bounds a volume is no part of the volume itself, if follows, that a surface has but two dimensions, length and breadth.\\"If we consider a limited portion of a surface, then that which separates such portion from the other parts of the surface, is called a Line. This mark of division forms no part of the surface which it separates: hence, a line has length only, without breadth or thickness.\\"If we regard a limited portion of a line, that which separates such a portion from the part beyond, at either extremity, is called a Point. But this mark of division forms no part of the line itself: hence a point has neither length, breadth, nor thickness, but place, or position, only.\\"Although we use the term Volume to denote a given portion of space, the term surface to denote the boundary of a volume, the term line to denote the boundary of a surface, and the term point to designate the limit of a line, still, we may employ either of these terms, in an abstract sense, without any reference to the others.\\"So a point, a line, and a surface are boundaries only. They are not components of space. A line and a surface are not composed of points. Points have no magnitude, and lines and surfaces do. They are all three, each within their dimensional limitations, boundaries within space, which \\"extends indefinitely in every direction\\", direction remaining undefined. (It seems that a surface and line, then, are not comprised of points of position, that extension or magnitude is not an arrangement of localities of position.) These remarks from the introduction of 1857 are absent from the edition of 1885.For those curious about the parallel axiom, in 1834 it's given as: \\"Through the same point, only one straight line can be drawn which shall be parallel to a given line.\\" Parallel lines are defined as: \\"Two lines are said to be parallel, when being situated in the same plane, they cannot meet, how far soever, either way, both of them be produced.\\" In 1857 is added the additional remark: \\"They then have the same direction.\\" The axiom in 1857 is the same as in 1834.[Edit: The edition of 1828 follows Legendre's text in having no axiom concerned with parallel lines. Legendre believed he had proven such an axiom as a theorem.]Charles Davies' Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry, known also simply as Davies' Legendre, was a popular and influential textbook in the United States during the 19th century. Looking into any one of his several editions is to see how geometry was taught in the past. This reprint of the 1834 edition is well worth the small expense to acquire it."},{"Title":"Petrarch (Past Masters)","review":"Petrarch is a central figure in the story of Western Culture. His turning to ancient literature, his scholarship, textual analysis and literary works were a stepping stone to the Renaissance. His own literary projects vast and ambitious were perhaps less important than the interest he created in both the revival of ancient learning, and the turning to Nature as source for literary inspiration. His vast literary projects in which he intended to contend and in some way outdo his great masters, Cicero , Vergil and on the Christian side Augustine fell by and large flat. What remains of his that is somewhat read today is the Sonnets . In the biography Mann shows how for Petrarch the writing of them too was as much and even more a project of his literary ambition than of his life- love. Petrarch is a great scholar whose vast worlds of interests, and tremendously energetic mind inspired the generations who came after.

Forrest. I thought the battle details were about right so as to instruct on what went on and to give insight to Forrest's great ability, but not so much as to bog down a reader who has not read much about warfare. I thought Wills was fair concerning the incident at Ft Pillow--he did not place the blame at Forrest's feet, but was sure that Forrest was not in total control of his men. I, personally, would liked to have had more detail about Forrest's deeds after the War Between the States. Some of Wills' comments seem to be a little vague, and at times he seemed to be jumping sides as to Forrest's involvement with the KKK. Overall, I did learn about this interesting man and am glad that I read this book. It was a good starting place for continued reading on General N.B. Forrest."},{"Title":"The Confederacy's Greatest Cavalryman: Nathan Bedford Forrest (Modern War Studies)","review":"What I like about Wills book, besides the bio, is that it addresses why Forrest was often not in the main theater of operations during the crucial times of 1864. Forrest is well defined as a frontier planter whose strong belief in honor combined with an explosive action oriented temperament made him a ferocious opponent yet he was difficult as a subordinate except under the right conditions. In the case of the latter, Forrest literally offers to slap Braxton Bragg for his lack of action after Chickamauga and only fails to do so because in his estimation, Bragg was not a man thus not worthy of the challenge. Wills does an excellent compact bio of Forrest capturing the early life and his rise to success as a slave trader and planter to a private in the Confederate service to the immediate promotion of Colonel and on. All the daring raids are captured, aided by maps but aside from Shiloh and Chickamauga, the only truly large operation Forrest was involved with was Hood's march to Nashville where the inexplicable Spring Hill disaster is laid at Forrest's feet unfairly when Hood had responsibility of creating a sufficient force to stop Schofield's escape. The tremendous work ethic combined with his fearlessness and temper is described throughout the book including Forrest's post war life and business. Forrest does amazingly well defending his Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama sector with a relative small force culminating in his great victory at Brices Crossroads. Wills includes Forrest's post war career with an example of Forrest's feared temper by describing a railroad meeting where one of Forrest's engineers starts the discussion with a loaded pistol on the table in case the company President, Forrest, intended a violent interruption. Although not captured in gross detail, Forrest's role at the infamous Fort Pillow is described in sufficient detail along with Forrest's post war role in the Ku Klux Klan. The role of the Klan is described as an attempt to maintain a retaliatory police force against over stepping radicals and to force former slaves into roles as cheap labor and as a channeled political force obviously through violence if deemed necessary. The association with Forrest seems quite clear but murky before congress. One thing is very clear in this bio, if Forrest was involved, he had to lead the action, or he otherwise was not interested. A most feared adversary, inventive, unpredictable and incredibly daring leading his men wherever he wanted them to go. As Wills points out, how unfortunate he rarely had a suitable commander to follow in larger campaigns and he was not used effectively during Sherman's initial march to Atlanta. If he was, Sherman would not have got there until at last 1865. The book is approximately 381 pages, maps and pictures and another 100 pages of notes and index. The book is endorsed by the late Emory M. Thomas (The Last cavalier), Dr. James I. Robertson, Jr. (Stonewall Jackson: The Man, the Soldier, the Legend) and William C. Davis (The Lost Cause)."},{"Title":"The Confederacy's Greatest Cavalryman: Nathan Bedford Forrest (Modern War Studies)","review":"The Confederacy's Greatest Cavalryman : Nathan Bedford Forrest (Modern War Studies) by Brian Steel Wills is a fine biography of perhaps the most complicated and interesting leader of the Civil War. In describing Forrest it is difficult, if not impossible, to remain neutral. For those that love or hate him there is plenty of ammunition. However, Wills does a better than anticipated job taking the neutral course.For those that view Forrest as the reincarnation of the Devil, there is plenty of evidence, and Wills covers most of it. Forrest was a crude, ruffian slave trader who would not think twice of killing a man who he believed showed him disrespect. As Willis writes, he was responsible for the massacre of Union troops at Fort Pillow. As a General he was brilliant when in independent command, but did not do well when working under someone elses command or part of a larger team. This failure limited his ability to have a greater impact on the course of the War. His failure to work with other Generals who he believed were inferior was part of the reason that the Union Army was able to escape destruction at Spring Hill.On the other hand, Forrest was a brilliant tactician and a real leader of men. From leading his troops out of the encirclement at Fort Donaldson to his brilliant victory at Bryce Creek, Forrest was a fighter and a leader. Furthermore, if Hood had listened to Forrest after Spring Hill, and allowed Forrest to out flank the Union troops at Franklin, the battle of Franklin may have been a Confederate victory rather than a disaster.Willis deftly moves between the several General Forrests. He seems not to have an agenda, giving the good with the bad. At least until the Civil War ends. While Wills does describe Forrest's contribution to the founding and growth of the Ku Klux Klan, he seems to hold his punches. However, that is a slight criticism. Al in all, this is a good book about one of the most interesting personalities in the Civil War."},{"Title":"The Confederacy's Greatest Cavalryman: Nathan Bedford Forrest (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is the definative biography of Nathan Bedford Forrest.

Here is his parody of my review: \\"Omitted by sources unknown\\"Poor woman who daydreams impossible dreams. Maybe all Southern women are like that? Expecting a good report of the Confederacy, this first novel was a disappointment. The cover of a vision of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the great General, who periodically \\"visits\\" her as she sits at the kitchen table making out her grocery list.

Tennessee, in a grand house with a separate kitchen where slaves prepare the family's meals. It means nothing to him in Sally's opinion. He carefully embellishes this most unusual story where nothing is as it seems. Mrs. Hollingsworth, age 50, had many illusions and delusions about men and other useless objects, but the general is the only one to be seen by others. The cover drawing is awfully good in its detail all in his regalia. Too bad you can't see it. The book is on the market and expensive on Amazon. Guess that's why they are denying they even have the title (at least six). Get the book for the cover, read the crazy things a lazy woman wants in her life and write your own review. That will be justice for all who write reviews for this Seattle company which has no mailing address or email to report their own harrassment. In a circutous route, the story written quite simply jumped from, the daydream to provocative nonsense. It could have been written by Zach, also a Floridian teacher who could write about gods and classical personages as a child. Alas, he did not have to manufacture a fantasy world; he created his at the age of four or five. History is made out of accidents and coincidences.There is ambience but that's about all in this false history like the local historian bases his on 'Suttree', a fictional novel. Because of that, I quit reading Metro Pulse several months ago. In the movie, Eragon, this quote describes this book: \\"I'm not a legend. People believe just about anything\\" especially in print. Never give up on hope, faith and charity. Mrs. Hollingsworth needs all the help she can get, even from that vision of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a real Southern gentleman.

Many times my reaction to the decisions the hero and heroine made was, &quot;No one could be that stupid.&quot; I love a well-written romance with characters that don't manufacture their own angst from vapor. Unfortunately, by the time I made it through these 300 pages, I was bored. Turning my boredom into pseudo-horror was the final battle, purportedly between good and evil. It struck me that the author had no idea how to visualize, write about (and possibly believe in) a battle sequence. Barney was there in spirit if not his big purple self. I recommend the book as a very light read for people who multi-task. Read while you cook, clean and solve world hunger.

The story was cute, the characters were fun. While I agree with other reviewers, the underlining was weird and would have been better served as italics, it wasn't so bad once I got used to it. But, I feel like if the biggest concern is some underlined words and sentences then that's not much of a concern to me. Personally, my biggest complaint was that the book was too short. Not that the story line needed more. Just that I wanted more. That isn't much of a complaint, though, is it?

I was engrossed literally by page 1 and it was fantastic from beginning to end. I loved Megan, Kenric, Rionnon, heck I loved every character in this devine novel all the way down to Lancelot! The chemistry between hero and heroine was to die for....loved the love scenes but to be brutally honest would have loved to have had more of those LOL. It was wonderful all the way around and no stone was left unturned nor any answers left up in the air as so many novels do.I have only 3 small personal gripes with this novel which are:1) The CONSTANT use of the term \\"war horse\\" personally I internally screamed my frustration after the first 10 times it was mentioned..... in my preferance I would say 2 times is more than enough to have informed me that this was such a horse.... the simple use of \\"horse\\" after the initial description would have been enough for ME as I did not need a constant reminder that Lancelot was a \\"war horse\\" it just annoyed me.2) The editing of paragraphs in this book was a little difficult in means of ease of reading for me, and again it may be that it was due to me reading this off of my Android and maybe the actual book itself read easier and more fluid, I don't know as this was the first ebook I have read where I had this problem.3) Last thing that bothered me was the error in time.... if I am not mistaken, there was mention in the beginning of the book that it was 2010, then she goes back to 1072 BUT keeps saying she comes from 900 years in the future which adds up to 1972.... and then she goes back into the future to 2008?? The math was all wrong in so many ways so again the editing on this book was not up to par.Just a few details that really bothered me as a reader, maybe I am being too picky but again, just my 2 cents! Other than that I give this a huge thumbs up and look forward to more!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I will have to admit that curiosity is the prime reason for reading this book. The back cover blurb doesn't give much by way of details of the actual storyline, just that the main character feels like she is being eaten. I couldn't stop myself from reading this book after reading that! However, the story wasn't exactly what I was expecting, although it was still pretty good.Set in Canada in the late 1960s, the women's role in life is slowly trying to break free from the 50s television version of the housewife that vacuums in pearls and heels. Marian, a recent college graduate, considers herself a pretty independent woman. Even her relationship with her boyfriend, Peter, doesn't get in the way of her independence. She lives on her own with her roommate and best friend, Ainsley, and she makes her own living as copywriter for a survey service. But when, out of the blue, Peter proposes marriage, strange things start happening. Marian begins to feel consumed with making plans, quitting her job, moving in with Peter, and settling down for her role as housewife. All of a sudden she can't eat certain things and she has strange panic attacks that come from nowhere. Her freedom is being threatened, but Marian sees no way out. Or is there?While Marian's story is the core of this novel, the host of supporting characters intrigued me the most. Ainsley decides she wants to have a baby and begins her search to find the lucky man to help her out. Marian's friend, Clara, and her husband, Joe, provide a stunning example of what married/family life will be like (and not always in a good way). Then there's Duncan, a man who answers the door when Marian is out doing surveys, who has his own issues. All of these storylines are full of feminist symbolism, and I believe it is important to know this before you read the book. It will definitely help you understand the novel more clearly.I'm a new Atwood fan, having read and loved The Handmaid's Tale just a month ago. And while The Edible Woman is not as exhilarating or fascinating like Handmaid, I still found it to be very well-written with an interesting storyline, despite its heavy symbolism that mostly went over my head (I'm not too good at picking that stuff out!). I have two other Atwood books on my shelf and I'm looking forward to reading them. I believe that imagination and originality is Atwood's forte, and I have high hopes that the rest of her novels will provide a healthy dose."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This is only the third Margaret Atwood novel I have read--having picked them all up at various flea markets and discount stores on a whim. I am a woman who usually does not identify with female authors, most of whom seem too aware of being &quot;female authors&quot; to tell a straightforward story without feminist propaganda. _The Edible Woman_, however, really hit me on a visceral level. Marian is the same age as I and has a similar perspective. She has a kitchen sink with molding dishes and a refrigerator whose innards seem to be growing. She has a college education and a job that she has no emotional attachement to, in fact she is horrified when forced to sign on to a retirement package, feeling tied to forever to an apathetic existence. She occasionally feels invisible when in a room with others, particularly it seems around her fiancee, at one point sliding between a bed and a wall while her friends quaff gin and play with camera equipment, never noticing she is gone until she is squashed under the bed as one of them sits down. She seems to be wandering through life without a purpose and clings onto the idea of being a wife by becoming almost accidentally engaged to an &quot;ideal&quot; man. Soon after this she finds herself slowly being nauseated by different sorts of food.If the young ladies in this book didn't dress up so much and drink alcohol and smoke while pregnant it would seem very much a generation X novel! Starring apathetic protagonists Marian and Duncan, who both manage to be vivid characters in spite of the fact that they seem to spend most of their time just floating through life. A large part of the novel's strength is its well rounded secondary characters from Ainsley, Marian's single connivingly procreating room-mate, to Clara a somewhat disgruntled mother, to Duncan's slightly deranged grad-school room-mates.This was a very fun book filled with characters I can imagine meeting among my own group of friends."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I've got a few Atwood books and this is by far the oldest one, so if it's not her writing debut (as opposed to poetry, which I think she did as well) it's pretty close and I have to say that I was pretty impressed with how strong her narrative voice was and how confident the book feels. Reading it you get a sense that the author knows exactly what she's doing and how to go about it. That sense makes the book that much more fun to read, even if it's not going to be recognized as one of her absolute masterpieces. The story concerns a woman named Marian, presumably in her mid-twenties, who after getting engaged starts to lose her desire to eat most kinds of food. But even that description is a tad misleading because the eating aspect doesn't even come into play until almost halfway through the book. Indeed those looking for a feminist version of &quot;Thinner&quot; should probably go the other way right now. Instead it's an examination of a woman's role in both society and marriage and that gives the story more weight, balancing the often silly and humorous situations Marian finds herself in. It's definitely the lightest book I've read by Atwood, it's hard to believe this is the same woman who did the ultra-depressing Life Before Man. But the main focus isn't even on Marian's quasi-eating disorder but on her interactions with her fiancee, her roommate (the subplot with her wanting a baby is absolutely hilarious in a darkly absurd way) and an odd graduate student she meets while out doing a survey for her job. That graduate student and his monologues was my favorite part of the chapter and probably represents Atwood's poke at the academic world, but definitely shows off her gift for words. But be on the look out for metaphors, just about everything means something else it seems, even the switch from first to third person struck me as odd until I realized even that represented something. In the end the metaphors get stretched a bit too far and the only truly silly moment is right at the end. But it's immensely enjoyable for an Atwood novel and one of the few that you'll find yourself laughing more than feeling glad you aren't the characters."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"The best feature of this book is its ability to enthrall. Clearly, Margaret Atwood's style in this novel is still green, as she wrote this book when she was only about 24, but I think that it contributed to my enjoyment of this book. While it is slightly reminiscent of some of her later fiction, it differs significantly in the narrational flow, allowing the reader to be gently assimilated into the message of the book without feeling as if he or she should always be &quot;on the lookout&quot; for pithy hidden messages. Some may claim that this book is superficial and a run-of-the-mill attempt at distinctive women's lib literature, but this is not so. It is simply subtle insight into human nature in all aspects--including the aspects of both women AND men. Also be reminded that Atwood actually wrote the book before the brunt of the women's lib movement, but unfortunately, it was not published until 1970, marking it as correlative to the movement. I highly recommend this book, especially, in fact, for those who are dissatisfied with Atwood's prose style and writing techniques. Perhaps this book will equalize your perception of her. Although I enjoy Atwood across the board, this book is one of the most refreshing and engrossing reads I've encountered."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I'd give this 3.5 stars, for the record...I was pleasantly surprised by this book, especially after reading the blurb which loudly declared &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; to be a book about wild sex. Luckily it actually turned out to have more substance than that: if anything, the sex scenes are so low-key as to be nonexistent. Instead the focus is upon the psychological aspects of Marian's relationships with her fiancee and with Duncan, and most of all upon the way she views herself. While on the surface &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; can be viewed as a feminist rant against marriage and commitment, this would be in my opinion a reductive perspective to take. &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; is primarily the charting of one woman's loss of identity as she attempts to mold herself to conform to the expectations of others.Despite the serious and even dark undercurrents, this is a light, fun read. The characters are almost caricatures, even the main character, saying and doing things that no one in their right minds would ever do in real life. Fortunately this cartoonish treatment of the characters works in the novel's favor: it makes Marian's strange disorder more believable, and ultimately the message of the book being carried through in such a manner makes it--dare I say--more palatable. Atwood may have an axe to grind, but she does it with such delicate strokes that one can only appreciate the elegant subtlety she employs.Atwood's prose is lucid and witty, and she takes some playful jabs at academia that are truly hilarious. The assembled cast of characters, even while they are too zany to be real, are also vastly entertaining. This book is not incredibly deep or substantial; though it does deal with some complex themes, it is in the end exactly as it comes across on the surface: a fun read. I probably wouldn't read it again, but I'm glad to have read it once."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I thought I had lost my faith in 20th century writing, but this novel proved just how well a feminist can write. The book isn't even preachy, in fact, it reminds me of a story by Charlotte Gilman Perkins called &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;. It's almost like both characters are literally being eaten, or consumed, by male driven society. Rich in metaphors, the novel illustrates how women can regain control of their lives, not necessarily through the bounds of matrimony, but through the rejection of it. Marian does not seem to have a life her own, but follows paths shaped by other's expectations of her as a woman. I really enjoyed the end of the book, it seemed fitting and makes the book a whole metaphor for the moral crisis that Marian goes through, particularly when her mind is rebelling from the society that influences her daily life. In other words, read this book."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago. I was working on a master's degree in English in Detroit and had just met the man that I would marry. Sigh! How I wish that I had listened more carefully to Atwood. I would have run from that! The Edible Woman is broadly humorous -- the heroine works for Seymour Surveys -- and very much a girls night out. Funny, perhaps slightly dated, it is a warning to listen to your inner voice. I seldom read more than one or two books by an author. The next book from Atwood's pen that I read, Surfacing, turned me off to her for many years. However, during that time, her reputation as a writer grew. When I finally picked her up again, I was glad I did. Atwood has grown into one of the major voices in 20th century literature and will, most likely, continue to be heard into the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I'm a generation (or two?) removed from this book (a single woman having a career in the late 1960's), so I had some trouble relating to the main character's struggles. At times, I wasn't sure if Atwood was telling a matter-of-fact tale or trying to make a feminist point. Marian loses her ability to eat as she faces a decision about whether to stay with a dependable man or date the quirky anti-establishment freethinker she met at random. The female characters all seemed weak and lacking motivation or direction, so I'm definitely missing something if this is supposed to be fun and ironic. I think this can be a tough novel for people so far removed from the late 1960's to read and understand. I wish I was able to relate, because I admire Atwood as an author, but I just couldn't. Definitely try some of her other work, like The Robber Bride or The Handmaid's Tale, if you are interested in experiencing the more accessible material."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"It was ok, but I missed a lot of the &quot;irony and metaphor&quot; that the back coverassures me was in there! Just &quot;whoosh&quot; right over my head, I guess.Marian McAlpin becomes engaged... and inexplicably, her eatinghabits change - first she can't eat meat, picturing the livingbreathing animal it once was. Then eggs. Then everything else! Sheknows she should eat, she knows she must eat, but food of any sortrevolts her. Mix in a nutty roommate who decides to get pregnant,and starts looking for an unwitting &quot;donor&quot; to be the father, andDuncan, a bizarre grad student Marian meets during work (She worksat a survey service, and had to go door to door doing a survey), andyou have a strange yet amusing story about a woman resisting theloss of her identity when she marries. I guess that was what it wasabout anyways.Cute but it seemed a bit light to me, as if Marian just &quot;felt&quot; thesethings but didn't really state them to the reader. There was somecertain shallowness about the book that I can't quite describe."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This is the fourth of Atwood's books I have read. Though I enjoyed it, I didn't find it to be a page turner like The Blind Assassin (I couldn't put that one down).The symbolism was interesting, but the end of the story seemed anticlimactic. I can't say I cared for the ending; the chain of events was interesting but left me wanting more after I finished. I am not one of those people who needs a tidy ending with all of the issues resolved, but I don't feel like it was strong enough.I think that the story is slightly more tame than her others, but maybe that is the point. This seems like it could be snatched directly from some young woman's diary. I read it at a steady pace. I would recommend it to others, but might suggest other works such as Blind Assassin or The Handmaid's Tale first."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I guess I'm not the kind of reader who searches out the symbolism of every novel I read. So the discussion of this book and what the characters are supposed to symbolize may be the reason that many people did not enjoy The Edible Woman. I did. Immensely. I thought it was a hilarious look at the late 1960s in the West and there were many points I could relate to. Here's a rollicking group of young people, extremely intelligent, and full of ideas about the way life should be and how they want to live. In college, or just having graduated, they're getting smacked in the face with the reality of the world: Dull coworkers their own age and older, dull, meaningless jobs when they really want to make a splash; dull marriages and engagements that promise to turn into dull marriages; insane friends, roomates, and situations. Everything's just too much. I found this book a really refreshing--and nostalgic--look at the day before 1970. Of couse, it was written then, so the nostalgia is in the mind of the reader who may recognize that time and place. The book is deep, too. It explores the emotions of Marian, a \\"stolid\\" (I love that word--only Atwood can bring it off) young woman of obviously conventional upbringing. She's on a path that seems not to be of her choosing--though it is--and consciously decides to step off it. How she does this drives the plot and to a great extent the book's other characters. I found the parts about her friend Ainsley wickedly funny, and yes there's a certain amount of bitterness about female stereotyping that goes along with her character. But there's more to it. What we come to discover about Marian, and the whole circle of people she associates with, is that they're really free thinkers disguised as \\"good\\" kids. Marian fast forwards 25 years into her impending marriage and realizes that she wants no part of it. She's rebelling in the only way that she knows. But it's still rebellion. Ainsley, for all her outrageousness, gets pregnant and married. Interestingly, there's no input from any family member in this book. No parents anywhere--and that in itself is very true to the time it was written. I recommend this book. Don't think too much about what it means--just read it and let it speak to you in its own voice."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Atwood's \\"The Edible Woman\\" is a glimpse into the intricate and poignant transformation of an average young woman.Margaret Atwood's breakout piece is rife with symbolism, philosophy and strong anti-consumerism undertones, all whilst maintaining an intriguing and insightful storyline. Her voice is strong and seductive, coaxing the reader into embarking on a journey into the protagonists complex psyche.Marian McAlphin is a sane, controlled, intelligent young woman whom seems to have an ideal life. She has a decent job, a good education and a boyfriend with a bright future he seems to want to share with her. However, one day Marian's world slips strangely out of focus. She finds herself systematically unable to eat certain foods. As she struggles to assert herself and establish her femininity in an oppressively masculine society, Marian begins to see herself as helpless, just like the food she eats. In fact, she begins to identify with the food, seeing her own flesh as the animal flesh she once used to obtusely devour. Marian's metamorphosis draws the reader in, forcing one to examine our own beliefs, prejudices and very way of life. Her descent into the grimy underworld of her own mind is something that is both shocking and surprisingly familiar. A dark story with an unexpected conclusion, the study of a young womans struggle to embrace her femininity whispers and entices.A beautifully written and well crafted novel, it's a must-read for avid Atwood fans and new comers alike. \\"The Edible Woman\\" is a perfect example of Atwood's intricate and alluring style. I thoroughly enjoy and reccomend this novel to anyone searching for a thought-provoking story."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This book was enchanting, it was a pain to have to put it down. This is rather another one of those books about 20-somethings trying to find a place in life, but in this case in a more flavorful way. Duncan is perhaps one of the most appealing male characters I've yet to come across, even though he's a skinny little white boy. Read this book! The metaphors didn't boggly me dow :) It was a hoot to read!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"The Edible Woman was a genuine, outstanding book to read. It was rich with irony and metaphors. I couldn't put it down. It made me think about how society can have such an affect on an individual. It made me realize that in a way that is happening to me and everyone. In the book, Marian wasn't able to eat. She was like being &quot;consumed&quot; by society."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"the edible woman was given to me by a friend over two years ago and i never got around to reading it because i am not a big fan of books with messages and symbols - and usually prefer more straight stories. last week, i was looking for something to read and picked it up and could not put it down; it is very well-written. even before i started i was intrigued by the idea of controlling food in reaction to emotional stress and feeling out-of-control internally as it is too familiar a way of coping in myself and other women around me. i read the book mainly for the story. it was instantly captivated by the many well-developed characters.speaking of characters, pretty much everyone in this book, especially these grad student characters, are at times very funny!PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK:there were no problems at all until the very very end, &lt;I'M WARNING AGAIN, SPOILER&gt;. this is where i am slightly confused. i did not read the book with any kind of symbolism in mind - i am one of the lucky souls who are able to turn off the internal literary analyst and simply not attend to them if i don't feel like it. at the same time, i was of course aware of the numerous symbolic elements in this book like one might be aware of passing by trees on a walking path. when the end came, i thought &quot;is the book really is as simple as this: she leaves peter, gives the cake to this duncan dude? and her only problem was peter all along? where is the enlightenment? where is the maturity? where is the feminist bladiblah where you make a cake and finally break free of all the molds, make your own mold, say &quot;hah!&quot; not just to peter, but to the world and eat the whole damn cake yourself.&quot; see, what marian does is, forget what a great thing she did with the whole cake thing (as if it's one of her other dissociated episodes througout the book), says &quot;it's just a cake&quot; to a comment by ainsley and a few days later, oh, happens to remember there is some left over and finds it on some shelf and feeds it to duncan... seems to make a nice ending i know. but it is a sad ending. what did marian really learn? she appears still just as detached from herself. is she even a little wiser? i can't tell. what will she do next time a man comes to &quot;destroy&quot; her? maybe she will not eat again. maybe she will compulsively clean. if this was atwood's intended ending, then it is a very sad ending. very subtle and given what we know of marian not unlikely either, she is not the type to have sudden enlightenment. that would be cheesy... maybe this is intended. in that case it is quite a brilliant observation about women who can't quite break free. but a deeply sad one.but if atwood wrote the more simple book where we were actually supposed to sympathize with marian and see this as a book where she refuses conservative peter and lets the emaciated oddity duncan consume her, i would be quite disappointed. if this is the book we're talking about, it's a book of breaking free. and then if marian is breaking free, really why let _any_ man eat her cake?&lt;END OF SPOILER&gt;4 stars and not 5 because the symbolism was overpowering and not very subtle. everything in the book seemed to revolve around the one issue of men/women, sometimes at the expense of making narrative unnaturally focused on certain things. you may or may not like that. a couple of times i felt like i was in a gender studies class."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I normally love Margaret Atwood's writing, but this novel really lacked something. Maybe I need to be hit over the head with a message, because I breezed through The Edible Woman without getting any of the deep meaning that I hear about from other readers. The book read like an episode of Ally McBeal. The women were portrayed as irrational or always scheming on men. Atwood should have collaborated on this one with Judith Butler for a harder edge."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"After many unfortuanate instances of having CanLit forced down my throat in high school, it took a lot of pursuading to convince me to read this. The result? Thank you for it.I can't compare this to any of Atwood's other books, but what I can say is that it is worth the read and that it has encouraged me to read more of her work. The characters are entertaining and quirky. Yes, they are odd, but they aren't so strange that you can't picture them living next door. {In fact, my fomer flatmate had an obsession with ironing and would always iron during exams when he got stressed out.}Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a good, amusing read. It would be a great read during long, cold, and dark Canadian winters."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I just finished The Edible Woman a few minutes ago and felt compelled to write a review. This is only the second novel by Atwood that I've read and look foward to reading from her.Very rarely do I ever finish a book without wanting to take a &quot;break&quot; from reading it. Atwood has a way of captivating the reader through her use of irony, character development and symbolism. Marian represents any woman who feels consumed by societal ideals--enough to ultimately reject it. But it is obvious that she still craves someone to escape with her. Peter is her answer to fit into what the world belives she should become while Clara seems to foreshadow what she would turn out to become if she were to be with Peter. Duncan is the antithesis of this, which attracts Marian. His gaunt figure seems to show his refusal to accept reality or consumption of ideals. Everything that I've only dreamed I could do (run away on a whim) is done, or merely attempted by Marian.I know I'm rambling, but I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and cannot wait to read more of her works."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I've enjoyed most of Margaret Atwood's books but I must say that this book was awful. Very one-dimensional and frankly, boring. The ending was poorly written as well. I actually threw this book in the wastebasket after I finished it so that no one else would have to endure it."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This book is clearly by a woman and for other women, kind of like so many magazines. Being published in 1970, its social setting is frankly dated. However, what sets it apart is a deeper level that, frankly, only hit me between the eyes as I reached the halfway point of the book, down to the page. Just who is this Duncan character anyway? And what makes him tick? Atwood's photo reminds me of Alanis Morrissette plus 25 years and, in a way, so does her writing; at least there's a family resemblance :) I'm a man and I don't understand women but this book helped NOT :) But I couldn't put it down. Good read, but she's no Tom Wolfe."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This is the first book I read by Margaret Atwood, it was written in 1965 but I believe that the only aspects giving away the years depicted are the absence of modern technolgy in the narrative (i.e. mobile phones, computers etc. -not that this is a \\"technological\\" read anyway, just the opposite) and perhaps, only perhaps, -that's the way I perceived it- a certain candour in some of the characters/situations which conveys \\"something\\" dated.It's the tale of Marian, a quiet, well-brought up girl in her early 20s who's struggling to conform to the demands and unwritten rules of society. This is not because she does not want to, in fact, she would like to, but she realises that her inner self craves more than a proper, suitable and predictable routine (a good job, a respectable marriage, children in due time etc.), as it was expected -and often still is, if you think about it-. Something in her rebels, in a subtle but undeniably determined way. Will she manage to tackle and overcome her gnawing uneasiness, consistently on the rise, rapidly becoming a true torment and assailing her inner being? (A fact that her \\"cool\\" but obtuse boyfriend completely fails to see). That's for you to find out if you get this book.Bearing in mind the year in which it was written, some considerations about our modern society arise. Have women's -and men's- roles changed much since then? Of course they have, in many ways. Still, could and can a demanding society have such an impact in the configuration of our lives -or, in what we thought/think our life should be like- that sometimes we felt and feel crushed under the pressure? Has the vortex of speed in which the world has changed in this past century -with its good and bad consequences- changed the core of human nature? These are questions which came to mind as soon as I turned the last page.I'm glad I read this book, but at the same time I cannot honestly place it among my favourites. For instance, in the beginning it almost completely failed to engage me and I kept on only because I always do (as a principle). Thankfully the tale got more interesting later on, which helped, even though I think the author was overly-descriptive especially, but not only, in connection with Marian's issues, rendering the read a bit tedious. Still, and it may sound like a contradiction, I do think it was worth reading it, because it triggers questions and comparisons with today's Western society, and it was certainly worth it for the quality of its prose, essentially studied and quite elegant."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Most people would agree that Margaret Atwood's later work is much stronger than her earlier, but this book may be an exception. Though not a standout like &quot;Alias Grace&quot; or &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; is engaging storytelling.The characters are interesting and the story is engrossing. The tension, discontent, and yearning is almost palatable. A good read!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This was my first Margaret Atwood novel. After reading it, I realized my standards have been much to low. Atwood showed me how interesting and bizarre a story can be, how many layers it can have, the beauty of the English language. Plus, it didn't hurt that a lot of it took place in some very familiar settings, making me feel nostalgiac. How can I go back to reading &quot;popular fiction&quot; after experiencing her breathtaking style? From now on, it's Atwood all the way, baby! Anyone who hasn't already picked up a novel by this talented lady of letters, take the Atwood plunge; you'll be doing yourself a favour."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"The book &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; was fantastic. The story was great and the book was actually fun to read. I'm in oac English and have a hard time finding books I want to read but this one caught my eye. It grabbed me from the beginning and kept me wanting to read right until the end. The content of the book was challenging but not to confusing or mind boggling. Therefore it was enjoyable. I really enjoy Margaret Atwoods books and I hope she continues to write some excellent novels like she has in the past!!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Marian does not want to fold under the pressures of society or of the people in her life. After realizing she can't run away or hide from her problems, she confronts them and solves them by eating them. This story was awesome. Although slow at first, this story was very thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I first read this when I was 11, and thought it was pretty good. Then, at 16, I have decided to reread many books I read when I was younger to see if I could get more out of them. Boy, did I get more out of this book. It's hilarious and written in such a light manner, but can also get serious at moments. Atwood has done the book in an odd, rather creative style. The first fifty pages or so are written in first person, then it switches to third person as Marian unwittingly becomes prey to her own lifestyle, then back to first person again at the end. Throughout the book, Marian seems overly concerned with being percieved as &quot;normal&quot;, yet it innately attracted to Duncan, the very opposite of normal. She has a bit of a double life going for a while, where on one end she has Peter, who at one point she describes as elevated ordinariness.As Marian slowly loses her ablity to eat, she also becomes consumed by her life with Peter and her life with Duncan. Peter loves her, Duncan doesn't even like her that much. They are both extraordinarily selfish individuals, though Duncan is a bit more overt about it.Marian sees the different choices she can make as far as her life is concerned in her female friends. Clara has tons of babies already, and Ainsley is convinced that she has to have a child alone in order to fully experience her feminimity. There are also the &quot;office virgins&quot;, who are restless to snag the life Marian has with Peter. They want normalcy.Marian doesn't know what she wants, so she lets Peter take over and make most of the decisions. But really she isn't satisfied with this and turns to Duncan. She kind of drifts, not really ever concerned with making a decision between the two, not really sure that she has to.Atwood is one of my favorite writers because she creates such complex situations in her stories and her characters are all so dimensional. This story is a fascinating read, and I highly recommend it as well as any of her other novels."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This is a book you can read over and over. I read it about ten years ago and I still remember the poetic treatment Atwood gave to even mundane things like a shower curtain. The book has a strange, dreamy feel and yet, at the same time, it is real and easy to identify with."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Bloody brilliant! I was NOT a fan of Atwood's to start with, having read the Handmaid's Tale in 7th grade (it probably was a bit early, though I liked Hemingway at the time, at least The Old Man and the Sea).I picked up the book at random in a library, after having disliked another book of Atwood's at the University too (I think it was Surfacing).Having nothing better to do, I started reading Edible Woman and got hooked.Some things really resonated with my own life and it was really awkward to see how life of a young woman in 1960s in Canada could be so similar to a woman in 3rd Millenium in what some refer to as Eastern Europe/ex-Yugoslavia.Her book makes MUCH sense to any budding environmentalist or woman in general, and should be required reading to any aspirational eco activist (especially if from ex-communist countries). (And I am someone who tries to avoid the word 'should'!)What she writes just makes so much sense. We live in a country that almost overnight got suckered into consumerism at its worst, and this book shows how it's done. Draft after draft of consumer survey (the main heroine works in a survey company). It's a hilarious and poignant observation on consumerism at its worst, and poses many questions to people (and answers some). There are some environmental bits in it, which are also very clear to anyone with a bit of sense and knowledge about these things. (eg one of the main characters grew up in a chemically polluted town, no wonder he's so mixed up.)She doesn't address those things directly, there's no preaching involved. I can't help but think that it's no wonder that Canada is so far ahead of us in some things with regard to resource/waste management and environment, with excellent literature like this!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"The first novel published by Margaret Atwood. A woman loses her balance after her boyfriend proposes to her. She discovers that he is not The One for her. There are two other choices depicted in the novel: one of her friends is married and has children, her other friend decides to have a child but she plans to use a man only as a tool to achieve her goal.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book as it shows us how the conscious self and the unconscious self interacts in a human being. Marian defends her integrity by letting her unconscious self rebel against the constraints of society. She wants negotiable human relationships and not rigid institutions. Peter, her fianc&eacute;, accepts social conventions and becomes a cog in the machinery, which Marian is simply uncapable of."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"The Edible Woman, though written several years ago, contains characters (both male and female) that are easily recognizable today. Not as fully imagined as The Handmaid's Tale or The Robber Bride, but still an engaging look at societal expectations and interpersonal relationships. A good read!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Margaret Atwood always depicts fascinating, well-rounded women, but Marian and company are the best of the bunch. Each is torn in a different direction by her female identity and ideas of her obligation to normalcy. Marian plans to marry but shows no real enthusiasm for the idea and begins to disappear as the engagement continues. Ainsley is determined to bear a child to fulfil her biological destiny, but sees men purely as a means to an end. Clara, married and a mother, is bewildered and somewhat disgusted at having three children and appears to Marian as a queen termite figure, giving birth over and over. The book is full of deliciously mean humor as the women wander baffled through the stages of traditional womanhood and attempt to save their senses of self on the way."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I have read and enjoyed many of Margaret Atwood's books, especially Oryx and Crake and The Robber Bride. The Edible Woman was Atwood's first published novel. It's definitely not her best, but I recommend it.The setting is late 1960s Canada. Marian, our protagonist, is on the trajectory that society expected of her at the time. She's going to get married, leave her job and, well, be a housewife.Is she fulfilling expectations, or are expectations consuming her? Is she on a path to self-realization, or will she subsume her own identity and desires to those of her fianc&eacute; and society at large?The Edible Woman uses food metaphorically, as the title would suggest. Marian's relationship with food reflects her journey as she teeters on the edge of living the life that is expected of her.There were some truly funny, insightful moments. Marian's voice was effective and her character well-realized. But I found the other characters in the novel to be vague, shapeless caricatures. They didn't seem like real people, each of them being too specifically defined by their quirks and their purpose in the story. The food metaphor, too, while effective, was way too front-and-center for my, er, taste. I've read reviews that praise this food metaphor as an early, prescient look at eating disorders as tied to gender roles and expectations, but I'm not sure I believe that Atwood had eating disorders, as a disease, in mind. Perhaps I'm not giving her enough credit.All in all, I appreciated The Edible Woman, but it really did have the feeling of a first novel. Read it, and then go on to read Atwood's other and better works!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"while i must admit that this one didn't thrill me as much as her other works, like the blind assasin, handmaid's tale, lady oracle, or cats eye, to name but a few...atwood still had me reading and laughing throughout her book. her characters, especially our main focus, marian, is vividly portrayed as a pathetic hum drum of a woman who slowly and hilariously lets the world know what is truly lying beneath...and atwood's switch from first person to third in the various \\"books\\" within her novel never allows for monotony...which is just what threatens our dear heroine's(?) life. read it. she's genius."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This book was a bit challenging to rate because I had read all of Margaret Atwood's other novels before I read this one; her first. Ms. Atwood is a brilliant author and conveyor of the feminine mind and perspective. Some of her novels are outstanding while most are at least very good. &quot;The Edible Woman&quot; is an excellent beginning for the author but it has its' flaws. The main flaw is the symbolism. The symbolism is too forced and it doesn't work well. I found myself wondering if I wanted to spend the time trying to figure out the symbolism. I decided that I didn't. The symbolism centers around the inability of the main character to eat a growing number of foods. I guess this was to coincide with the events in her life in which she was being &quot;consumed&quot; by those around her. The author's talent gave us a good enough story without the food distractions. It is a story of a young professional woman who seems to know what she wants but lets others call the shots. She enters into relationships with two different men neither of whom is in anyway suited for her. We are glad that the relationship with her fiance fizzles but we are left wondering why she ever got involved with the graduate student. We rejoice at her ultimate independence but are made to sift through the final installment of symbolism in order to do so.Ms. Atwood has used symbolism since her opening act as a novelist. However, to her credit, she learned to be more subtle about it. This was a good beginning and it only gets better from here on."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"This book wasn't very good. Though skillfully written, I found it dry and not very insightful. It is very focused on gender and I wonder if I wouldn't have enjoyed it more were I a woman. Though frankly, none of the woman I know are this husband obsessed or shallow. At the end of the book I was reading the talking points for students and was shocked to find that aspects of the book are considered a dark comedy. Not once did I ever think, \\"How clever\\" or \\"How morbidly funny\\". The metaphors were very heavy-handed and obvious. You never wonder what is going on, it's there in print in front of you. The only thing that isn't clear are the main character's motivation for making herself miserable. We all know (herself included) that there are very few external forces working upon her. Her misery is entirely of her own volition, yet she seems helpless to change her circumstances.I liken the book to a dull version of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. But in print form and without the whimsy and insight."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Marian - a public researcher in a dead end job. She feels restless and unfulfilled, not realising that this is due to having no prospects and no true place as a woman in society.Into the bargain steps Peter a trainee lawyer, her boyfriend and a devotee of society. In a fit of expressive melancholic madness Marian agrees to marry him, dragging herself further into her self delusion and unhappiness.This novel is concerned with the roles society offers us and what happens when we either do not fit in or openly avoid them. Written at the peak of 'women's rights', Atwood takes a moral stance with her character - Marian - denying both male superiority and the need for social acceptance. She does this superbly, adapting the gritty realism of the real world into a humourous relationship where nothing seems to work out just right! The snide jabs at society are all first class right down to the last chapter, where (for all those that want a sneak preview) Marian goes one up on Duncan after realising he is as trapped as she is. In short: An excellent book that should not be missed!"},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Marian appears to be an average woman with average friendships and relationships, working an average job and leading an average life. However, when she gets engaged to her boyfriend her life begins to change. Marian can't eat: first meat, and then vegetables, and finally anything at all. As she struggles through her issues with food, she carries on a bizarre and selfish friendship/affair with a mysterious young man. This is a story about the bizarre appearing within the mundane. The writing style especially at the beginning of the book is almost painfully plain, but the promise of strange events to come and the introduction of a particuarly bizarre character keep the reader interested. It grows into a somewhat neurotic, strange book that, despite its mundane, even boring beginning, is easy to get lost in and worth exploring to the end. I didn't take a very strong liking to this text, but I still recommended it. Atwood is a talented writer and Marian's story is a compelling tale and warning.The first third of this book was frustrating in a very strange way. The protagonist leads such a boring life and the people that surround her are so frustrating and immature that I wasn't sure why I was still reading. Somehow, however, Atwood manages to build up this incredibly mundane and average setting without driving the reader to distraction. Somehow the text remains readable, even compelling. Chapters fly by. It's a confusing experience but I think it shows real talent on the part of the author. Without this setting, the rest of the book wouldn't be either so peculiar or so meaningful, but the introduction could have easily lead all readers to put the book down from the onset.As for the body of the story itself--the metaphor of a woman that can't eat but is rather being eaten is pervasive, but the book manages to carry out a fairly solid plot despite the basis in the metaphorical and bizarre. The secondary male character is engrossing in his own right: entirely selfish but at the same time easy to be interested in and love; Marian's relationship with him is described in such a straightforward way that the reader identifies with it despite its strange and questionable nature. The metaphor of the edible woman builds slowly but reaches a very heavy, literal climax. All in all, this is a hard book for me to sum up: it both mundane and exceptional, literal and metaphorical, and somehow kept me reading through to the end despite the first third of the book and my lack of interest in the general subject. I don't know what to say about it.However, the fact that I did read through this book quickly and found it hard to pull myself away from it does say something. Despite the book's beginning, subject matter, and strange contradictions in style and purpose, it reads well and builds up to an iconic, dramatic conclusion. The disparate aspects carry through and resolve. For that reason, I recommend it. Atwood manages to do a lot with this text, and while it isn't the best or most memorable book that I've read, it is unique. The metaphor of the edible woman is perhaps reason enough to read this text, and the writing style, somehow compelling despite dealing with such an average setting, makes the book hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Many authors who have risen to the heights of fame and acclaim that Atwood has reached have forgettable first novels, but Atwood is a clear exception to that. The Edible Woman is brazen, thought-provoking,and amusing all at the same time.Marian McAlpin is a recent college graduate living in an unnamed Canadian city. She began dating Peter, an attorney, just as she started her job as a copy writer at a marketing research firm. Before she even realized that their relationship was serious or \\"going somewhere\\", she and Peter become engaged. Strangely enough, it happens after a fit of anxiety that literary causes Marian to run frantically into the night, away from Peter and the possibility of captivity.The wedding plans are hastily taken over by Marian's family, the plans for the rest of their life are taken over by Peter (plans that included Marian quiting her job and becoming a housewife) and Marian begins to feel consumed.Marian's onset of food aversions are comical, but also very symbolic--the thought of being coldly and methodically consumed keeps Marian from eating during the weeks leading up to her wedding as she tries to imagine giving up her independence.Nearly every aspect of this novel is a symbol, a cultural comment of some kind. The most obvious, of course, is about food, but there are others, including the deep pit Marian stares into just days before her wedding. The characters are also neatly compartmentalized into varying degrees of traditional stagnation. They range from the stodgy old sexless landlady; the 3 \\"office virgins\\" at Marian's company; Clara, a college friend who is deeply immersed in the doldrums of wifery and motherhood; and the scheming Ainsley, Marian's roommate who plots to become pregnant with the help of an unsuspecting man. Peter, Marian's fiancee, openly balks at marriage at the novel's beginning; however, superb plot development shows that men have nothing to lose and everything to gain. It's the wife-to-be who is expected to surrender everything. Not-so-subtle remarks about uppity women who \\"trap\\" men by becoming pregnant (like Ainsley and the wife of Peter's friend Trigger) and about the perils of educating women (it's a risk to allow them to get ideas, you see) make this novel all the more wonderful.This is not a lightweight novel, in spite of its somewhat silly subject matter and hilarious plot twists. Only those who go in with their eyes wide open will finish this novel having been enriched and satisfied."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Although this novel is classified as significant feminist literature, it's still a fun read. Plus Atwood really is a talented word-smith.It's the 1960's, when women were expected to stay at home and greet their husbands after work, while donning a pretty dress and serving up a martini. So of course, ever since her engagement, independent Marian McAlpin finds herself suddenly unable to eat meat, then eggs, then vegetables, then anything! Subconsciouly she is stifled by societal expectations of women, and thus her body is rebelling. Or if you want to look deeper, she is standing in solidarity with food as prey, which is prepared for human consumption, just as women are prey, and assimilated or made 'feminine' for society's consumption. Suddenly eating food makes her feel like a cannibal! Or at least so says Wikipedia.But in spite of the heavy symbolism, the characters are funny and almost cartoonish - somehow they are easy to enjoy, as is Atwood's elegant, eerie prose. I especially appreciated the oddball ending, which was reminiscent of an episode of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" and not half as sad as I thought it would be."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"I loved this book. It was quite different from anything else I have ever read, although Margaret Atwood's work is always refreshing and different. I love her sense of humor that is quite unique and how she could conceive such round and colorful characters is beyond me. She uses vivid descriptions and brings to life the lives of the people, and long after I read the story, I thought of it, and how little bits of it was reflected in my own life.

I'm taking a guess, but I think this is Atwood's first novel. It's a psychological character driven story in which a woman finds herself in a relationship she doesn't really care for, and before she knows it she's engaged to be married. She doesn't know how to get out of the engagement, so she goes along with it, but at the same time she is slowly losing the desire to eat. While this is all going on, she meets a man (a somewhat delinquent type of college student is the impression I get) during an interview.Marian McAlpin works for a company (Seymour Surveys) where she has to find people to interview for various products. This is how she meets Duncan (and his \\"parents\\" Fischer and Trevor) and she is drawn to him. They carry on an illicit relationship while at the same time she keeps up the facade of being engaged to Peter, a man she really does not want to be with.Marian's roommate Ainsley is another problem. Ainsley is trying to get pregnant (previously she was totally against having children) and latches on to Len, Marian's long time friend, and seduces him. Len had no idea what Ainsley was planning, and you can guess how he reacts when he figures out what Ainsley is up to.And there is also Clara, Marian's friend who has several children(all toddlers). Clara's life revolves around her children and seems to have no life outside of it.I'm not sure what I really think about this book. It was an interesting read, and my views on it may be skewed since I read it after my mother passed away. I also didn't read it all at once, but slowly, which may also have affected how I feel about it. I think for Atwood fans, I'd recommend this book.

It is a great book for anyone who enjoys superb writing and characters they can both relate to, become shocked by, yet understand! It's hard to describe how amazing this work is, it explores so much about the human experience.

She seemed to have an attitude of distaste towards interview questions and perhaps the Interviewer. However, I had to admit to myself that I often only heard snippets of these interviews and made a poor judgment based on very little information - that's not fair.After reading the sample, I went ahead and bought the ebook version of \\"The Edible Woman\\". Well, golly gee, was I ever off base! She is a terrific writer!! I enjoyed the rich descriptions of each setting and the well-developed characters as they moved through the interesting storyline. The ending was excellent because I could not have predicted the outcome, making this book a great read from start to finish!

It was quite obvious that more was going on than just what was written on the page. Unfortunately, I couldn't quite figure out what the actual message was supposed to be. Women sabotage themselves? They relinquish control to men? They need to fix people? They judge each other? Food issues are a sign of insecurity? Even food has feelings? Something else entirely? I couldn't grasp the point.The story itself was decent, but not very compelling. It took me a long while to finish the book because it was such dry reading. I usually thoroughly enjoy Margaret Atwood's books, but this early novel was not her best."},{"Title":"The Edible Woman: Based on the Novel by Margaret Atwood","review":"Edible Woman / 0-385-49106-9Probably one of Atwood's most surreal novel, as the main character of \\"Edible Woman\\" finds herself \\"consumed\\" by her plans for a wedding and married life, she also finds that she cannot consume an increasingly large list of foods without becoming violently ill. Her mysterious illness eventually results in her being unable to eat anything at all, intensely afraid of causing harm to the world around her.The symbolism within the novel is incredibly heavy, and revolves around women eating and being eaten by the world around them. Each of the women in the novel - and several of the men - are completely consumed by their own individual fears and desires, as well as the societal expectations being laid upon them by others. In typical Atwood fashion, nearly every character is a victim of something, with few true villains to point at, and no real answers offered. The ending is neither happy nor tidy, and will likely lead the reader to feel disappointed and sad, but the reader's disappointment will be with harsh reality, and not with the author or her excellent writing.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Sparse Distributed Memory (Bradford Books)","review":"I'm biased since I have worked with Pentti on his Sparse Distributed Memories at NASA Ames. I would highly recommend you reading his book since he is very careful and general in his use of statistics of large bit vectors.

Indeed, she lost her job and her boyfriend in the same day when he tried to transfer from television to radio where the audience couldn't see her scars. Instead, Elyssa resumed a job she loved years ago, working as Lulu the Clown. Her favorite place to entertain kids is on the cancer ward of a nearby hospital, which is where she meets the pediatric oncologist Brett Cameron.The beautiful reporter on the late news entranced Brett. When Elyssa disappeared from the screen, he didn't think much about it until she showed up regularly to perform the children in his care. Although she's extremely reticent about spending time with him, Brett is determined to know her better. Never mind he's decided that a busy career and family life don't mix, and that he's been terribly wounded by the loss of a wife and child. But as danger closes in and as Elyssa realizes the car wreck was no accident, Brett is swept away by the woman behind the clown makeup.When Elyssa was initially injured, her fellow reporter Randy was driving the car. He was killed in the accident. A year and half later, his widow Jenny approaches Elyssa with her suspicions that the wreck was no accident. Someone wanted Randy's story stifled. Elyssa's eventual inquiry sets extreme danger into motion.Author Lorna Michaels pens an intriguing romance about recovering from scars, both internal and external. Unfortunately, Elyssa comes across as superficial when the reader learns that \\"she wasn't disfigured\\". Her need for perfection also seems extremely superficial when her slight facial flaws are contrasted with a woman with a double mastectomy or children with cancer. However, Michaels does successfully balance Elyssa's superficiality when a surgeon promises better results toward the end of the book, and she declines, expressing satisfaction with her appearance. Also, I had a problem with Brett being so wildly attracted to a woman covered in clown makeup during the first month of their relationship, especially when she \\"smells like sex\\" after entertaining children for an hour. Nevertheless, I can't help loving a heroine able to wield a skillet her own defense. THE TRUTH ABOUT ELYSSA is recommended."},{"Title":"Truth About Elyssa (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"The moment TV news reporter Elyssa Jarmon accepts a ride home from her friend, Randy Barber, her life is never the same.

Deenie isn't too hot on the idea, but she doesn't despise it either. She goes along with her mother's wishes only to please her. All these dreams come to a crashing halt when Deenie gets diagnosed with scoliosis. What's worse, her doctor tells her the best way to treat her spine is to put her in a Milwaukee brace for four years. Deenie takes the news hard, but it seems like her mother takes it even worse. The rest of the book explores how Deenie copes with this new change in her life.I would recommend this book to girls between the ages of 12-16. It addresses issues that concern girls in that age group. This book changed my perception of scoliosis. Prior to reading this book, I thought the brace was only worn for a few weeks or maybe a few monthes. I had no idea it was worn for years. My heart goes out to anyone who has had to cope with this adjustment. In my opinion, the most important part of this book is when Deenie accepts that this temporary problem will lead to a long-term solution and handles it with grace and maturity.~Miss L"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I picked up this book because it's commonly a \\"banned book\\", and I have to read a selection of those for a childrens/teens writing course I am taking to polish up my writing for publication.Judy Blume is one of my favorite authors. From her popular \\"Fudge\\" series, to \\"Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret,\\" she has a fresh way of writing about teenagers and the struggles they go through.\\"Deenie\\" is one such teenager. She's a 7th-grade teenager who loves to hang out with her friends, has a crush on a boy named Buddy, and isn't quite sure how to stand up to her selfish, domineering mother when she insists on taking Deenie to modeling interviews each Saturday when she's rather go to the mall with her friends.Pretty typical teenager, huh?However, she is also nervous and unsure (and a bit cruel) in her dealings with the handicapped. For example, one of the girls in her gym class has bad eczema rashes (that are NOT catching), yet Deenie privately calls her \\"The Creeping Crud\\" and is afraid to hold her hands in modern dance, and runs to wash her hands several times if she does.So, it's a bit ironic that she almost become \\"one of them\\" when she gets diagnosed with \\"adolescent idiopathic scoliosis\\".What that jumble of words means is that is that she has a case of teenage scoliosis (it progress rapidly during growth spurts) and they have no idea why she got it, especially since there is no sign of it either on her mothers side or her father's.She ends up having to wear an uncomfortable-sounding metal-and-plastic brace of sorts that is supposed to correct the curvature of her spine while she's a teenager and hopefully prevent the need for surgery to correct it when she gets older. The brace, called a Milwaukee Brace, goes from a sort of metal collar around her neck, to the base of her spine, and she has to wear it for 23 hours, 365 days a week (unless she's swimming or bathing); and that includes sleeping.This book is often classified as a \\"banned book,\\" because it deals frankly (yet a little vaguely) on the topic of masturbation.Deenie sometimes \\"touches her special place\\" when she's feeling scared and can't sleep. Then, in sex ed at school, the topic comes up again, and the teacher explains that is normal and not dangerous if young boys and girls do it.Personally, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. This book was written for teenagers to show them that it is normal to feel scared, unsure about growing up or to have hormones and want to kiss the opposite sex. However, it was written at a time when all that sort of talk was taboo, I guess, and this book is frequently pulled from libraries and reading lists because some parents can't look past those bits, and see the character of Deenie as being a frightened teenager who has to deal with a monumental change.This book is written for 10-14 year-old kids and it's not really for anyone younger.However, I would have no problem letting my daughter read this and discuss its content with me when she becomes a teenager.A great book; no wonder is a classic, even if it was originally written in 1971!"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Rather than an actual review of the book (as I am a mother of 7 now) this is more a few comments.First, when I last read Deenie, I remember that as usual, Blume wrote with an open, honestness that many writers glossed over...she touched on subjects that were still \\"taboo\\" to some degree which is why many libraries \\"challenged\\" the book. I remember when all the teenage girls started reading Sooner or Later and Waiting Games after seeing the after school special Sooner or Later and we all had crushes on Rex Smith. It was certainly taboo that a book we were all reading in study hall was talking about s*x, and whether or not Jessie would actually \\"do it\\".Remember, this was before Fast Times at Ridgemont High even... *grin*We knew girls at school got pregnant, but they conveniently \\"went somewhere\\" before they started to show and came back after the situation was taken care of and the schools were even hush hush about mono.I actually want to recommend this book to parents of teenage girls.It does touch on some issues of insecurities...and truthfully, it would be GREAT if Blume wrote for our teenage daughters today!Mothers and fathers REALLY need to be aware of what their children are reading now more than ever!It really is quite unsettling what you will find if you spend some time browsing through the teen section and reading through some of what the teenagers are reading today. Some of it is nothing less than [...] literature, I kid you not! Our daughters need a bit more of the honestness and innocence without all the trash that accompanies so much of the \\"so-called\\" literature they read today!"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I usually disliked reading but after reading deenie i cant take my eyes off of any other Judy Blume book. i had read that book in a week and it surprised me because i hate to read and instead of watching the television i had my eyes glued to this book.

This is the Best book i have ever read and i wish it was my summer reading book but thats a whole other story. i am now reading \\"Its not the end of the world\\" by Judy Blume and this seems to be a great book too.

She is very pretty and has tried to get a contract with modeling several times, but all of them make a comment about her posture. Deenie's PE teacher asks her to bend over so that she can see if she has scoliosis. The teacher calls Deenie's parents and tells them that they need to set up an appointment with an orthopedic doctor to check her spine. When they take her to the doctor they find that she has scoliosis and has to be in a back brace that will help to correct and prevent the curve of her spine to get worse. Deenie thinks that it is going to be the end of her life, because everyone will be able to tell that she has a brace on and they would not like her anymore. She does not want to go to school because she does not want everyone to make fun of her. Deenie's friends try to cheer her up and make her think that she is not different then anyone else in anyway. There is a guy that Deenie likes and she tries to avoid him so that he will not see that she has to wear this brace. She tries to talk her dad in to letting her take the brace of for a party that she was going to with all of her friends because she knew that the guy she liked was going to be there. Her dad would not let her take it off so she decided that she would bring clothes to change into at the party and would not let her dad know. When she got there she decided not to take it of because she did not want to go behind her dad's back like that.

It was only maybe 2 sentences, not &quot;written all over it&quot; like the first reviewer said. All in all, i think even in the pedagogical sense this book is a good one - teaching kids to identify with people who have problems. Deannie, the supposed &quot;cripple&quot; is also beautiful and popular, which is a nice change. Other than that, it is a good book about family and growing up."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"The book Deenie by Judy Blume is filled with many hopes and dreams. It\`s about a girl named Deenie and how her mother has her life worked out to be a model. Along with her mom's help, she hopes she will be able to fulfill that dream. Deenie's mom is always pushing her to be the best she can be and tries to help her succeed in all the aspects of her life. Deenie also loves hanging out with her friends and doing well in school.One day at school she was trying out for cheerleading and her coach noticed that there was something wrong with her back. She called Deenie down to talk to her and told Deenie that she was going to call her parents about her concerns. That night Deenie answered the phone and found out that her coach thought she had some serious back problems. Deenie was worried about what her coach had said to her parents.Deenie's parents immediately set up some appointments to see the doctor to find out what was wrong with their daughter. Eventually, Deenie found out the news that she had scoliosis. Deenie would have to wear a brace for four years to fix the curve of her spine. All of her hopes and dreams of becoming a model were shattered! She has to go through tons of other appointments to fix her spine. After Deenie gets her brace her biggest challenge was trying to explain it to everyone at school. She also had to overcome the challenges of wearing the brace from her hip to her neck. How will she ever face the more difficult times ahead of her?Read Deenie to see what happens to Deenie and if her dreams of becoming a model ever come true. This book was a great book full of love, worries, hope, and adventure. Be sure to read the fiction book Deenie by Judy Blume."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"When I was seven years old, my doctor told my family and me that I had a case of scoliosis. Like Deenie, I was put into a brace. Unlike Deenie, I wore a brace that did not have a neck part with it. My brace was the Boston Brace and it covered only my spine. I was always worried about what others thought of me because I was different. No one ever really cared, though. They could see what was on the inside other than what was on the outside. And I thank all those people who treated me the same. It sounds as if I was handicaped the way I am thanking people, but I was not. I was just another girl in the world. Still today, I have scoliosis and I am going into a conference next month about sugery. For 8 years I have worn braces and been in and out of doctors offices.I want to thank Ms. Blume for writting this book and helping me understand how another teenager may feel towards her scoliosis. Like Deenie, I dreamed of becomming a model. For a year now, I have had many modeling offerings and because of my scoliosis I have had to turn them down.

I had heard from numerous people about the marvelous wonders of Judy Blume books, but there was little to nothing I liked about Deenie. I found the characters to be annoying and the story was not enticing. I found myself bored, and the book is only 144 pages!I really was not a fan of any of the characters, but most particularly the mom and aunt. This about sums out what I got out of those two: You need to be a model. Oh wait, you have scoliosis?? It's YOUR fault. Stop being inconsiderate to us, because we want you to be a model we're ugly hags who can't be models ourselves - I absolutely could not stand them, they just were naggy and annoying.The plot was very basic. I didn't find myself real attached to the plot or anything - I was a bit bored for most of the book.

I had a couple of friends with scoliosis. Until recently, back braces were with metal strips and collars.

As part of our assignment, we were to read a book that was put on a censored list and write our personal review.This book was extremely interesting to me. I have to admit that I was a little shocked at the inclusion of the topic of masturbation. I personally feel that it could have been left out of this story.This book could be used to help other girls that have been diagnosed with scoliosis. It is explained in a way that brought it to reality. The person diagnosed as well as their friends could understand all aspects of what was happening or going to happen. The expression of feelings was real and vivid. Young teenage girls have to face so many changes in their life at that stage, that adding to it with scoliosis only makes it worse. I feel confident in saying that I would use this book as a teaching tool in a similar situation."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"If you or someone close to you has scoliosis, this is the book you should buy. Even though back braces are not used nowadays, this book can definitly make a person with scoliosis feel better. For one thing, Deenie is a normal, teenage girl who wants to do normal teenage things. But her strict mother wants her to be a model. She keeps saying, \\"God gave you a beautiful face. He wouldn't have given it to you if He didn't want you to put it to good use.\\" The mother tells the older daughter the same thing, except about her brain. I must admit, this book gets kind of depressing; the older daughter's boyfriend (who works for her father) is fired from his job b/c the father needs the extra money to pay for Deenie's doctor bills. (Not to mention the father is very quiet; not like the mother.) Overall, if you've been through similar events, this book may make you feel better."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"This was probably one of the more boring books of Judy Blume. Not really a bad book. I just liked other Blume books better. ...P>This book was very sad and depressing, but it would be a good read for someone with scoliosis. People should keep in mind that this book was written in another decade, so back braces may have looked different back then and the issue was treated a little differently perhaps. To the reviewer who referred to Deenie as having a \\"deformity\\"--what? Did Deenie suddenly grow three new legs? Come on!It was sad how mean the mother was. I can't stand it when parents try to tell their kids what they think they should be when they grow up. It wasn't fair to Deenie to try to make her go into modeling.&lt;P...If you are a huge Judy Blume fan, complete your collection with this book, but don't expect it to be up to par with all the other ones.

Deenie is only 13 and has to go to different places to be interviewed so she can be a model. But every person that interviewed Deenie said that her back was not strait. Soon after being checked by a few docters, Deenie and her family found out that her spine curved another way instead of growing strait. How was she going to be a model if her back isn't strait? Or does she really want to be a model herself?"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I really loved this book. I recommend it to everyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"This amazing book lead me to understand what life is like for a person with scoliosis. My best friend just developed it this year and she has to wear a brace. I used to always tell her how bad I felt for her, and stuff like that. This book showed me that even though it may be hard, you can still be yourself and have fun with you life. This book is about a girl named Deenie who has developed scoliosis. She is beautiful, and her mother is shocked at the news. Her mother wants her to become a model. Deenie, on top of this, has to deal with siblings, school, and the fights of her parents. This is a great book and has made me encourage my friend rather than pitying her."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie is a great book. It's about a girl that gets scoliosis. She has to wear a back brace that she hates,I would too. One day she gets so sick of wearing that thing, so she does something that she will regret,I don't want to tell you because it should be a surprise. One reason that I like this book is because Deenie is close to my age and Judy Blume is a great author. The ending was shocking, but the book was exciting. I first read this book in 5th grade because my friend had read it and wanted me to, so I did. Now, I'm no book worm, but when I read that book I didn't want to stop. If you haven't read Deenie, I encourage you to."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I first read &quot;Deenie&quot; when I was 12 years old. I am now 24 and still feel that &quot;Deenie&quot; was one of the books I read which had a major impact on the way I am now. True, I have not had Scoliosis, but a minority of young girls have and Judy Blume has provided a sensitive insight into the issues and decisions faced, identifying the inevitable problems which come with Scoliosis, whether you like them or not.&quot;Deenie&quot; equips us to recognise the fact that not all children grow up the same way - be it through Deenie coping with Scoliosis or Deenie's own feelings towards a now-handicapped girl taking the &quot;special bus&quot; to the &quot;special class&quot; at school...There have been many readers who feel that &quot;Deenie&quot; contains sexual innuendo/descriptions of a graphic nature, but I think that graphic is a strong word to use in this case. Of course masterbation is sensitive and personal, but at one time or another every person has done it - there should be no reason to cloak an issue which has been dealt with both adultly and factually in this book. Many young adults still worry themselves silly over old wives tales and &quot;Deenie&quot; explains that masterbation forms part of a rite of passage when you grow up.If parents feel strongly that they need to censor their children's reading, then read the book before them and make your own decision.."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Laure Leaf, 1991, 144pp., $5.50ISBN 0440932599DeenieJudy Blume\\"No! I am never wearing that.....EVER!\\" Imagine having the perfect life, being a beautiful girl who wanted to soar high in life, who had wonderful friends, a boy she secretly loved and the boy loved her back too, and a loving family.Until the one day. The one day when you go to the doctor's office and he says, \\"You have scoliosis, a serious back problem. You will have to wear a brace for a couple of years.\\"The brace was hideous with medal bars and everything Deenie imagined to be the worst that could happen to her. All of Deenie's dreams are crushed. Her mother's expectations for Deenie to have a fulfilling modeling career have come to a close. Deenie's friends start acting odd around her trying to not make her feel bad about the brace. The conversations with her friends only made her feel worse. Because of the brace, her family was falling apart, and the negativity toward her outside appearance was making her inner beauty turn ugly.Through this experience Deenie embarks on a new journey in life. I would recommend this book to teenage girls who like Judy Blume and her stories. I truly enjoyed following Deenie through the highs and lows during her life and I hope you do too."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"This book is about a girl named Dennie who is very pretty and her mom always wanted her to be a model. One day the doctor tells her she has scoliosis and she has to wear a back brace. From then on the rest of the book is about what happens to her after she gets a brace.What I liked most about the book were the things that happened to Dennie after she got the brace. Not the bad things the good ones. It showed how getting a brace wasn't the end of the world.My favorite character was Deenie's father. He always stood up for Deenie and listened to her. Even though he gets strickter when Deenie gets the brace, it's because he wants her to get well.My favorite scene is when Helen (Deenie's sister) and Deenie are in the kitchen yelling at their mother. They come closer as sisters at that point and fully start to understand each other.What I didn't like about the book was the ending. I absoluty hated it! It wasn't sad or anything ,but Judy Blume just left me hanging there at the end.One question I have after reading this book is: Why did Buddy just come up to Deenie in the movie theater and put his arm around her and hold her hand? I thought she said he never noticed her.I recommend this book because it's a very touching story and I think every girl should read it. It shows what's really important in life and that looks aren't everything."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I recommend this book for readers 12 years and older because it is for girls who are starting to take care of themselves and start to develop and change. I think they will understand what has happening to Deenie. I think that the author is trying to say that everyone has problems and you are not the only one.\\" When we left Dr.Kliners office I was wearing the brace with Helen's skirt and shirt crying over it. I was kind of scared that ma would start crying again when she saw me. Instead she said, 'Well that's not bad at all. You can hardly tell you're wearing it, Deenie.' \\" I also recommend this book is because people can change. At the end of the story Deenie thinks she needs to bring a change of clothes and change out of the brace but she realizes that that she can have a good time with it. \\"Daddy called for me at eleven - thirty and as I got into the car he asked me what was in the shopping bag. I told him, 'something I thought I might need for the party&#65533;that I didn't needed, after all.' \\" If you are a young girl and you are going through this kind of change, this would be a good book for you."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I read this book in 4th grade- and I remember all of it, and I'm going into 8th grade. In 6th grade, I found out I had scoliosis, and it was so bad that I needed surgery to fix it. When I went to my orthopaedic doctor for the first time before my surgery, he recommended this book to me. I told him I'd already read it. Back braces have improved since then, but that's not the point. This book is about a girl in 7th grade who finds out she has scoliosis and has to wear a back brace. Remember, if you are someone who wears a brace or you're about to get one, they are not as bad as the book describes them. Scoliosis or not, read this book."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I read this book 29 years ago on the recommendation of my doctor. I was 10 years old and in NYU hospital ready to under go scoliosis surgery. I had worn an ugly, bulky brace from my chin to me hips for 8 months but ended up needing the surgery. It was great to read a book that struck such a chord at a hard time. It was good to know that I wasn't the only kid going through such a thing. If you know a kid who has scoliosis, this is a great book. How often, at that age (9 - 13) do we actually get to read a book that could be written about us and what we are actually going through at that moment?"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie was an awesome book by Judy Blume because it had regular teenage feelings but more importantly, Deenie had scoliosis, which is the curve of the spine. She must wear a Millwakee brace for 4 years to correct her curve. I have scoliosis too, and I was glad to see a famous author had written about it. It was a very heartwarming book and you really got to know Deenie. I would defenitly recomend it for readers of all ages who need a little inspiration in their lives.P.S. It's a very quick and easy read, but still has a rich plot and juicy descriptions.Deenie"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I love Judy Blumes books because I can always relate to them.My friend Lilly has to were a brace.Shes always moody now and it gets annyoning at times.When I read this book I sorta understood why Lilly gets moody and angry.I recommened it for her and now we have something to talk about and she dosn't feel like a totally loser wearing it.She still gets moody but now I can talk to her and more get the evil eye."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie was an excellent book. Deenie, a beautiful young girl whose mother has her life worked out to be a model, discovers that she has scoliosis. Everyone has always thought that she has walked a little funny, but nothing to be worried about. Deenie's life changes dramatically. Deenie must wear a Missisippi Brace for the next three years, and has no hope for modeling. School, her friend's attitudes towards her, her everyday activities...all change. Deenie must learn to cope with and accept her diesease and her changed life. A reccommended book for girls between 10 and 13 while learning to accept who you are."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I really loved this book. You learn a lot about scoliosis and you connect with deenie in a lot of ways. Lile your feelings and emotions."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie is a 14 year old girl that attends Adam Junior High School. She's down to earth and she's friendly at that. The problem Deenie has is that she has Scolosis and she has to wear a brace. Wearing the brace holds her back from doing what she wants to do. It also holds her back from wearing what she wants to wear. Will Deenie just give up on everything or will she pull through?This book makes you want to keep reading non-stop. Thats why i continued reading this book. Just imagine your mom forcing you to do something you really don't care about. Well guess what that's how Deenie's mom is. Her name is Thelma and to me I think she's a witch. You will too if you read this book. It's like all Thelma cares about is Deenie becoming a model. Deenie won't be able to become a model until 4 years go by because that's how long she has to wear the brace. I felt bad for Deenie because it's like her mom doesn't care for Deenie all she care's about is the modeling thing. This book can happen in real life. I'm just lucky i don't have a mom that forces me to do things I don't want to do except finish school and go to college."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie was a book I could really relate to. I'm going to be geting a brace in two days, so it helped to read \\"Deenie\\", It really touched me, the way I could relate so much. And during the fitting, I had to do some uncomfortable things too. I would say, that any girl with scoliosis, and has to wear s brace should read this book. It helped me alot."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie, a young woman who strives to be a model comes down with scolosis. When I was a young girl this was one of my favorite books.

She has to learn you don't always get want you want right away. And life comes with struggles.

She loves being with her friends and doing normal things that a 14 year old would do. But the only problem is her mom. Her mom has practically planned out her whole life! Her mom wants Deenie to be a model and be in magazines etc. But Deenie just doesn't want that. She wants to be a normal girl. When Deenie goes to a modeling agency, she gets rejected because of the way she walks and her posture. The problem is she slouches. Also, Deenie does not make the cheerleading squad because of the same reasons she was rejected from the modeling agency. Finally, Deenie goes to a doctor. After going to 3 doctors, she finds out she has scoliosis. To improve her scoliosis, she must wear a Milwaukee Brace. DEENIE DOES NOT WANT TO WEAR THE HIDEOUS MILWAUKEE BRACE WHICH GOES FROM HER HIPS TO HER NECK! Even though she doesn't want to, she still has to. Deenie has to deal with wearing her brace, her friends and other peoples reactions and much more. This is the worst time for Deenie to get a brace. It's while she's interested in boys and has many questions about herself.This is a book worth getting!"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"When I read Dennie, i thought it was a great book because I have Scoliosis.

When she went to see the doctor, he told her that she had scoliosis, and her mother didn't want to accept that her daughter had that problem. She did it worse to Dennie. What I liked about this book it's that eventhou Dennie had to wear a brace, she didn't lose what she wanted, her boyfriend. Many people might suffer of this problems, and Dennie is a good example of how to keep going foward and not stopping for such a thing."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I am a normal young adult, someone who loves to read books about other people my age's life. Judy Blume has been one of my favorite authors since I read some of her books in first grade. A few weeks ago on a vacation and finished it in one day.

When I ended up also having to wear a Milwaukee brace for three years, eight months, three weeks, and one day, I read this book again. It helped me so much. I was able to better handle my situation, in part due to this book. I have already had it special ordered for my children. I think Judy Blume is an incredible author with a detailed understanding of children's issues. Thank you for helping me through one of the toughest things I had to deal with."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I read this when I was in 5th or 6th grade when 2 of my friends had to get braces for their scoliosis and I wanted to understand what they were going through. My 11 yr old stepdaughter is an exquisite pixie with mild Cerebral Palsy that fortunately only affects her walk and left arm. Instead of helping her become independent, her own mom does everything for her, makes her decisions and tells her what to think and do. She is about to begin middle school where suddenly she will be mixed with kids who haven't known her since kindergarten and who will notice her gait first and her beautiful face and lovely demeanor last. She longs to have short hair because she physically cannot care for her long fine tresses that her mother will not allow her to cut. I hope my stepdaughter takes some inspiration from Deenie to prove to her mom and everyone she meets that she is neither her gait nor her hair, but a loving, sensitive young lady who can make up her own mind about who she is and what she will become."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie is a beatiful girl who just wants to be normal.

But not at the right timeing of course, right when Bud and her where becoming more than friends.I found this a awesome book,but it should not be read by anyone under 12yrs.old.It's good for girls 12 to 14 because some of the desions and actions between the boys and the girls are a little intence. I did not agree with everything in this book because it was not always realistic and if it is it should not be incouraged. But it does have some postive accepects to it, like the way Deenie resecpts her father and is honsest about most things. After all it is a good book to help girls know there not alone."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Recently, upon learning that my 10 year old daughter has a severe case of scoliosis, I started looking for a chapter book to read to her at bedtime that might help her relate to another girl with scoliosis. However, this book was a bad choice and I'm disappointed in myself that I didn't research the book more before selecting it for my daughter.While reading this book with her at bedtime, I found myself needing to skip over large sections. Deenie frequently refers to \\"touching herself\\" in her \\"special place\\". There is also a couple pages where they discuss masturbation in a health class at school, and Deenie asks her sister about \\"What does sexual intercourse feel like\\"? I had to skip chapter 20 completely, although I think there were a couple of valuable lessons in that chapter about friendhsip. The majority of the rest of the chapter was them talking about sex!As far as the issue of scoliosis is addressed, I don't think there were any benefits to reading this book were worth the negative content. Maybe if my child was in high school I would be comfortable with her reading this book, but even at that time I just don't think it is necessary to include that type of content in a book like this. I didn't expect this type of thing from Judy Blume. She is a popular name, and I remember reading Fudge-a-Mania, Super Fudge and Freckle Juice when I was young, so I thought it was a trustworthy name."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie is my favorite book in the world. I read this before I got scoliosis and then again and again. It is a very good book and I wish it were available on Kindle as an ebook."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I found &quot;Deenie&quot; to be endless. The beginning of it was O.K. but the end of it was blunt. It doesn't tell what happens to her or how her future turns out.

At first, I was very upset about it, and among other things my mom gave me the book Deenie. After reading it, I was even more upset. Scoliosis wasn't a big part of my life at all. All of my friends knew, and didn't care. My brace was completely covered and undetected under my clothes. But after reading this book, for the first time I felt different. For the first time, I felt like I was different and had a handicap, and I didn't want other people to veiw me that way. I still play sports, go to parties and hang out with my friends. Now I only have to wear the brace at night, but even when I first got my brace my parents allowed many acceptions when I didn't have to wear it. I found this book unrealistic and offensive, and it generally made me feel bad about myself."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"...so if you thought that what's written in the book is what that scoliosis girls have to go throught now- luckily, you're wrong.This book is nice, but I didn't really like it. First, Deenie is overreacting to her Brace (To cut off all your hair? pliz...). Second, none of the characters looks realistic- I found them mostly annoying. I didn't like the writing of the book, which made me so...bored.I don't really recomand this book, but the subject is important- there're a lot of scoliosis girls, and there's allmost no book about it."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I was so glad to have my daughter read Judy Blume's books reading most of the reviews. the reality is, tough, that unless you want to explain some VERY adult concepts, make sure you don't order this author's books. maybe they should be re-classified from 9-12 age group to something older"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"First of all, I have a friend with scoliosis and she wears a brace, although it is nothing like the one described in Deenie. It is about 3/4 of an ich think semi-rigid fiber glass that goes around the chest from under the arms to the waist and attached in the from with three velcro straps. *Sometimes* she needs to buy *one* size larger than normal, bit you never notice anything unusual about her. Ms. Blume should have done her research and gotten the facts correct befor wrining this. Consulting with a *real* doctor would have been a good idea.Also, too much about sex. I hope young pre-teens don't read this and think that is how normal tennagers act. We don't. Trust me."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I do not get this book at all. Somebody needs to explain it to me because it deals with stuff that young readers really don't need to know about. Masturbating isn't something that should be wrote about fictionaly in books and this one has it written all over it. I can't beleive the overall rating on this book. Pleaple need to realize that it's just not socially excepted."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"A really good book about a really young chick who finds out that she has a spine deformanation while trying to deal with the stress of her mom pushing at her to be a model.

I myself have scoliosis, and have had it for almost 8 years. Throughout all 8 years, I've worn a back brace. This book hopefully taught thousands of young girls what it's actually like to wear a hard plastic contraption that you can barely move in, let alone complete function in for 23 hours out of the day! Judy Blume tastefully hinted to girls the real terrors and fears of wearing a brace to school and having people want to know all about it, which hopefully let kids see through the eyes of a scoliosis patient. I just want to give a big thanks to Blume for writing this book, and I eagerly await the movie Deenie!

You know that you have the looks, but it seems that every time you find a modeling agency, you get turned down. \\"Its something about your posture\\" they say. One day you get called down to the gym to meet with your teacher. She asks you to bend down and touch your toes. You wonder what is going on, when she says, \\"You might think about going to the doctor. I'm not sure about anything, but I think you might have a problem.\\" So you go to the doctor, and he sends you to another doctor. It ends up that you have scolioses and you have to where a big, ugly, obvious brace for four years. You want to kill yourself. This is what happened to Deenie. Her whole High School years are ruined by one stupid brace. She gets all these looks at school and all of a sudden, she is treated differently. She hates it. she wants to get a operation, but the doctor says \\"Things could go wrong. Plus you would be crippled for months,\\". She is so embarrassed, but she learns to live through it, and in the end, she is glad she coped. I really liked this book because Judy Blume really gets into the brain of Deenie.

It has given me insperation for life."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"The relationships between Deenie and her mother, father, and sister are very well thought-out. I admit I was scandalized when I first read this book in seventh grade at the makeout scene between Deenie and Buddy, but it certainly didn't encourage me to go out and do that myself, and as for masturbation, Blume is VERY VAGUE and merely wishes to point out that this is normal, which it is, as any two-year-old could tell you if two-year-olds could talk well enough. People who want this book banned on a couple of minor details are missing the whole point of the book, which is about a teenager who is trying to do the right thing amidst a whole lot of physical and emotional barriers. A good read."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"When I first found out I had scoliosis one of the first things my mother did was give me a copy of this book. The book Deenie is about a thirteen year old girl who was thinking about becoming a model when she learns that she, beautiful Deenie has scoliosis. Judy Blume so accuratly described the feelings and emotions of Deenie that it felt as though she was writing about me. Untill I had read this book I felt as if I was the only one going through this even though doctors had told me there were other girls my age with scoliosis. This was such an excellent book that the only time I could put it down was to wipe the tears from my eyes. This is the perfect book for any girl especially one who has scoliosis."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"\\"Deenie\\" piqued my curosity since it appears regularly on the ALA \\"Frequently Challenged\\" list, and even in my home county library there is a note in the catalog saying, \\"No copies available in any library.\\" I was able to buy the book easily enough, however, and after reading it, I find the challenges groundless and saddening. There is nothing to fear in \\"Deenie.\\" If I had a daughter, I would have no trouble letting her read it, and as it is, I wouldn't stop my son either.That being said, \\"Deenie\\" is no \\"Face on the Milk Carton.\\" The characters are painted believeablty with a surprising economy, but just as they become really engaging, the book ends. I would like it better if we were able to follow Deenie through all four years of her treatment and observe more of her character development, see how the relationship between Deenie and her sister develops, and see if her mother is able to \\"grow up\\" a little more.For perhaps the most interesting irony of the story is that Deenie's confinement in the Milwaukee brace really sets her free. Free from her selfish and domineering mother, free from the enculturated stereotypes that keep Deenie from talking to (or even looking at) any people with visible health issues, and free from virtually all of her social inhibitions. In many ways, her diagnosis is the best thing that could have happened. It becomes the catalyst for her development as an independent young woman, and not just the daughter of her parents.There is also a lot of material in this little book for further discussion and study. Blume manages to cover the details of scoliosis without becoming too stiff, and provides resources for more current information. The relationships between Deenie and her two friends is subtly nuanced; an amazing achievement, considering how few sentences are devoted to them. Blume has an eye for detail, and is able to get the most out of the short scenes. Finally, Deenie's father provides a sterling example of good parenting, once he rises to the occasion, illustrating admirably when to yield and when to stand firm.While \\"Deenie\\" is not as impressive an achievement as \\"The Face on the Milk Carton\\" or \\"The Pigman,\\" it is certainly a worthwhile read. There is no reason that it should be suppressed: I plan to write a letter to my community library, and I would encourage otheres to stand up against such cowardly censorship in their communities as well.P.S. I contacted my local librarian, who assured me that the catalog listing was misleading. In fact, there were at least four copies in circulation, although the one at my local branch seemed to have disappeared. Certainly, this is good news, but I was really touched by how enthusiastic she was about my concern. I was rather afraid of being treated like a crackpot. I think I'll sign up for some volunteer work the next time I've over there..."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"This book was about a girl who's a teenager and has a wonderful life until one day at school she goes to school like normal, and she's at PE. Her PE. teacher asked her to bend over to see her back and she thinks something is wrong with her back. The next time she goes to the docter and finds out that she has a back problem with her spine. It wasn't staight, and at the end she ends up having to wear a brace and she doesn't like that idea. So her freinds cheer her up about it and everything, and she feels so sad and doesn't want a brace at all. She goes home to find her mom and dad fighting about her brace and that makes her feel even more upset. When she gets the brace everyone tries to make her feel good.......but, you will have to read it all!!! Its like a diary of a girl, and it's a really sad and true story!!!!!I recommend this book to everyone who loves to read diarys about people's life and everything they have to go through. I enjoy all of Judy Blume's books, and this one is especially good."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I read Deenie a few months ago because my mom told me I should. She thought I could relate to Deenie because I have scoliosis as well and some say I could be a model. People tell me I'm beautiful and tall (I don't always agree). However when I got scoliosis in 7th grade and had to wear a brace, most everything in my life was changed and my dreams were put on hold. Even though it's not a barrier to my friendships, my goals, or my schoolwork, I still feel very different from everyone else. I don't consider myself to be disabled at all. I can do anything. I may have a brace but I also have a life, friends, a family, and my goals. Deenie feels this way also. I would recommend this book to anyone who has trouble accepting themselves or who just would like to read a good book."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Deenie is a beautiful seventh grader whose mother desperately wants her to be a model. Deenie doesn't really know if she wants to be a model, but goes along with her mother's wishes so as not to rock the boat. Whenever she goes on modeling interviews, they seem to always comment about her posture, which makes her mother angry. Deenie promises that she will begin working on her posture. When her school gym teacher notices that Deenie's posture is a problem, she notifies Deenie's parents who take her to a specialist. It turns out that Deenie has adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and that she will have to wear a brace to correct it. So much for her modeling career.In the tradition of most Judy Blume books, Deenie tackles many issues that teenage girls face. Deenie's mother is constantly harping on her looks and the hopes that she had for Deenie to become a successful model, whether Deenie wanted to or not. She is a typical stage mom who puts both of her daughters into very specific roles: Helen is the brains, Deenie is the beauty. When things don't work out the way that she plans, she takes her frustration out on Deenie. In turn, Deenie wonders if the disease is her fault.Deenie also has to deal with the issue of being self-conscious about something that is really outside of her control. At the beginning of the novel she focuses on others' deformities: a girl with eczema, which Deenie refers to as \\"creeping crud,\\" is avoided because of her red and flaky skin; Deenie never makes eye contact with a woman who has a hunchback until her own spine malformation is noticed. Deenie is a story about growing up and maturing, and the change in Deenie from start to finish is evident.Unfortunately, for some, Judy Blume also tackles teenage sexuality in this novel, which has caused it to be one of the most challenged works of young adult fiction. Personally, I felt the references were mild at best, and completely appropriate. Deenie mentions touching herself as a way of feeling better when things spiral out of control. The subject of teenage masturbation is handled with tact and elegance, and I think people just make more out of it than they should.As a whole, Deenie was an excellent book, and one I never got a chance to read when I was younger. I'm glad I picked it up now, and can honestly say that it has a lot of good messages for young adults. If you can look past the mild sexual references to the heart of the story, a young girl who has to learn to look past exteriors to see inner beauty--including her own--I think you'll enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"...and for 13 year-old Deenie Fenner, it seems as if life couldn't get any worse. When she sees the brace for the first time, her brain churns with thoughts. \\"I won't wear it. Never!\\" she says to herself adamantly. Deenie can't imagine wearing the brace, let alone living normally in it. Even more distraught over the situation is Mrs. Fenner, Deenie's mother, who had high hopes for her daughter's career as a model.For as long as Deenie can remember, she has been the beauty of the family. Her mother considers Deenie's good looks to be a precious gift that will help her to get far in life. Helen, Deenie's older sister, is known as being the smartest of the two. I get the impression Mrs. Fenner is a bit shallow. She pays less attention to Helen than she does Deenie, all because Deenie is endowed in the looks department. Mrs. Fenner drags her daughter to countless modeling agencies, searching for work. She lives vicariously through her daughter. \\"You're going to work somewhere where they pay you, not where you pay them,\\" she says.Mrs. Fenner is really no help with Deenie's scoliosis, a.k.a. curvature of the spine. Fortunately, Deenie has two wonderful friends. At first, when Deenie finds out about her back problems, she's sure doctors will need to operate. When she gives her friends the news, they go out to the nearest department store and buy her a cute pink nightgown to wear at the hospital.Deenie's scoliosis doesn't require surgery - just a brace for four years or more. Deenie sees she'll have to change the way she eats. She cannot lean over to eat soup or take a bite out of a sandwich, as she soon finds out. She can't wear the same clothes - she needs to move up a size so they fit over her brace. \\"Damn you crooked spine!\\" she shrieks before whacking off her beautiful hair with a pair of scissors.As I'm sure you can imagine, Mrs. Fenner is not pleased.Still, those who truly care for Deenie for more than just selfish reasons do stick by her. Her best friends stay by her side and don't act any differently towards her. Buddy Brader, an eighth grader, still doesn't hide his interest in Deenie, despite the brace and wacky new hairdo.Blume has written yet another realistic novel with likeable, believable characters that many readers can relate to. Nothing in Blume's books ever seem contrived or fake. Things happen as they would in honest-to-God true life and the endings are never sugar-coated, sappy, or overly happy - just straight up real. And that, I do believe, is why America's youth has enjoyed her writing for decades."},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 years old. It was the first time that I felt anyone in the world understood how I felt as a young teen with Scoliosis. Even though Deenie is a girl, her emotions and experiances mirrored mine as I dealt with wearing the cumbersome Milwaukee brace for 23 hours a day.Thank you Judy!"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"This book was the first clue I recieved that I was not alone in my affliction with scoliosis. I read it over 19 years ago for the first time. I was the only person I knew of that had this dreaded abnormality. Up until I read &quot;Deenie&quot;, I felt like a freak, literally. Most of the kids in school had already labeled me as &quot;retarded&quot; because of my cumbersome back-brace. I was diagnosed with scoliosis in the fifth grade, and from that point until the end of my freshman year of high school, I was cursed with my brace 24/7. My story seemed so much like Deenie's that throughout the book, I cried with her. Deenie and I share so many similarities that it seemed astounding to me at the time, and still does. Deenie's story could very well have been my own. Deenie still seems to me like an old friend that helped me through a very rough time in my life, even after all these years. &quot;Deenie&quot; has made such an impact in my life and in the way I view my affliction that I would strongly reccomend it to sufferers and their families of ALL ages. (Even though there are graphic sexual references, I still feel that the book helped me [at age 11] too much to corrupt me.) Thank you Judy Blume!!!!!

It is a story of a young girl whose mother raised her telling her she belonged on the cover of magazines. She was destined to be a model and her sister was the smart one. Although Deenie does not appear to be mean to others, she certainly does not go out of her way to be nice to people that are \\"beneathe her.\\" While in the process of trying to become a model, it is noted that she has scoliosis. This news is very heartbreaking for Deenie, but almost more so for her mother. She is placed in a Milwaukee Brace and needs to wear it for four years in order to treat and fix her spine issues. During the time of her transition to wearing the brace Deenie starts to see people in a different light. She starts to see more of the person behind the disability, rather then always the negative.My daughter is only 10, so I'm not quite ready for her to read about masterbation or making out with boys (which or both talked about fairly modestly in the book). I do, however, plan to have her read it in another year or two so she can get the main concepts that Judy Blume tries to convey. Seeing past the disability or the thing that makes someone different and really looking at the person behind the disability is an invaluable lesson for all preteens and teens to learn.By Kerri J.

I also wrote about what my sister had suffered. The book was similar to my sister's experience in a lot of ways.

(Not that the others weren't great books.) Deenie's mother wants her to be a model, do movies perhaps. But Deenie would rather go to the mall with her friends and try makeup on and not buy it. But instead, Deenie goes to different modeling agencies every Saturday. Deenie tries out for cheerleading and is told a call will be sent home. The teacher tells Deenies parents that she needs to see a doctor. Then, after seeing 3 doctors, Deenie and her family relize that she has scoliosis (a crooked spine) and must wear a brace from her neck to her hips. Deenie knows things will never be the same. Who would hire a model with a brace from her head to her hips? How can Deenie ever make cheerleder with a brace? Deenie soon relizes that she must find a way to get trough all the hard times ahead. But how?"},{"Title":"Deenie","review":"Judy Blume's, Deenie is an interesting book. At some points the book gets confusing, but for the most part, it can sure keep you reading. The theme of the book doesn't really come out until the end. There are several different characters to remember the roles of and it also changes scenes frequently. Deenie, a typical seventh-grader, is described as beautiful and perfect. Her mother, Thelma, tries forcing her into becoming a model, which Deenie really isn't interested in, but tries to keep her mother happy by seeing different agencies. Deenie goes behind her mother's back and tries out for the middle school cheerleading squad. Unfortunately she doesn't make it, but one of her best friends, Janet, does. She didn't quite understand why she didn't make it but goes on with her life. A few days later Thelma receives a telephone call from the cheerleading coach. I will leave it up to you to figure out what happens from this point on. I am not one who enjoys reading, but I enjoyed this book a lot. I think that I enjoyed it so much because it is about a teenage girl and how she might be a model. I would recommend this book to young teenage girls.

His writing is inspired, humane, incisive, and exhilarating. No one else tackle's Shakespeare consciousness the way Goddard does. A great book to read before advancing to The Mysterious William Shakespeare (see my review)."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"A very good book of criticism, indeed. Especially appreciate Professor Goddard's emphasis on the role of IMAGINATION in both the reading of Shakespeare and Shakespeare's creation of his own works. However, Professor Goddard's own practice fails this spirit. First, in his discussion of Shakespeare, you find, here and there, ever so often, a sentence or two whose syntax is rigid and academic. Second, his discussion of some of Shakespeare's individual plays, his discussion of \\"Hamlet,\\" for instance, bogs down into too many minutiae and gets tiresome. His goal is to be exhaustive, I know. So the upshot is that those discussions are written by a pedant rather than an inventive and forceful critic he has called on the world to be. His complaints of other critics' readings of the play come across as \\"this pedant doth protest too much.\\" :)For a book whose prose consistently flies and whose content consistently vital, I recommend the Chinese philosopher, Zhuang Zi. But you'll have to read the Chinese original to get the flavor. :)Professor Goddard's book is still a good one, despite the ironic failings I have found."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"Other writers about Shakespeare have tried to equal Goddard's labor of love, most recently Harold Bloom's Shakespeare: The Art of the Human. None come close, although Jan Kott's Shakespeare Our Contemporary is also great, as is Allan Bloom's Shakespeare's Politics. In fact, Goddard makes Harold Bloom's effort look like it was written by a boy.Goddard writes thoughtful, highly readable, analytic essays about each of the plays. His interpretations are the most original, but well-argued I've ever seen. Yet they frequently deviate from traditional interpretations. For example, Goddard makes a case against the much-loved, jingoistic interpretation of Henry V; Goddard reads much darker implications. In his essay about Romeo and Juliet, Goddard argues that the play is not about star-crossed lovers, but about Romeo's inability to match Juliet's love, which is the real source of tragedy.It's hard to disagree once you've read Goddard's interpretations, but even when you do, you'll be richer for the experience.For those of you interested in &quot;old-fashioned&quot; literary criticism, when writers considered it their duty, not to obscure the text or to deconstruct it, but to make difficult works more accessible, than this is for you. This is a purchase you will never regret."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"This first volume covers Shakespeare up to Hamlet. For later plays, see volume two. In my opinion, Goddard is by far the best critic of Shakespeare's plays. He far outranks Bloom, who seems to be the popular Shakespeare critic these days. Goddard gets to the heart of the characters and stories without being sidetracked by modern ideologies and -isms. He doesn't try to distort the plays for something they are not.I particularly love the comedies of Shakespeare and Goddard gives them the attention they deserve that other critics don't. His insight into these lighter works are quite interesting. If you are more interested in Shakespeare's tragedies rather than his comedies or histories, you should get volume two instead, however I recommend getting both.As for the writing style, it is very enjoyable and not at all scholarly or incomprehensible. Actually I've read both volumes over and over, and I consider them to be a few of the best books in my library. They are a must have for Shakespeare fans."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"It can be put quite simply--this book must be considered within the tradition of Wisdom Literature. It stands on it's own apart from the plays it interprets and analyses. It is a pleasure and joy to read on its own merits. Goddard speaks and you must listen. You may hold contrary opinions about certain plays and characters, but you will not disagree with him. His essays are full of his 40 odd years of teaching but his voice is that of an intimate, not one of the classroom. Buy both volumes and keep them on your bedside table."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"Professor Goddard provides a fresh understanding of the Shakespeare plays, sonnets and poems that you will not find in most college courses or in other books of Shakespeare criticism. Don't miss this! Here is a man who taught, read and reflected on the Shakespeare plays, sonnets and poems for years and years and came to some global conclusions as to what they all mean. He even concludes that the meaning of all of Shakespeare is summarized in two lines from one of the sonnets (I'll let you discover this for yourself!). Be sure to notice that there are two paperbacks, volume one and volume two. The current publisher has split the original hardback edition into the two paperback volumes, so you really need both of these volumes. Different plays and poems are covered in each volume."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"There's not much praise I can add to that offered by earlier reviewers. Goddard is, for me, one of the premier Shakespeare critics -- up there with Johnson, Coleridge, Bradley, and Frye. I much prefer his work to that of the two popularist contemporary critics, Bloom and Garber. Goddard lacks, thankfully, the self-aggrandizement of Bloom and Garber; his criticism is insightful and brilliant while remaining extremely accessible and enjoyable to read.The two volumes of The Meaning of Shakespeare should be on the reading table (don't let them linger on the shelves) of every reader who respects and wants to enjoy Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"I once knew a young man who thought Polonius was a wise and noble character. He had taken Polonius's advice, such as \\"brevity is the soul of wit,\\" at face value without noticing the irony that Polonius is not brief himself, and is in fact a meddling old fool. Reading Goddard makes me feel like that young man; he shows that Shakespeare's subtle irony is far more extensive than most theater-goers and readers realize. For example, whereas conventional wisdom holds Henry V to be Shakespeare's ideal king, Goddard interprets Henry V as the portrait of a hypocritical strongman.If Goddard has a fault, he is too contemptuous of the theater. He sees the audience as an unthinking mob that laps up surface effects. His Shakespeare gave the groundlings the cheap thrills they crave so he could make money, but used irony to tell a poetic truth that was sometimes the opposite of what is seen on the stage. I think Shakespeare loved the theater more than Goddard did. Without the brilliant drama and comedy, his plays would be read as much as \\"The Rape of Lucrece,\\" which is to say, only by scholars and devotees of Renaissance poetry. Even so, Goddard's insights are a revelation. After reading this book, you will have a greater appreciation of Shakespeare's artistic integrity."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"Wow, thought I was the only adult fan of Shakespeare who watches the plays and then runs home to read what insights Goddard has into 'em -- guess not, from these reviews.Each chapter -- essay -- is like an evening by the fireside with a scholarly, opinionated friend interested in exploring ideas rather than summarizing a plot or proving his erudition.Special applause to Goddard's essay (Vol.1) on Henry V: his quite negative take on Henry's character -- for which, as he points out, all the evidence is right there in the text -- made the play much more subtle and so more interesting for me.Volume one (brown cover) has many of the histories and tragedies; Volume two (blue cover) has everything else. I recommend them both, but if you're looking just for Goddard's essay on one particular play, choose the \\"look inside the book\\" option for viewing the cover -- it lists the plays covered inside."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"I don't know much about Shakespeare, but I know great writing when I read it.

He breaks down the importance (i.e. meaning) of the more important characters by utilizing chunks of text and his own opinions. Though the language can get a bit confusing (very professorial), he makes clear observations on the plays and characters. I found the book very helpful when playing Henry V and Rosalind."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Shakespeare Vol. 1","review":"One of my favorite books -- I return to it again and again. Most books on Shakespeare, it seems, get bogged down in the meanings of words, the supposed worldview of the Elizabethans, the history of stage production, and other such dryness. What a bore! This book is different. From the very beginning, Goddard takes us right to the depths of Shakespeare's characters and plots. He reveals Shakespeare as not only a great linguist and playwright but as an oracle of Man's Place in the Universe. He often takes controversial positions but backs them up with very careful attention to the text. What I have said may seem grandiose, but I think that if you read this book you'll agree with me."},{"Title":"How to Care for Your Pet Bird: Practical Advice by Dr. Murphy","review":"This is the most educational book I have ever read on thecare and breeding of psittacine birds (parakeets, cockatiels,macaws etc.).

Once the elder Mr. Hartwell passed away, her world came crashing down upon her. It didn't help matters that Mr. Hartwell's only child, forest ranger David Hartwell, came into her life like a whirlwind and upset everything in his path. Not only did he expect her to leave the isolation of the mountain she called home, but he stirred up feelings in her she had never felt before.David Hartwell was used to women cringing once they looked at his face. Scarred in an accident as a teen, he had given up on most human interaction and generally liked to keep to himself. He was content to be a loner for most of the time, but now his father's pesky will insisted that he take care of Ellen until she had her upcoming surgery that may restore her sight. So now he had to share his life with a woman he thought had been his father's mistress...and face the feelings that she evoked in him, longings for a family and a wife that he might never have fulfilled. He was afraid to get too close to Ellen, but as she blended in with the small mountain community David now called home, he wondered if he could bear to have her leave.This book was pretty good. Neither of the characters were perfect; David had enough emotional baggage for a dozen people, and Ellen also had her own emotional hang-ups. Sometimes they rubbed each other the wrong way - but as you read the book, you could see both Ellen and David grow in character strength and depth. This book was a refreshing break from perfect people falling perfectly in love with no major obstacles in their way. David was initially rough, Ellen was initially weak, but watching David soften and allow people into his heart, and Ellen gaining strength and independence she'd never had before...let's just say, I definitely got my money out of this book :)There were a few rough patches, and a few parts when I thought David was a bit cruel when he dealt with Ellen...but altogether, a lovely book that not only shows the depth of human emotions, but allows you to experience them as you read this book. Definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Down from the Mountain","review":"Barbara Gale writes a book that pulls you in and doesn't allow you to put it down until you reach the end. This book has excellent character detail and insight into how much baggage a person can bring to their lives and relationships. Some of the information is simplistic, yet the characters are well written. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Down from the Mountain","review":"I wish I could re write this book myself!I was so looking forward to a tender, sweet love story. Instead I was so disappointed. The heroine is way to eager to jump into bed with a man she says she doesn't like and the hero was just plain mean.What a disappointment! I could have done a better job writing this one.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Down from the Mountain","review":"First, let me say that there are good things about this book. The hero and heroine are types (wounded hero/blind heroine) that I normally like. The cast of secondary characters is superb and well-drawn. The resolution of Ellen's surgery was surprising (and unusual for a romance novel). And, individually, I felt for the two main characters and enjoyed seeing them both come \\"down from the mountain\\" as the book progressed.What I didn't always get was how they acted towards each other. David's high-handed treatment of Ellen at the beginning really set him far behind the power curve. He essentially kidnaps her--an over-21 adult--and treats her scornfully with no real reason for doing so. He runs out with her in the middle of the night, not allowing her to pack her things, blowing off a meeting with the lawyer the next day, and takes her the whole way across the country, and then leads her to believe that she'll be living in squallor. His behavior after her surgery was fairly unforgivable. His angst, while understandable, is so over-the-top that it makes me wonder how he had been able to function--the get through college and grad school and a job--for the past decade.Ellen was more sympathetic, though I had to wonder how she had come to the point where she was living as a recluse. Some additional explanation would have helped--it is clear that she was the product of over-protective parents and an over-protective guardian, but there seems to have been no effort made by those people to make her self-sufficient and no resentment on her part or desire to break free.That said, the big issue I had with this book was with the writing itself. I found myself constantly pulled out of the story because of the way things were worded (such as author's intrusion/explanation--\\"she couldn't have known that he thought...\\"--into a character's POV and POV that shifted from one character to the next so that you had to figure out whose brain you were in before figuring out what, exactly, was going on) and because of a meandering timeline. Was she with his father 6 years? 10 years? From when she was 17? From when she was 12? Was it 15 years since his accident? 20? It seemed to be constantly changing, to the point where it became intrusive.So, 3 stars because, overall--it was a fairly enjoyable read and doesn't deserve less than that--but with reservations as noted."},{"Title":"Down from the Mountain","review":"Down from the Mountain by Barbara GaleSilhouette Special Edition # 1595 - February 2004It has been years since David had been to his family home in the Montana mountains. He hadn't known his father was ill and news came too late for him to even attend the funeral. This homecoming has more surprises because there to greet him is Ellen, a beautiful young blind woman who seems to have been very close with his father, so close she's inherited half of the estate. There's even more surprises as the will is read. David's father has ordered David to be Ellen's caretaker until her scheduled surgery to restore her sight, that's four months away. If David refuses, neither he nor Ellen will inherit. David's a bitter man. The reason he's been away so long is because of a horrendous accident when he was a teen that left him facially disfigured. He buried himself in studies at university and then took a forestry job in New York. So in order to meet his father's demands, he whisks Ellen off to his cabin in the New York forests. But David's not immune to Ellen's beauty and charm, and he soon finds himself wanting a life with her. Ellen finds David hard to understand, one moment he's arrogant and hurtful and the next he's kissing her senseless. She knows there must be something about him that he's afraid to share with her. David's afraid that when Ellen's sight is restored she'll be repulsed by his appearance so when the surgery is complete and the bandages are to be removed David deserts her in the hospital so she'll never see him.This was a very emotional story. David is a man who's tortured himself for years that no woman could ever love him. And he'd made himself almost a hermit. Ellen has a love of life and her confidence in herself is strong. Except when it comes to David. The signals he sends her are so contrary she's never sure what his moods will be. She does know that somewhere deep inside, David is a good man with a good heart. Very emotional. Very well done."},{"Title":"ECG's Made Easy","review":"This book presents the various arrythmias in a very good format. From atrial to junctional rhythms, her explanations and diagrams are very helpful and informative.My only complaint, and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I wish she would have put some sort of cardiac pharmacology table in with the text (i.e. what drugs are indicated for the various dysrhythmias)."},{"Title":"ECG's Made Easy","review":"I own many ECG books, including Taigman's Advanced Cardiology, Brady's Basic Arrhythmias, and Grauer's ACLS Arrhythmia Interpretation.

I'm currently in medic school and found that out of about 4 books that this one is best. The terminology is easy to understand. If you can't understand the information this book provides, it may be best not to try. I found the section on page 226 and 227 that gives a list of cardiac drugs, uses, and effects to be very helpful. I like that they give you several strips at the end of each chapter to try and identify as well as a post test and then provide you the answers in the back of the book. I also like that they have a chapter just on 12 lead interpretations.

There are 9 chapters and 12 lead ECG is being introduced in the last chapter! This chapter contains Myocardial Infarction and the content is so less that it is essentially useless. You get some general information on the subject. The same is the case with the rest of the subjects too, but even for that there aren't adequate tracings.If you want to have a general idea of ECG can buy this one. It gives an idea of different patterns that can be expected in many scenarios on a superficial manner ( but does not provide enough tracings to understand those). There is nothing about vectors and how the patterns of ECG occurs including the positive and the negative deflections. Also, there is inadequate information on the orientation of the heart with respect to electrodes . These are important for a person who is new to ECG, to get an idea of how the patterns occur. Even if you are looking for a concise review book for all the ECG patterns - don't buy this book, this is a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"ECG's Made Easy","review":"All thought this book is very informative, it is equally as hard to understand.

I re-read it and was still captured by the story."},{"Title":"Noah II","review":"This book rather reads like an unfinished manuscript. The premise is very interesting, and the story line is good, but there are parts that just end abruptly and situations that are set up which go nowhere. In one of the most jarring of these, a major character is introduced and developed well, then just dropped with no resolution. Other less-important characters are given a full story arc, with at least a small blurb added in to explain how they died or what became of them. Perhaps it was intended as a screenplay, with video details to fill in the holes, as the book starts out with a claim of an imminent film release...? All in all, a very good read, and though it follows the common 1960-70s \\"horrible future of man\\" dialogue, it's a more unique approach than most. Great quick read for the beach or quiet vacation weekend."},{"Title":"The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life: How to Eliminate Virtually All Risk of Heart Disease and Cancer","review":"One of the best books on the subject, if not thee best. I've read Pritikin, McDougal, Depak Shopak (spelling), Ornish, even Susan Powter, and all the others during a 1 year exhaustive search of the medical facts on heart health and disease. This is the only book I continue to recommend to absolutely everyone who wants the truth about animal fat and it's relationship to whatever ails you, from heart disease to depression. I personally have not had one single day of depression since I went completely off dairy products. Kurzweil has changed my life and it's been one of the answers I had been looking for for many years.

He goes from Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks to the part of North Carolina that reaches out under Tennessee, pointing out the highlights as well as giving a taste of the history and cultural heritage of very different places.His gentle humor works well in these pages. While talking about a sapphire mine in Franklin, for example, he explains how the owners sell tourists \\"a bucket of mud alleged to contain wondrous stones.\\"You will find more detailed books on various parts of the Tarheel State--and Mike has written a couple of those as well--but you will not find a better guidebook to the entire state."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks: North Carolina","review":"A lot of travel books can be a dry read.

Some guidebooks are like traveling with a jaded, smug know-it-all. I know the latter has some snob appeal for some people, but that's not where Mike's coming from. Reading his book is like traveling beside a more seasoned traveler who knows the destination well, and is excited to show you how special it is, as well as WHY it's special (for instance, James K.

My doctor prescribed calcium, but it wasn't until I read this book that I understood that it is much more involved than just taking calcuim. Other vitamins and minerals enhance the absorbancy of calcuim, and I was deficient in those as well. With this book, I was able to sit down and determine what I need to be supplementing with and how much. She lists food sources, functions in the body, interactions, RDA recommended usage, minimum doses, maximum doses, symptoms of deficiency, symptoms of toxicity, plus other safety information about each vitamin and mineral covered in her book. Once I knew how the vitamins and minerals are used and how they interact with each other, it all made sense. I especially liked having the information on the safe amounts of usage. I was able to use her guide to determine if I was taking a safe combination or not. (Of course you should always consult with your doctor, because as she states in her book, some medications affect the absorbancy of supplements and vise versa.)

There is also a good discussion for people who have the inherited possibility of diabetes type II and/or obseity which, while not the recent \\"method of treatment\\" (stomach stapling), it DOES describe the treatment that worked for my father, and reasons in line with known biological information.

She may be too patient and wise to be believed, and he nearly too weak, but they do get on well together. His dragon of an aunt is thoroughly conceived. All in all, a pleasant and diverting tale. 3 stars.Metzger's story is the best of the bunch, in my opinion. A delightfully convoluted &quot;wish list&quot; holds this witty and quirky tale together. Metzger's clever &quot;trick&quot; of viewing the story from multiple viewpoints with similar phrasing is delightful, is occasionally taken a bit too far. Her characters are finely drawn, especially the secondary ones. Metzger delivers. 4 stars.Kelly's offering is only so-so. It's a fairly interesting situation for the hero but is otherwise blah. There's nothing really special here, and the story is not firmly resolved. The author's style is nice, but the story is not particularly engaging, and there is a sense of it being unfinished. 1 &amp; 1/2 stars.Fairchild's piece is also less-than-wonderful. It involves a thoroughly dastardly brother and a twist of sorts. This tale is more sensual than most in such anthologies. There's some nice imagery, but it's only middling overall. 2 stars.Layton's contribution is a take on Sleeping Beauty--one that is fairly obvious and straightforward. The tale is mildly diverting, but Layton, as usual, is overly wordy, relying too much on description and on &quot;telling&quot; the story. 1 &amp; 1/2 stars.Overall, this anthology is a typical mix and few stories are worth the effort. Metzger's near the top of her form here, however, and Lane is also worth a read."},{"Title":"A Regency Christmas Present (Signet Regency Anthology): Heart's Desire/ Christmas Wish List/ An Object of Charity/ A Christmas Canvas/ The Last Gift","review":"I totally agree with Scibarfans review-the first two stories by Allison Lane and Barbara Metzger were very good, I'd give each about 4 stars, but the last three stories quickly go down hill.Surprisingly, even Carla Kelly's-whom I normally enjoy. Her story was OK-though nothing special to endear it to the reader.The last two stories by Elizabeth Fairchild and Edith Layton were unreadable, in my opinion. In fact, I'm quickly finding that Layton and Fairchild are going on my \\"do not read\\" list as they just don't do it for me.Of the five stories, like Scibarfan, I enjoyed Barbara Metzgers the best but not enough to recommend this Anthology just for that one story.

According to the dust cover, he had over half a dozen interviews (7? that must have been exhausting!) with the director himself and a handful of stars (though never really truly substantiated), but it doesn't seem like he thought about interviewing parents, siblings, co-workers, crew members, etc. for any more details or elucidations about this icon of American pop culture. His obvious admiration and fawning over his subject distracts from any possible objectivity and also grows tiresome. The book offers a basic overview of the director's life and work but not much in terms of how he works, communicates, or thinks. For example, there's almost nothing about his relationship with pivotal Amblin producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. Didn't they ever argue, or disagree about anything? How were projects brought in to the company and what was Kennedy and Marshall's thoughts about their boss? There is also no insight from production designers or cinematographers or writers or producers he worked with. For more than just a cursory look at this director's career (up to 1995) look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology","review":"I got the 1996 edition of this book from the library that is somewhat shorter than the 2002 edition. This book is a great beginning - sharing enough to get a good feel for the humanity of Spielberg.Details on the process of Schindler's List, the most impacting film I have ever experienced, I was great full to learn. Birthing the Shoa Foundation, what a magnificent thing to learn Spielberg is the catalyst, via Schindler's List. Also editing Jurassic park while shooting Schindler's, I found a powerful view of massive endurance.Of people I have studied, Churchill is one of my favorites. In the film arena I am sure Spielberg is up there with Churchill in significance. However, Churchill is a pinnacle reason Hitler failed. There are massive numbers of books on Churchill's life, some more enjoyable than others. I am sure there are many more books on Spielberg- this one is a good beginning.I caught the tail of an interview on television called \\"Spielberg on Spielberg.\\" I was \`wowed' with how tender Steven Spielberg presented himself and wanted to catch the whole piece. I could not find it anywhere. Calling my library this book was one of the few books they had. It's a great fast balance read.I generally limit my reading to biographies, history, business, and data I have involvement. This biography is refreshing and easy. I have no doubt for the volumes of actions Steven Spielberg has made- no book of roughly 300 pages can make a dent in details. This book is a fine overview.I read the critics of this book- oh well. The speed, balanced and endearing view of Steven Spielberg, a multifaceted gift to our world - this book has been well worth my time, even the 1996 edition. This book certainly reads smoother than half the biographies I've read."},{"Title":"Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology","review":"I'm not quite sure what Sanello was thinking, but his biography, SPIELBERG is the biography equivalent of a one-hit-wonder. The most significant part of the book is the first few chapters that deal with Spielberg's early life. I learned some things I didn't know before. However, I guess after Sanello finished talking with a few old friends and family, he figured that was all the real research he needed to do because the rest of the biography reads like an extended version of PEOPLE magazine. There are no juicy tidbits and no in-depth research or even assumptions about how Spielberg is able to do what he does. The few times that Sanello discusses skirmishes that Spielberg had with former cast members, a short ancedote is given about their careers after the film and that is about all. Not only that, but several times throughout the book, Sanello quotes himself verbatim from previous chapters; sounding more like a freshman college student taking Lit 101 than the famed biographer he is supposed to be. Overall, SPIELBERG was a major let down. It's worth reading for the first couple chapters about Spielberg's early days, but the rest of the novel you can read yourself in the trades, newspapers, and magazines."},{"Title":"Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology","review":"Two copies of Spielberg: The Man, The Movies, The Mythology arrived in great condition just 4 days after the order was placed on Amazon.com from this outside vendor in Pennsylvania.

The book was chosen by the professor for the course text, but was not available for purchase at the college bookstore. The ease of purchase, great condition of the books and swift delivery makes this vendor most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology","review":"THIS BOOK SUCKED. the first ten pages were worth reading the rest of the book is not.

I found that when i went to use the diagrams that the author failed to make a complete step from 1 to 2 2to 3 and so on. It would be an improvement if the author said to fold here or there with diagrams showing how to actualy do this. The pictures are more helpful than the writeing itself. You can get stuck on the very first project. I would not recommend this for beginners."},{"Title":"The Great Origami Book & Kit","review":"...my daughter (8 years old) and I have many, many origami books and this is one of the best.

I ordered the kit which included the book and the papers, and it came with a good variety of paper to use. The instructions were written very clearly and were easy for him to understand. It appears I made a good choice when I selected this item."},{"Title":"The Great Origami Book & Kit","review":"This book was clear, the paper pretty, some of the origami figures require a little imagination to figure out what they are."},{"Title":"The Great Origami Book & Kit","review":"This product looks great on the internet. Instructions are good. Supplies are limited and less than what appears to be provided."},{"Title":"The Great Origami Book & Kit","review":"I have recently been trying to add new books to my craft book collection, and since I enjoy doing origami and I've recently been getting into handmade books, I thought I'd expand my library of origami books to provide myself with ideas for page elements and cover decorations. I have been designing a large \\"first book\\" for the two year old son of one of my coworkers. Tammi and I have known one another for over a decade now, having met while we both worked on the ICU ward in our hospital. We now work on the recovery ward together. She and her husband were blessed with a child during their thirties, and no one could be a more enthusiastic Mom than she. An interactive book that she could read with her son seemed just the thing, and origami forms to illustrate it seemed a splendid and simple way to go about the project.Although I have several books in my library that include origami plants and animals they are a little on the old side (some dating to the 1960s), so I decided I'd see what new had been published. I selected three origami kits out of curiosity: Origami Made Easy by Irmagard Kneissler, Origami Jungle by Michael G. LaFosse, and The Great Origami Book and Kit, by Z&uuml;lal Ayt&uuml;re-Scheele.First let it be said that I'm all for creating innovative and attractive ways for involving more people in the fun and creativity of origami. I've done paper folding and paper crafts for almost 30 years now, and I'm still learning about the art. Kits make sense in that they provide the beginner with everything they require at a known price. One doesn't purchase a reasonable book and discover there are a dozen other things one requires that all cost a fortune. It allows the novice to pick up a kit, try a few projects and decide whether this is a hobby they would enjoy enough to go out and find new materials to try and new more sophisticated books to study.This said I also have to point out the caveat to this form of \\"boxed learning.\\" In each situation, the packaging is designed to attract the purchaser. It tells what is included and stresses that it's all you need to do the projects, some of which are displayed on the package itself. What it doesn't do-short of opening it or having an open copy available- is let the purchaser look through the book itself to see if the illustrations appear too confusing to follow, or if the projects are useful and interesting enough to bother with. Furthermore, the choice of papers included is at the whim of the designer, rather than at the discretion of the novice artist. While none of these kits is particularly expensive, I felt that the drawbacks were not negligible. Two of the three kits were deceptively large but consisted mostly of packaging designed to attract attention.Of the three books, I found the Ayt&uuml;re-Scheele the most useful for my specific project. It contained the most interesting flowers and the most recognizable animals. It also contained patterns for buildings. While a little less diverse, the Kneissler book had patterns for a cat and an owl that were quite charming, and designs for masks that were stunning (I could see doing these in large pieces of handmade paper or expensive craft paper to hang on a living room wall). The LaFosse jungle animals were a little disappointing, because they often required quite of bit of interpretation to see the animal in the folded product. Of all of them I was most impressed with the Butterfly in Book One and the Tortoise and the Arrow Frog in Book Two.On the whole, I think I'd suggest finding a book on origami and paging through it to see if the designs appeal. You might pay even more for a good book of designs than for the kit, but you'd know that the patterns were ones you would really like to try. You will also get an idea of how easy or difficult the designer's method of illustrating the folds is to understand. You can start out folding plain old xerox paper then purchase more colorful-and expensive-papers at a local craft shop when you gain more experience."},{"Title":"Jefferson Davis: A Memior by His Wife","review":"These memoirs, written by a loyal, loving wife, incorporate numerous excerpts from documents of the period, along with correspondence and more objective remembrances, to portray the life and career of Jefferson Davis in a totally absorbing book. The reader, whatever his loyalty in regard to the tragic conflict of the Civil War, will come away with a deep respect for this remarkable man."},{"Title":"Jefferson Davis: A Memior by His Wife","review":"Not unexpectedly Jefferson Davis is portayed in too heroic a light which dims the qualities he possessed. The book is written as a counterpoint to the villification Davis endured in the defeat of the Confederacy. More interesting than the testimonials to Jeff Davis's character are the pre-Civil War national and southern figures who swirl in and out of the Davis's lives. Also the book provides some insight from the slaveholders' view that the abolitionists were constantly harassing them with proposed legislation in the Congress. The book is a dry read, but I recommend to anyone interested in the pre-Civil War atmosphere. Craig Symonds's introduction errs in placing Beauvoir in Louisiana rather than rightfully in Mississippi."},{"Title":"Shanghaied in San Francisco (Maritime)","review":"Shanghaied In San Francisco details a system by which cargo ships sailing out of San Francisco were assured a full complement of sailors. Shanghaing - forcing men aboard sailing ships by essentially kidnapping them - was indeed a system, buttressed by agreements between ship captains and the crimps who supplied them with sailors, by politicians who knew that without full crews to sail the ships the city's economy would crumble, and by support within police and fire departments. Shanghaiing existed in every major port around the world, but the term originated in San Francisco from the clipper tea trade with China. When the clipper era waned, shanghaiing of sailors increased, as the city's growth brought in more trade and more ships. Bill Pickelhaupt details this colorful history with this absorbing, well-researched account. In this book you will find legendary crimps such as &quot;Shanghai Chicken&quot; Devine and &quot;Shanghai&quot; Kelly, but there is also some surprising information, such as the large number of women crimps who shanghaied sailors. The rivalry among the crimps to collect &quot;blood money&quot; for supplying men to ships was so intense, there was a case of one crimp shanghaiing a rival crimp! The author also dispels a popular myth - that much of the shanghaiing involved trap doors in saloons, where sailors fell into the hands of runners who took them out to awaiting ships. Although not entirely untrue, it was not nearly as prevalent as legend has it. The legal struggles against shanghaiing are also discussed, along with the crimps efforts to subvert legal infringements on their trade. Shanghaied In San Francisco is also a portrait of an era when San Francisco was a wide-open town, and when sailors were treated as third-class citizens. Anyone interested in maritime history, San Francisco history, or in just a good read, will benefit from this book."},{"Title":"Shanghaied in San Francisco (Maritime)","review":"Good information on a little-known issue in local history.

If you want to get healthy, read his books!"},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"It is so refreshing to read such an informative book that not only discusses diet solutions but encompasses all aspects of your well being. Thanks go to Jordan Rubin for sharing his inspiring story, and his roadmap to health based on the greatest book of all time."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"I was surprised at how readable this was. I anticipated a very dry presentation, but was pleasantly surprised. I was so surprised, in fact, that I read the whole book in less than 48 hours. I could not put this book down. (Keep in mind though that the last 1/3 of the book is filled with recipes and references, etc.)In spite of enjoying this book, I think that the section on functional fitness could be greatly improved upon. It's great for someone like my mother who does great if she can walk for 15 minutes at a time, but I think it is much too elementary for anyone who has even a remote resemblance of an exercise program already in use. Like I said, it would be great to start with but it doesn't tell you where to go from there.I also think that some of what he promotes is a little unjustified scientifically and I would like to see more backup before I would accept his ideas. For example; he recommends against eating pigs because of the dietary laws that God gave the Israelites and then proceeds to tell a story about a farmer that stacked 10 pigs in wire crates, only feeding the one on top and letting the ones below him eat the dung that dropped down. They all survived. That's all well and good, and while I wouldn't want to eat those particular pigs, pigs are not generally raised in situations even remotely like that. Pigs, when given the opportunity, are very picky about keeping their toileting area separate (on the opposite side of the pen in my experience) from their feeding area. Just because it is possible for pigs to survive in less than ideal situations doesn't make it favorable for them to do so, nor does it make them any less edible. To summarize, don't eat pigs because 1) God said so, 2) Something about toxicity (that again he didn't backup) and, 3) They can survive in crappy situations.Oh, and you're not supposed to eat rabbits either. This with no explanation except the ever present \\"because God said so.\\"While abiding by God's original dietary laws may very well be the optimal choice for health, I would personally like to see some other support of this plan besides the book of Leviticus.There are a couple other things that he brought up that I would beg for more evidence of than was presented, but that being said it was definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"I like this book a lot, I also bought the audio version to listen to it over and over to learn all the information provided on health.

I would recommend this to anybody who is sick and would like to get well in a natural way."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"Before I begin, let me just say that I have read several of Jordan Rubin's books, use a few of his products, and do agree with almost all of his ideas. That said, I think that anyone reading this book will quickly discover whether or not they really want to be well and what kind of attitude they have regarding the \\"work\\" it might take to discover health again. Whether or not this program is \\"the answer\\" people are looking for, it is filled with common sense practices and positive messages that can't help but improve one's life."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"I think this is a good book.

There is no safe temperature so as to ensure this parasite (among other parasites that the swine carry), will be killed.In the book of Exodus 23:19 in the bible (and In Jewish Law), meat and milk are never combined. Separate utensils are used for each, and a waiting period is observed between eating them. On page 314 of The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness, there is a recipe for \\"Steak Au Poivre\\" that calls for 2/3 cup of whipping cream, along with butter, for a sauce that is poured over the steak. This recipe outright breaks scripture principle (and Jewish Law), and wow, I was surprised to find it included in this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"Love the format and content of this book!

The ad claims the supplement cured him of Crohn's Disease. I almost hit the floor when I was channel surfing and saw his picture on the tube. I watched in astonishment as he claimed to be riddled with diseases that apparently went beyond his Garden of Life sell-out cure. Whatever he's claiming, it sounds fishy.

In addition, of great interest are the comprehensive sections on emotional health and finding purpose in life -- topics that were touched upon in his last book, but are fleshed out here for those who want to comprehend the holistic approach to health more fully.Lastly, Rubin makes a much stronger statement of faith in his new offering. We see more of who he really is and of the driving faith behind his work and vision."},{"Title":"The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness","review":"An excellent follow up. Despite what some readers say, I have tried his products before I read these books (by years), and they replaced 4 prescriptions I could not seem to get off (doctors said I never would). If I stop taking the products, I have found I must go back on the 4 prescriptions. Info I have found in this and The Maker's Diet have allowed me to eat FAR more foods than I could tolerate before. (I was forced for years to eat no meat, no dairy, and now I can CHOOSE what I eat.) My Mother and Sister, though having different health issues, have been equally helped and they were VERY skeptical (my father ran hospitals for a living, so we shared a traditional MD's view of the world). This system WORKS; I thought that Clenzology would be hooey anyway, but have found it indespensible. Each time I doubt him I have been proven wrong.

Reading his materials has also made me realize that my grandmother really did know the truth of food (We thought she was just too fanatical all these years....but I guess I should have listened more to the woman in my life who was healed from cancer through the application of eating healthy).

Most of it has to do with changing dietary and lifestyle habits.Every supplement I've ever seen makes similar claims to those made by Mr. Rubin's company. It's unfortunate that there seems to have been an issue making the right disclaimers to the claims in this case, but let's be honest - I think there are alot of companies that need to make adjustments to their advertising.

Either way, this book can be enjoyed for the major contribution it makes to the shadowy history of individual combat units (Marines in this case) in the &quot;stalemate&quot; Korean war of 1952-53. Ballenger thoroughly documents with gripping individual stories the often brutal fighting in mid-Korea between UN forces and the Chinese and North Korean armies. Historically accurate, Ballenger's book highlights &quot;unknown&quot; major skirmishes that more than once came down to desperate hand-to-hand combat over a few meters of rocky Korean hills. The author was there himself, and it shows. The 2-volume series produced by this neophyte author is worthy of considerable editorial and public attention.

Larger battles consisted of those for Carson, Vegas, and Reno, which were outposts named for Nevada cities, and also Ungok, Gray Rock and of course Boulder City. Boulder City, which is \\"a place unheard of by most Americans\\" ended up being the last engagement of U.S. Marines in Korea and also a major turning point in the War.

Perhaps that is so, but far from all the time: not now, not a hundred, or two hundred years ago. In mathematics, two romantic heros stand out, N. H. Abel, and Evariste Galois. Both lived at the start of the Nineteenth Century, and both died tragically, Galois in a duel.The author Infeld is a romantic, and great writer; and he happens to also be a scientist. In addition to this book, Leopold Infeld wrote other captivating books. He was one of the first scientists who sucessfully intertwined science with popular writing. Infeld himself escaped from the Jewish Ghetto in Cracow, Poland, at the time of WWI. As he matured, he lived as a refugee scientist and writer, and miraculously overcame an incredible web of adversities that were stacked up against him.Other books by Infeld include an autobiography, called &quot;Quest&quot;, and a popular science book, &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot;, co-authored with Albert Einstein. Both books were bestsellers when they first appeared. I stumbled over Infeld's Galois biography purely by accident: Started to read late in the evening, were immediately hooked, and I didn't put the book down until the end, at sunrise. In the book we read about the last night of Galois's short life, the night before his fatal duel the next morning (&quot;There is so little time&quot; he wrote!). The young Galois hurriedly scribbled his original and profound ideas of matheamtics, and he gained imortality through the power of his insight. The life of Evariste Galois is a truly captivating drama, and written by one of the great story tellers. I am convinced that Infeld's stories, and his books, are less well known than they deserve to be.Review by Palle Jorgensen, October 2003."},{"Title":"Whom the Gods Love: The Story of Evariste Gaolois (Classics in mathematics education ; v. 7)","review":"I loved the book - it was very absorbing and moving; I think it to be well written.This is a story of brilliance, strong passionate activism, love, and stupidity.From what I heard from a few math professors, this seems a faithful representation of Gaolois's life (nothing they read besides contradicts the book)."},{"Title":"Just Between Us Girls: Secrets About Men From The Mayflower Madam","review":"I was disappointed in the book from the perspective that while it was titalating to get the perspective of Sidney (mostly because of her racy past) I didn't learn anything. Not that I have that much experience but only that I would think most women know everything she imparted. There is no real know how or instructions on how to get things done but just some general verbage on what should be done. Not that it's bad but I think if you have had one or two relationships already then this book is not the one for you. There are several other books on becoming a good lover and partner that far outshine this one. I believe it sells because of the novelty associated with the author and if you like the little juicy tidbits she throws out here and there you will probably enjoy the book.

Most of her ideas are logical: Take care of yourself once you have a man - don't let yourself go. Understand that, as unfair as it may be, that men want you to look as good as when you met, even though he may have lost his hair and gained weight!These women are temporary fantasies. They don't complain about the kids, their jobs, the housework or anything else when these men show up. It's unfair, yes, but that is why the men are willing to pay to escape reality for a little while.

We were laughing out loud at the humor and descriptiveness in the book. The author is clever and quite funny. We were also amazed at the odd combination of high brow and low brow in her escort business.Since it is considered the oldest profession, there must be something compelling about it.

It was only 50 cents so I got it. Well, should you come across it you can safely skip it. Ms. Barrows pretty much uses this book as a platform to defend herself and explain why she turned to pimping. That's okay, but wasn't that the purpsoe of her first book? So after re-reading her story again in Between Us Girls you finally get the meat of the book and what do you get? Not much. Mostly, Barrows argues that in order to hold on to your man you have to act like a $500 a night call girl in the bedroom. You must be on guard, on your toes and ready to perform at a moments notice. To back this up she points out that some of her old clients actually left thier wives and families to marry her girls. I wonder how long those marriages lasted? Should you take Ms. Barrow's advice?

When I was starting out I had no idea. I needed to know basic stuff, like how do I get a barcode to put on my magazine's cover so it can be sold in retail outlets ... what kind of software do I need to buy so I can do the magazine's layout ... how do I get my magazine distributed in bookstores ... how do I find freelance writers ...

I think the few negative reviews are pretty unfair. I don't think this book was intended for people who have big budgets and venture capital - it was written for everybody else, people who dream of starting their own magazine but their budget consists of what they have in a savings account and their office consists of the desk in the corner of their dining room. The author's point is, you don't need to have a huge budget to be a success. If you do have a huge budget then great, this book is probably not for you. If you want to know how to do it on a shoestring that's what this book is for. Anyway the real value of the book is all of the practical information. If you don't know where to get a barcode or how to do layout for example, there aren't any other books out there that will help you with that.

A must read."},{"Title":"How Not to Start a Magazine","review":"I am in the process of starting a hopefully large scale publication, with magazine, calendar and special editions... the works. I bought this book because of all the high recommendations, but the reality is I tossed it within 5 minutes of buying it and flipping through.This author has almost no experience at magazine publishing or management. They are writing the dialogue almost off the cuff, from the top of their head with little or no research, citations, or factual information regarding the actual business of magazine publishing, or much less taking a magazine to market. There is little or no mention of the intricacies of test marketing and prototyping, budgeting, vendors and service providers, interviews or case histories with publishers, marketing, print methods, distribution and fulfillment, etc.They consistently use a derisive undertone in their text when referencing anyone who actually wants to use a budget to procure vendors, services, etc. and create a genuine, quality publication, one that will sell. It seems this author failed at attempting to start a newsletter or magazine that they wanted to produce and develop for free!The author practically calls an entrepreneur with more conventional needs for start-up capital and quality production services a \\"fat cat\\" because they have, or need, and want to spend cash to build a publication. They are writing from the perspective of someone who more or less arose one morning and decided to make something of a low-budget, low-circulation, low-quality newsletter and failed before even reaching the starting gates, gave up, and decided for some reason to write a business consulting manual or start-up guide instead. This flimsy tome will waste your time and money, I was so blown away they would publish such a simplistic account of the whole business that I tossed it in the bin.What's a shame is I'm sure there is a decent sized market of entrepreneurs, investors, students and professors, industry workforce and lay people, who want a well written and hands-on look at the entire process of magazine publishing, from start to finish. I havent found one yet, and most books that pop up on the Amazon search are cursory or just plain amatuerish. Better to find a solid textbook on modern publishing, and managing, marketing, budgeting and controlling the production from a university bookstore."},{"Title":"How Not to Start a Magazine","review":"Having started and built two successful magazines, I was horrified by this book.

On the one hand, the book succeeds in presenting a well-written and interestingly presented sequence of classic French or French style recipes. On the other, it fails in presenting its primary contention that it can simplify French cooking. As the author and his cowriters admit in more than one recipe, this is long with lots of ingredients, but you can do it if you just break it down into its (many) individual steps. All the author has succeeded in doing is to show that the complexity can be broken down into a lot of steps and that what may look simple to a talented professional chef who has been in the business for over thirty years, still looks daunting to the amateur. The observation by Daniel Boulud on the difference between amateurs and professionals still holds. Professionals simply see things differently by virtue of having done the same preparations thousands of times over.Since Delouvrier fails in making his primary contention, which can set his book apart from all the others, what is the value of the material otherwise? As always, it all depends on what you are looking for.The book is organized in almost exactly the same style as Daniel Boulud's \`Caf&eacute; Boulud Cookbook' with seven chapters of recipes instead of Boulud's four. The chapters are chronological, each dealing with a different stage in the author's career, beginning with his fairly straightforward versions of dishes from la cuisine Bourgeoise such as cassoulet and coq au vin through the author's interpretation of haute cuisine dishes at his very expensive Manhattan venues. The chapters are:Family Cooking, Boulogne-SurGesse, FranceHotel School and the Early Years, Toulouse, FranceCaf&eacute; de la Paix, Paris, FranceJournet Through Discovery (Montreal)Les Celebrites, New York CityLesPinasse and Four Stars, New York CityBasic Recipes (Pantry preparations)The book does have the author's reminiscences which are entertaining and have a strong family resemblence to memoirs written by several other French chefs.So the question remains, \`Why should I buy this book'.First, I think the recipes are very good, with the ones in the first four chapters being much more accessible to the amateur than the fifth and sixth recipe. The pantry recipes are interesting in that they show the chef is doing high end French technique. Stock recipes, with a few little twists, may have come right out of the Culinary Institute of America.Second, the recipes in the first two chapters include some regional specialities outside of Provence and Lyon. The recipes in the last three chapters do include some Oriental influences, but not much.Third, almost all the recipes are for entrees. Not too much space spent on desserts or salads. The mix of meat, fowl, fin, and shellfish is about right, with very few recipes for rabbit or other game style protein.Fourth, the headnotes offer interesting comments on the source and nature of the material and the preparation. Good, but not dramatically better than other books.If you already own a copy of Julia Child's \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and Jaques Pepin's books on technique, the basis for buying this book narrows down to getting the book to see this chef's take on things plus some recipes from Gascony.There are no wine pairings, which I don't miss. The photography is competant. There are no ingredient sources listed, but then, there are not a lot of rare ingredients. Just lots of them and some relatively expensive ingredients.If you want a book like this, I would recommend one first look at Boulud's book cited above. If you really like that kind of book and want more, then I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Mastering Simplicity: A Life in the Kitchen","review":"typical cookbook for cooks who have background in the field.

First off, I stumble over the spotlight review dated sometime in 2004 by a librarian who had never heard of the contributors! Excuse please, but what library hired this \\"librarian\\"? Never heard of Elaine Pagels, the foremost scholar on Gnostic studies? Never heard of Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy? Never heard of Karen King? People often scare me.In any case, this is in no way a copy-cat book. For one thing, it's not a second-rate thriller. And for another, it's not Brown's book that's important. It's what his book has done to the population at large. It's made them intensely curious about things that have waited a long time for such vital reactions. It's a honest effort to deal with the questions Dan Brown's novel has brought up, asking some of the best and wisest in their fields for comment. And such a varied bunch. From the gentle, careful, and yet oddly daring Pagels, to the somewhat suspect Michael Baigent (Holy Blood, Holy Grail, now suing Brown for some of the lolly he thinks rightly his: hope he loses), to the very scholarly and deadly serious Karen King, to the delicious Susan Haskins (whose book about Mary Magdalene is a \\"must read\\"), to Margaret Starbird (always sincere if not always focused, and I promised myself I would not question that last name)...heavens, what a bang, as they say, for your buck.Good stuff."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"This book is fine for those who want more background on The Da Vinci Code. It does its best to be evenhanded on controversial points and let the reader decide. It is dull in spots, but that's what you get when you present this type of material. It accomplishes its goal well. For that reason I give it 5 stars.Reading about the controversy over Mary Magdalene makes me wonder how anyone can possibly take Christianity seriously. We know so little, really, about who Jesus really was and what he said or did. Nothing was written by him personally. The reports we have came from decades after the fact, by which time pious legends by the dozen had gotten mixed in. If there is such doubt over Mary's role, how can anyone believe that the rest of what is reported about Jesus is really correct? The idea that Jesus' bloodline extends into the present strikes me as hogwash, but then so is the virgin birth and the Resurrection. In my opinion, the editors of our present Bible acted correctly in rejecting the Gospel of Mary and other early Christian texts as not likely to be either true or divinely inspired. Where they erred was in accepting Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and the other books of the Bible as much better. Throughout history political leaders have dreamed of using religion to unify society. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to find a fantasy compelling enough to prevent some people from taking up a slightly different fantasy. The result is a heresy problem which can never be solved. Christianity is hardly unique in this respect; Islam and every religion you can name have the same difficulty.For an even more logical perspective on these questions than Burstein's, I would suggest \\"Ghost In the Universe\\" by Edis."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Initially I read the \\"Passover Plot\\" then the \\"Gnostic Gospels\\" followed by \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\". I will admit that I was taken in by Holy Blood up until I got to the list of Grand Masters of the Priory. At that point I smelled a rat and then the conclusion that Plantard was the direct descendant of the Merovingian's and rightful King of France brought me to the realization that the entire thing was hoax or at least not believable. As soon as I started reading the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" I recognized it's roots in Holy Blood (a fiction) but enjoyed it for what it is - a fun read based on a few facts, some assumptions, and a lot of good storytelling. So after reading the DVC and listening to the furor that it generated, I purchased \\"Secrets of the Code\\".I thought this was a very good book because it offered some commentary and a wide variety of view points. Some of these view points came from scholars(e.g Elaine Pagels) but many were from interested parties who offered their own interpretations and insights. Some of these essays have been criticized because they did not come from legitimate scholars, but then legitimate scholars frequently have narrow views, hidden agendas, and offer their own interpretations of events with no more factual basis than the layman might have. Plus, this book was not offered as a scholarly refutation of the DVC but as a series of insights into various aspects and conclusions described in the novel and I think it does this quite well.Relative to this book I thought the first portion, which was devoted to the \\"Sacred Feminine\\" was tedious and over long. The point was made and then beaten into the ground. The segment devoted to the biographical sketch of Dan Brown was interesting but not overly relevant in my opinion. It sort of had the ring of intellectual snobbism but perhaps I was just overly sensitive to the typical East Coast snobbishness relative to \\"the right schools\\" and the \\"right parents\\". Nevertheless, it does give you some insight into Dan Brown and if nothing else should convince you that the DVC is a novel and that Dan Brown is no scholar - biblical or otherwise.Of all of the segments I was most interested in the Opus Dei essays. These are very divergent and the opinions expressed by the former members are quite opposite from what the current Opus Dei members say. The natural instinct is to dismiss the former members as being simply disgruntled members with an ax to grind, but then the current members acknowledge some things that left me wondering precisely where the truth is. For example in the DVC Dan Brown portrays Silas as a Monk who practices self-flagellation and uses the Celice for self-mortification to the point where he draws blood. Opus Dei points out that its members are not monks and that self-mortification is not demanded - but some members do practice it. The use of the Celice is encouraged but not required and certainly not to the point where it leaves wounds and scars. So was Dan Brown simply exaggerating? This point is left open.Perhaps the expectation of self-mortification is true and perhaps it isn't. Dan Brown portrays Opus Dei as a \\"secret\\" organization. Opus Dei maintains that they are not a secret organization and that they are open but when asked for their rules and regulations they produced them in Latin and not classical Latin but a church dialect making them difficult to impossible to understand or translate. No English version was available nor did it exist according to Opus Dei. This does not lead me to believe that they are not a secret organization or open to inspection by outsiders. This is simply an example of this section and it demonstrates Burstein's efforts to offer multiple views and to allow the reader to draw their own conclusion.The above comments on Opus Dei are an example of how the book addresses the important points raised in the DVC, from the Knights Templar to the Gnostics, to Christianity. Each section offers various interpretations and viewpoints without being judgmental or drawing any conclusions -- those are left to the reader.I liked this book and thought it gave some excellent insights into the DVC and most importantly it demonstrates that the novel is just that - a novel and a fictional one at that. A good book, a little slow at the start but worth the reading. I recommend it to anyone who would like to know more details regarding the many aspects of the Da Vinci Code."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"The Bible Thumpers are really disappointed Burstein's book of research is out, as they were hoping the interest in the alternate theology of the DaVinci Code would just go away, but here it has been on the best seller list for over a year now!! Burstein has done an admirable job of presenting the scholars with the research backing up the DaVinci Code. Burstein is a must-read if you want to know what the ruckus (a couple of books are out now \\"against\\" the DaVinci code info) is all about!! For older history, Kessinger Publishing has thousands of books available online backing up the subject and there are many large Masonic libraries around the world. Manley Hall has written a \\"bible\\" of these subjects, The Secret Teachings of All Ages; it's newest preface (2003 edition)backs Burstein up with much more than the inquisitors would like us to know. The new archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams,has written a book entitled Arius: Heresy and Tradition. Hooray that the Inquisitions are finally NOT prevailing in keeping people's minds in subservience to an old \\"cult\\" that prevailed thanks to Constantine's help and wiped out the others!! Do you know they drew and quartered Hypatia, a teacher at the library of Alexandria in Egypt?? Nice guys!!Burstein's material becomes all the more credible when one remembers that Giordano Bruno, after enthusiastically accepting Copernicus' theory that the sun is the center of the solar system, paid with his life for that \\"heresy\\" everyone knows now to be true. The destruction of the libraries like Alexandria was the reason scrolls like those found at Nag Hammadi and elsewhere were hidden, plunging our world into literal religious darkness. They shortly thereafter even started thinking the world was flat. How fundamentalists can keep parroting the church father's scriptures and \\"histories\\" without giving thanks now for Burstein's \\"revelations\\" is beyond me!! Thank heavens for Our Constitution penned by men(mostly Masonic) who were very aware of these \\"saviors\\" who had caused so much religious persecution. These sources of info will help you move beyond the worldly polarity of all this ruckus and see the universal truths that Jesus was trying to teach: The Kingdom of Heaven is Within, and Be in the World but not of it, etc."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Time is money. Money is everything. When a book about a hot book is rushed through the development process to hit the stores at the right time, slopiness prevails.I found the wealth of information balanced and interesting. But too many typos and even shredded, repeated lines do not lend credence to an overall book. Shabby editing and copyediting make one feel the research may be shabby too. That's why I've given it a \\"C\\" rating. It shot itself in the foot."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I was highly interested in Dan Burstein's expose of Brown's Da Vinci Code for the first half of the 626 page book but after that he wandered off into every other book or play with the same plot that is out there and goes into Brown's life and schooling etc. If you want a bio of Dan Brown, then the 2nd half is great but I found it rather boring and not telling anything about the controversial \\"secrets\\". That is done well enough in the first 200 pages --giving both pros and cons of the various themes brought on in Brown's book.One thing that irked me was how he continuously gives Brown so much credit for being the \\"first\\" to bring all the Mary Magdalene/Jesus/Templar hidden knowledge to light. This was not new territory to those who have been studying the underground, hidden religion for years. Another book, The Secret Order, which was every bit as informative and entertaining as Brown's book was published 2 months before and covered the same story and subject matter. If you want a very good enlightening and uplifting book then I suggest you read The Secret Order."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I loved a lot of things about this book. For instance, I really loved that the author took the time to both sides of the issues with compelling arguments from people in the know. It was fantastic to learn things about Mary Magdalene - especially that she really most likely wasn't the prostitute the Vatican wanted us to believe for so long.I gave it four stars because of my one complaint: Burstein spent a lot of time and energy on Mary Magdalene and the sacred feminine but not enough, in my opinion, on the Gnostic Gospels. I would have like more information about that.But it is still worth buying and reading. THere is a lot of great information supporting and otherwise on these controversial topics."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I have not read the book as yet; however, what I have seen in the chapters Contents is, thus far, exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I purchased this book a while ago and read it, then watched the thing on TV about it. Watching that confirmed my initial thoughts that Dan Burnstein was more about trashing Dan Brown then looking at a great fictional story and following that up with a book that could have been a great thriller but instead what I found was a book that treated Dan Brown's book as factual in every respect and then trashed it and Dan Brown with that line of thought.Dan brown is absolutely the best in providing us with stories that make us think and because of that Dan Burnstein provides us with books that make us wish he would gain an understanding of story telling. I hope he never goes over to Marrakesh, Morocco where the story tellers have passed their stories down for generations. If he does my guess is he will create some book called \\"the nonsense of storytelling\\".If you or your religious beliefs feel threatened by anything that Dan Brown writes then this book will do a great deal to help you regain you that thought process, otherwise it's pretty useless."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Much of what I wanted to say has been covered by a couple of detailed reviews prior to mine. In fact, I must say that I liked this book more than theThe Da Vinci Codebecause I didn't have to deal with the fictional plot at all. I am happy to see that a previous reviewer has provided a \\"recommended reading list\\" on Gnosticism. Besides all the other books on Gnosticism, I would strongly suggest readingThe Rozabal Line. Even though this is more like reading a Da Vinci novel, the fiction is layered with historical and religious material that sheds a great deal of light on the early influences on the Gnostics. While Secrets of the Code will help you understand the types of Gnostic material that is out there, Rozabal gets to the heart of the Eastern traditions and spirituality that possibly influenced much of these Gnostic traditions."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I received this book from Bzz Agent, a social marketing group, with quite a bit of suspicion. Would this be just another one of those books written by a literal Catholic Theologian to completely dismiss even the more fact based aspects of the original book? Would this be by some crazed conspiracy theorist trying to point out that fiction was indeed fact?From what I read, neither of these are true. If you look at the varied list of authors you will find a few with an obvious liberal or conservative, religious or non-religious bias, but the majority are just intellectuals explain what is fact and what is fiction from their point of view on the book based on their considerable knowledge of the subject. The section on Mary Magdalene is written by one of the most knowledgeable scholars in the field (actually a Lutheran) and the Da Vinci chapter is written by an art historian specializing in Da Vinci, his life and his work.I felt like the editor's intent was truly to educate the reader about questions that were probably brought up while they were reading the original work of fiction. I myself had a lot of questions about what was based on fact, what was based on new theories and what was completely the imagination on Dan Brown. I was curious to know more about the theories on Mary and secret sects, and this book answers most of those questions.The writing varies from author to author (and some of the subject matter was a little dry for me), but all in all I thought this book was a good read and made me feel a lot more informed on the subject."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"of all the books written around the novel this is the moist serious and better researched. it is not a matter of what your opinion is about. burnstein took the time to look into each of the issues and find the people that have written serious books about them. it is not about \\"debunking\\" it is about opening your mind to possibilities and questions. the da vinci code is a novel and people tend to forget that. but with all the contorversial ideas it brings about and all the debate it has rised; it is definitely great to summarize in one book the different theories about it. not everyone is up to read all the books, on all the themes. i've been reading about this theories for years and this is one of the greatest works, even for people new to the subject."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"If you are looking for a book that says &quot;Nothing to see here, Da Vinci Code is all lies, nothing to see here! Go to Church, don't think, just accept!&quot;, as several reviewers seem to want, this book is not it. This is an exploration of issues brought up in &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;, not an apologeticists refutation.While the book can get quite dry at times, it is a good overview of the issues and questions brought up by the &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;. No, DVC is not historical, it has flaws and errors, but it also challenges you to think about things that you have simply assumed were true, and that is always good. This book will continue that exploration.

If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; then \`Secrets of the Code' is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your reference collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right?As a voracious reader, I have read the best. Both \`The Da Vinci Code,' and \`Angels and Demons' which were both heart-stopping thrillers that keep you turning pages until you arrive exhausted at the end. You're truly &quot;in on the chase.&quot; Improbable as it seems, Dan Brown has opened the doors of our curiousity which makes one almost compelled to examine the \`evidence' further. \`Secrets of the Code' is a book that teaches, makes you think, and entertains, all at the same time. Few authors can accomplish that. In this case many educated experts on the subject matter.For those who say this book and Brown's books go against their beliefs and their dogma, consider this: The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research!If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. Read \`Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' and ANYTHING by Ken Follett! I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban. Buy this book, you will love it."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Literary ArmageddonIf you loved DaVinci Code or if you hated it, you must admit it did get a reaction from you....which in itself is one definition of a successful novel. Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testatment Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism.Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times.The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest. At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene.This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts. He said:\\"Now I know why. The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was \`the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says, \`When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.' No wonder they suppressed this stuff! The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff. Real \`Us' versus \`them' stuff, the polar opposite from \`God is within You.' \`My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination. But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity \`within you and without you.'\\"Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general:The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament.Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 ) is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John.James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition. It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502.The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079) by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates. His commentary generates strong reactions.Elaine Pagels has 2 books (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately. For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation. She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking. While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim. As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present. Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time.If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume New Testament Apocrypha.Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"First of all, like Mr. Brown's now world famous current novel, this is simply a great read! And that is my main criterion for any book! Just about everything in DA VINCE CODE is critiqued and analysed, from a photo of the book's inferences about some of the &quot;clues&quot; in the LAST SUPPER, with markings included, to real trivia like how near the Men's Room in the Louvre is to the road outside, and is the castle in Paris real.Or was the Agnus Dei headquarers in NYC given a high rating by Architectural Digest (etc.etc.) Sure, there are some holes in the book (DVC), which after all is a fictional novel, somewhat like an Umberto Ecco novel, but a much better and breezier read, and vastly superior narrative! Even while picking apart many trivialities, many of the commentators in SECRETS OF THE CODE note that many of the main premises have a lot of historical basis, such as that the books of the Bible were hand picked at the Niceon meeting (around 310 AD), and others tossed in the garbage (later discovered 1700-plus years in the Egyptian desert as the Gnosnic Books).The great thing about a book like MR. Brown's is it makes people think, something that has not been encouraged all the time by many organizations, not exempting religions.

This book &quot;Secrets to the Code, etc.&quot; is fun reading and you realize that alot of critical study has gone into compiling the evidence that leaves you wanting to ask more questions.

This book has a smattering of every topic readers might be curious about. Interviews with ELain Pagels whose scholarship I don't hightly value is in the book. So are some things I find boring. But the editor has even included a lenghty excerpt from the notirously un-scholarly &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;.

People often scare me.In any case, this is in no way a copy-cat book. For one thing, it's not a second-rate thriller. And for another, it's not Brown's book that's important. It's what his book has done to the population at large. It's made them intensely curious about things that have waited a long time for such vital reactions. It's a honest effort to deal with the questions Dan Brown's novel has brought up, asking some of the best and wisest in their fields for comment. And such a varied bunch. From the gentle, careful, and yet oddly daring Pagels, to the somewhat suspect Michael Baigent (Holy Blood, Holy Grail, now suing Brown for some of the lolly he thinks rightly his: hope he loses), to the very scholarly and deadly serious Karen King, to the delicious Susan Haskins (whose book about Mary Magdalene is a \\"must read\\"), to Margaret Starbird (always sincere if not always focused, and I promised myself I would not question that last name)...heavens, what a bang, as they say, for your buck.Good stuff."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"The Davinci Code is Fiction so anyone who thought it needed \\"deciphering\\" is very gullible.

The arguments in the book cover a wide range of opinion on any given topic and do not always agree with each other. Indeed, this is the strength of the book.

These books, based on the canonical Gospels and Hebrew prophecies, are in no way an attack on Christianity, but rather an attempt to restore its original message in its full integrity. Discussion of the New Testament gematria in the appendices of &quot;The Goddess in the Gospels&quot; is particularly relevant to the identity of Mary Magdalne as the archetypal &quot;Bride&quot;--ignored by the &quot;debunkers&quot; of the &quot;Code&quot; and also in &quot;Secrets of the Code.&quot;"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"More informative than the Da Vinci Code itself.

If you are looking for a mix of pro da Vinci code and anti da Vinci code people have to say, a sort of balanced presentation and response, you will not find it here. Only after I spent my money did I think to google the various contributors. Some are legitamate scholars. Elaine Pagels for example is a true scholar of gnosticism. (Some of her assumptions about gnosticism can be questioned for example how can a derivative work by gnostics written 500 years after the New Testament was written be a better source of Christian history. The standard approach is to put more weight on earlier documents than later - but I digress)The same could be said for mathmaticians, and some of the others, but they all are somewhat out of the left field.

However, rather than point to a long list of books, many of which I have read, Burstein's book also focuses on passages of those books that are relevant to the script of Brown's book.Most amazingly Brown's book did not include as much as it could have. Although he may have relied on some sources more than others, it becomes apparent on reading Burstein's book that Brown (and Burstein) faced an almost overwhelming amount of material.Burstein has excerpted relevant passages from many works, interviewed a notable list of authors including Dan Brown, and included material from articles about Brown's book or some aspect of the book found in various respected publications. Probably one of the most interesting sections includes reflections, comments and articles by individuals who currently belong or have belonged to Opus Dei. Theologians, art historians, and at least one \\"symbologist\\" have been included in the list of folks to comment on varous topics in the book.In one section, the journalist David Shugarts responds to questions he has previously researched concerning the technical aspects of the plot. He reports on \\"geographical positioning systems (GPS), maps, automobiles, logistics, aircraft, weapons and computer search engines, and other technological plot elements. According to Shugarts, Mr. Brown got many thing right and several things wrong.I liked this book very much because I found it informative without being judgmental, and sections of it are as interesting as the original Brown book. Although the various contributors have their own often opposing points of view which they often express, Mr. Burstein, as nearly as I can tell, has no position one way or another, and thus acts as a reasonable mediator."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I suspect that it was inevitable that with the success of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code it was only a matter of time before the copy-cats began showing up. Secrets of the Code by Dan Burstein isn't exactly like a copy-cat, but it does bang on the points made by Brown. In fact, this is really the fourth book dealing with some aspect of Grail mythology.....Burstein has pulled together contributors from a wide range of disciplines....archaeology, art history, religion, philosopy among others. While I don't recognize the contibutors, we are led to believe that they represent of leaders in their respective fields.If you've been captivated by Browns book, then Secrets of the Code is a must read for you. A quick look around book stores or public libraries will reveal a wide range of other books on the general topics of Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail, and Templar mythology....but honestly, Secrets of the Code is among the best.Dan Browns Da Vinci Code is probably one of the most controversial books to appear since I've been dealing with the reading public as a librarian. Secrets of the Code, if read and heeded, will give you the facts you need to debate Browns book intelligently.Get the book....read it."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Out of all of the books out there that attempt to explore the ideas from The Da Vinci Code, this one is by far the best jumping off point.Many of the books out there are written very one-sided, either trying to discredit all of Dan Brown's work or taking it to the extreme. This book takes the ideas one at a time and presents many different opinions on them -- conservative, extreme, and opinions in between.The author is basically a person who didn't know much about this stuff prior to reading The Da Vinci Code. Like many of us, he wanted to learn more. He went out, researched all the material he could get his hands on, and presents all the ideas he found here.He doesn't take the arguments, and try to draw conclusions and tell you what happened. He just says here is what different people think and why. It's up to you, the reader, to form your own opinion from all of the different arguments out there.It is a great way to begin your search for more information. It presents many different viewpoints, using excerpts from books, magazines, websites, and interviews.The sources of all the arguments are clearly identified, so you know just where to go to explore certain ideas further.This is the ultimate starting point to finding your own answers."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I am very impressed with how thorough and intelligent this book is. After reading a couple of other books claiming to answer the questions asked in Dan Brown's book (Hanegraaff and Maier's \\"DVC: Fact or Fiction?\\" and Lunn's \\"DVC Decoded\\") I was hungry for a book that didn't just blindly believe conspiracies or biblical word. Burstein has collected a full range of essays that cover all sides of this argument. I feel like I have learned a lot about the early Christian church, Gnosticism, the Templars, and the controversy behind the Priory of Sion. And I feel prepared for many \\"water cooler discussions\\" when the upcoming movie is released."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"As others have said, this book is not for anyone encumbered with religious blinkers. Neither will it answer the big question of exactly how much of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is truth and how much is fiction - though you will be able to classify quite a lot of it.What it will do is clarify what is known, what is speculative and what is unknown. And it will give you a head start into a lot of history which is fascinating and was never taught in any religious classes I attended. Had it been, I would likely have been and remained a lot more interested.So if you know it all and just want your knowledge confirmed, avoid this book. It will just upset you and maybe even confuse you with doubt.But if you want to hear informed and sometimes conflicting views and arguments and learn a lot of most interesting facts about the foundations of western culture and thought, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Dan Burstein is a business executive pushing venture capital. Yet, he confesses that he found Dan Brown' The Da Vinci Code entrancing and unforgettable as a novel. He says it is because it is a novel of ideas. Thus, he set out to explore those ideas to see what, if anything, was behind Dan Brown's book.A personal aside, whenever I read a book and the author gets something that I know wrong that should be obvious, I wonder about other stuff in the book where I don't know anything. In Brown's case, it was his geography of Paris on page 15. Having read &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; recently, I was familiar with the argument he was making, but still, I was skeptical.Burstein has assembled experts and sources for Brown's book and put them into a readable form. In some cases, he selects excerpts from other books. In other cases, Burstein interviews authors and experts. Some of them support Brown's argument and others don't. Even Opus Dei is given a section. My favorite section was a review of the facts and mistakes in Brown's book by David Shugarts. In some cases, Shugarts finds evidence to support Brown. Some interesting facts include that the publisher has set up phony websites, such as the one for the Swiss bank in the book. The bank does not exist, but it has a website on the Internet.There is also a glossary of characters and words mentioned by Brown with an explanation. In all, Burstein has put together an excellent collection of readings for anyone interested in The Da Vinci code."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"There are 75+ short articles, interviews and excerpts in this book all related to key topics in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" such as Mary Magdalene, the sacred feminine, the Gnostic texts, early Christianity, secret societies, Leonardo Da Vinci, codes and symbols. It's a lot of ground to cover: Burstein has done a superb job in finding selections to do that (all in under 400 pages).The quality of the contributors is very high, including gifted speculators such as the writers of \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", top New Testament scholars such as Deidre Good and Elaine Pagels, and even Dan Brown himself (from an interview).This is decidedly not a refutation of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" but some negative views of that book are included. Although the overall tone seems liberal, this doesn't appear to be a pro-Brown book either. After reading it, it left me with as many questions as when I started, although often different ones. It also left me with a list of books to go look for those answers in, books I feel I can trust after reading the corresponding excerpt here.For me, the most impressive selections were from the New Testament scholars Elaine Pagels and Deidre Good. I was impressed that, despite all their knowledge, they both are very open and acknowledge uncertainties. Whoever Mary Magdalene may have been, and whatever role women may have played in the early Church, it is wonderful that women today like Pagels and Good are making major contributions to our religious understanding. Mary Magdalene would not have been surprised."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I have read several books now about The Da Vinci Code, and this one was one of the best. It is unique because Dan Burstein is not an author presenting his own research and biases, but an editor who has compiled a variety of scholars to present their own research (and to an extent, their own biases) concerning the many questions raised by Dan Brown's novel. As in life, we are left to decide the answers for ourselves. Those who are firm in their beliefs may not enjoy all the passages, but, if you are of an open mind, the journey is worth taking."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I'm enjoying this book a lot. I wouldn't say I was interested in the concepts in The DaVinci Code until I read it. Once I read it I became interested in the facts behind Dan Browns fiction.Previously I read a couple of books that positioned themselves very much against Dan Browns interpretations of history and while the viewpoints were interesting, I felt they were a bit combative.Enter \\"Secrets of the Code\\" by Dan Burstein. This book really digs in depth on many of the mysteries in the DaVinci Code. Most importantly it presents well balanced discussion from both sides. It doesn't sway one way or the other and just provides information from experts on the topics being discussed and how those concepts relate to the DaVinci Code and history in general.If you are going to read a book before the movie, make it this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I had read the Da Vinci Code one year ago. While I was intrigued by the information presented in the book, I didn't know where I can read up/confirm those insights made in the Da Vinci Code. Then I found this book. This book offers the background information I needed to understand the Da Vinci Code better. It covers lots of ground, include those books Dan Brown researched for his book. It contains interviews/literature presented by authorities on the subject as well as unorthodox interpretations/history of the evolution of Christianity. Overall, very interesting to read. I would have given it a 5 star if it had a summary paragraph for each chapter (for example, the Mary Magadelen chapter is at times hard to follow with the opposing view points presented back to back without transitions in between)."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Because when you turn to page 130 you will find the biblical scholar Bart Ehrman providing ten reasons why \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is conspiratorial, supersititious nonsense. For a start, first century Judaism did allow precedents for celibacy, so there was no reason why Jesus had to be married. The Nag Hammadi material does not emphasize Jesus' humanity. Often it does the opposite. By the time of the Council of Nicea, a large majority of Christians believed in Jesus' divinity. There is no evidence that Mary Magdalene came from the House of Benjamin, or that she was pregnant. And my favorite, the Dead Sea Scrolls are, contra Dan Brown, entirely Jewish and have nothing directly to do with Christianity at all.This book is a collection of articles and interviews which look at the questions and mysteries the book raises. If you have little patience with Dan Brown's pseudo-historical tripe and are worried that other people might believe its preposterous fairy tales, there is much in this book that will satisfy you. There are a whole host of plot holes in the book. For a start the hero Robert Langdon points out an anagram in Latin that only works in English. Elsewhere a character reads an English Bible in a French church, while an anagram is made of \\"Mona Lisa\\" unaware that Da Vinci did not use or originiate the title of his most famous painting. For some odd reason Brown says the Council of Nicea was four centuries after Jesus' death when clearly it was less than three. Alexander Pope did not preside over Isaac Newton's funeral, though he did write an epitaph several years afterwards. There is also an article on the Plantard affair. Plantard claimed to have documents that linked Jesus, the Merovingian dynasty, the Knights Templar, the Masons, the Holy Grail and the Priory of Sion, which has supposedly been led by Da Vinci, Newton, Victor Hugo, Debussy and Plantard himself. From his documents came forth \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,\\" and 20 years later \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" But as it turns out, Plantard had a history of financially dubious transactions and links to right-wing anti-semetic groups. There is no reason to believe the documents are anything other than forgeries.Unfortunatley, the book is not a detailed refutation of Brown and there is a \\"balance\\" between serious scholarship and irresponsible credulous journalism. So on the one hand we get excerpts from a couple of books by Elaine Pagels, interviews with James A. Robinson, and excerpts from selected Gnostic gospels. We also have an interesting interview from a scholar who points out that Pope Gregory's conflation of Mary Magdalene with several women of loose virtue was an accident, not a misogynist conspiracy. We also have a debate between Kenneth Woodward and Karen King. Woodward argues that it is not clear that the letters to Timothy and the Gospel of Mary were written at roughly the same time. It is possible that Mary was written several decades afterwards. King, rather disappointingly does not respond to this point.But you also have to look at an excerpt from \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,\\" as well as some other pseudo-historical excerpts about the Templars and Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife. Passages quoted by Timothy Freke show the flaws of this sort of scholarship. Freke describes Philo as a Gnostic (he was not). He refers to the \\"Jewish God Jehovah,\\" when \\"Jehovah\\" is actually an attempt to prounce \\"YHWH\\" with the vowels of \\"Adonai\\" and \\"Elohim.\\" He says the Gospels refer to Mary Magdalene as the \\"prostitute lover\\" of Jesus when in fact the Gospels do not describe her as either. Freke argues that Jesus never actually existed, a view not supported by any serious scholar, and decisively refuted in the first volume of John Meier's \\"A Marginal Jew.\\" We get both sides of the debate over \\"The Last Supper,\\" and not surprisingly Brown does not come out looking well. (If the person commonly believed to be John is actually a woman, than where is John? And which apostle doesn't show up at all? And couldn't any feminine qualities in John refer to his youth [he was by tradition the youngest of the disciples] and to Da Vinci's own homosexuality?)People may think it is useful to compare both sides in a debate about history. But it is one thing to compare articles on the French Revolution. It is another to include serious scholarship and gratuitous nonsense and pretend to be neutral between them. Would we respect a book that included serious scholarship on the Holocaust with the ravings of apologists and neo-Nazis who pretend to deny it? Obviously the theories of \\"the Da Vinci Code\\" are not that malevolent, but they are not more intelligent. Still, though Burnstein loses points for cowardice, there is a certain pedagogic value in this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I consider myself a non-religous person but after I read the Da VinCi Code I just couldn't stop looking up everything to do with religion, this book was amazing and I recommend everyone read this book. I am only 15 years old and totally understood this book so it is was a pretty eaasy read I thought."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Burstein's book starts out in good faith-- to point out what parts of the Da Vinci Code are factual and to further explain them. However, it is soon realized that the book could be abridged to approximately ten pages without any loss of thought whatsoever. The first section is Mary Magdalene. Twenty pages later the section is still continuing, which may not be so bad if the issue was that comprehensive, however, Burnstein's source material is totally uninteresting and so repetitive and reiterated that it dulls the topic instead of making it interesting.Burnstein uses little if no source material from Christian or Catholic apologetics (there is a little box on one page that actual does name Christian defenses but it does not even explain the view points). All of the writers are radical liberals and the &quot;conservatives&quot; he names are more like center leaning liberals. Obviously Christian and/or Catholic apologetics should be consulted for a book explaining attacks on their nature. Other reviews mention that this book represents a wide range of views--but it doesn't.Burnstein's book makes the assumption that the reader has below average intelligence. In one section there is a question and answer to events in the Da Vinci Code. One question : Does the ODAN (an Opus Dei &quot;watch group&quot;) exist? First of all, the website URL is mentioned in the Da Vinci Code--any half wit would be able to type it into the internet.An author who writes about future economics and who describes himself as an amateur in the genre that this book is written should NOT write a book about the Da Vinci Code."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"The code broken? Hardly. But a readable guide to what some might find troubling or intriguing in Brown's novel. It is especially suited to thiose who found the novel too short.While this book is an interesting follow up to the Da Vinci Code, neither it nor Dan Brown's novel suggest Brown's fiction merits the title of an \\"alternative theology.\\" THAT is wishful thinking, and nothing more."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"I find this book too long and for anyone interested in the sujects, it is no more than a rehash. Maybe if you have never heard of Da Vinci or Mary Magdalene this book might be of interest."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Dan Burstein is a money-maker, period. Thus, it is very easy to understand his jumping on the bandwagon to take advantage of the interest in various theories postulated in The Da Vinci Code. Most of the interviews with various experts in the field and excerpts from their works were extremely interesting, although Burstein's attempt to give a voice to people not interested in the debunking of the sham of Christianity was tedious. The fact that he included and gave equal veracity to his son's (very boring) high school essay is evidence of the intellectual stature of Dan Burstein. While I can appreciate the interest of most of the articles and interviews he collected, I cannot give any credence to Dan Burstein, who believes himself capable of coming to scholarly conclusions about the mysteries behind The Da Vinci Code. His statements on recent television programs show that he is trying to take advantage of the sensationalism, while at the same time pacifying people on both sides of the question. Obviously, offending either side would make it more difficult to do what he is really about, making money. Dan Burstein should leave patristics to the authorities on patristics. As a self-described authority on \\"the mysteries behind The Da Vinci Code,\\" he comes across as ludicrous. Save your money for the books by the real scholars."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"Talk about hitching a ride on someone else's success! Burstein writes an interesting companion to &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;, but seems to forget one thing: IT IS A NOVEL - FICTION. This fasination with the genre is silly, really! It is not meant to be anything but escapism reading. This isn't the only book, article, etc. that are trying to cash in on Dan Brown's success, but come on people, you're taking all this way, way. way too seriously. Writers of fiction almost always take literary license, and looking for loopholes, errors and historical mistakes takes any entertainment value away from it. This book is almost as long as the novel - now seriously..... I'm glad I didn't buy this book (A friend at a bookstore let me borrow it for the weekend), and I'm sorry to say that after fifty pages I skimmed mercilessly, but was amused occasionally, and thankfully Burstein has a knack for making boring nonesense readable if not of any real value - besides his, and his publisher's profits that is.............."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Davinci Code","review":"The Da Vinci Code is a NOVEL, a work of FICTION!

If you don;t like it, don't read it! The Da Vinci Code was entertaining. I loved it but I didn't recheck all my personal beliefs after reading it! This is a bit like the Blair Witch Project.

Not to mention rounding up every fruitcake he could find to write reviews on a work of fiction, things that don't exist, and other people places and things that provide absolutely no credible proof as to whatever it is they are saying. Combine this with his cheap shot at President Bush, which is also unproven, and you have another work of fiction writing about fiction.I'm surprised Burstein didn't gather together all his liberal and leftist whackos to write a review on Little Red Riding Hood.Burstein would have been a lot better off reading some of the other books on DVC before indulging in this escapade. Of course, that would not have been timely enough to cash in on the craze, would it?Most of the historical incidents Dan Brown talks about are myths or gross exaggerations based on incidents of much less historicity than he &quot;explains&quot;.Only radical feminists would overlook the fact that the Bible and Christian teachings are full of heroic stories of women, and that Jesus may really be the first &quot;feminist.&quot;Only an uneduated fool would believe the Catholic church murdered millions of women. I'm sorry, but you folks who bought that lie shouldn't have slept through history classes. Time to get out the history books and brush up a little on reality. Then, after you do a little homework, read some of the other books on DVC that clearly point out the errors in DVC. After you do that, check around a little. There are some people in some religions that also believe Jesus and Mary might possibly have been married. But I doubt any of them believe they started a new blood line of royalty.Oh, yeah, and who cares what Leonardo portrayed in his art? Since when was he an authority on the life of Christ. He hated the church, which should tell you a little bit about his lifestyle.Now, get on with the search for better books on DVC. You might be surprised, and really learn something.
