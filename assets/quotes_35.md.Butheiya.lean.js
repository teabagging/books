After THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, a down-and-out story of a hapless writer addicted to personal ads, it's the best book I read so far this year. BEAUTY QUEEN is about a girl named Sam who's having trouble with money, her mother, and her mother's abusive boyfriend. She decides to move out into her own apartment. Since money is hard to come by when all she's doing is working at a fast food place, she decides to become an exotic dancer. Sam later on gets addicted to heroin. And slips into the hash reality of drugs. A superb book and a must read! I couldn't stop caring about what happened. Like all great books it's a little disturbing and not something I'm bound to forget soon! Try this book!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I am a HS reading/English Teacher. Some my students in my reading LAB have never read an indepentdent reading book. This book will keep (mostly girls) interested and they will finish the book. I do however recommend that it be given out indiscriminately, due to the subject matter. It is good for more mature students."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book is very scary in ways you don't really see until the end. It's strange how people are truly like the one's in Beauty Queen. This book deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I was pulled in by this book the minute I opened it and read the first diary entry.You get to know Sam so well, and you begin to understand how she feels and understand how she justifies what she does.I would recommend this story to any teenage girl, not only because of the moral behind the story, but because it is just such a great book."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"When I first picked book up, I was drawn to the cover, And as I read the back,I knew it was of as going to be one of those books that you don't want to put down.The diary style entry really kept my attention throughout the of course of the book.Sam, the main character in the book is an aspiring actress and ends up working at The Web, a local topless bar, Making $600 to $700 each night, When her magic fuji becomes a regular habit,She has no problems paying for it.All in all this book was very imformative and exciting.. with a surprize lurking around every corner..I was very impressed."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book features the diary of Sam, a young woman looking for an acting job. She starts a cleaning bussiness. the woman's whoose house their cleaning is a stripper, she tells them they can make a lot of money, so she does it. Along the way, she meets good and bad people. Some change her life forever. This book is so good I read it in one night!! READ IT!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Wow, i read this book within 6 hours (same day). This book caught my interest within the first sentence. Many teens can relate to this 19 year old who dreams of being a famous actress but gets sucked into a world of topless dancing, heroine, and a false sense of love. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone that wants to take a look into this girl's dangerous habit."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"NOTHING in this slim book rings true. The main character is like something from Melrose Place. She is supposed to be 19 years old, but writes/talks like a 12 year old Valley Girl. Very silly and a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"It was a great book, and I really got into it. I finished it the same day I borrowed it from the library and that's odd because I don't like reading. The book is honest, it's not about some beautiful girl with a perfect life, the story really opens your eyes and you become fond of Sam (main charactar). It's written in diary form and if you're not a fan of that writing, you WILL be surprised, Linda Glovach is a great author. Read it."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"It's given me another perspective on drugs and how you live for the next fix. I've never read anything more dramatic and sad like this.I gave it four stars because I wanted to know more about Blaine Johnson. It seemed to me that he was more than a corrupt cop and a sweet man. I felt that there was more about him than that. But otherwise I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book is one of the best books I've read in a while. It's one of those books that once you start reading you absolutely can't stop. I fell asleep reading this book many times because I alwasy wanted to know what was going to happen next because it always had you one the edge. I would recommend this book to anyone thatwas willing to read about a girl names Samantha who comes from a bad home life and tries to find a job to express herself and make her feel good about herself at the same time. Her and her friend go to find a job at a topless bar to make some fast easy cash and they wind up getting the jobs because they are both very pretty girls and Sam gets the job as a dancer and her friend takes a job as a bartender. When it's Sam's first night on the job she doesn't feel too god about herself but one of her co-workers shot her up with some heroin and it made her felt like she always wanted to feel, good about herself. So she of course got very hooked on it and meets many guys that become very good friends but one she feels like she falls in love with him and she thinks he feels the same way about her. So they see each other for a while and well you'll figure out the rest when you read the book because it would be a waste to pass this book up. Please don't read the other reviews where they scored this book really low because in my opinion I think anyone would like it."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"The book was very good and interesting. But at the end of the book it was very sad and I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"i really enjoyed reading this book. sum parts where a little scary to me because sometimes. but overall it was was really good. one of those books u can't wait to see wat happens next or even fears wat happens next."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"omg! my name is samantha (like the character in the book) and my best friend's name is Nicole...(like the best friend in the book.) anyway, i think that if Samantha had a lot more people who DIDN'T do drug around her maybe things would of been different. i kinda feel sorry for her because no one really loved her the way she wanted to be loved."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Written as a young girl's diary, the book immediately immerses you as Samantha's best friend, the one she will tell everything to. I found myself liking Sam right away, I imaged her as having an innocence, or gullibility to her that was sweet but not annoying; and right away we see that her feelings run deep beneath the surface of her pretty face.Sam starts her diary immediately following her break up with her boyfriend, who she cared deeply for and who abruptly informed her that he was seeing a woman 15 years his senior. He broke her heart, and so at her psychiatrist's suggestion, she begins to write down her feelings for us. In light of being her only confidant, right away we discover that her mother is a well-off alcoholic, a former model falling into her decline, with a handsome boyfriend who would like nothing more than to get to know Sam a little better while her mother is passed out. Right away we glimpse Kevin Reed's intentions as Sam returns home to find him in her bedroom watching porn flicks and asking her to join him.Sam knows she needs a change in her life, but her low self esteem tells her she is not smart enough for college, that no one could possibly love her, and that she will never be able to even take acting classes to become the actress she dreams of being. She and her best friend Nicole do find a nice place and move in, taking Sam's diabetic cat with her. Then Sam decides to take a job in a topless club, leaving behind her low paying fast food job. She is very nervous at first, and a fellow dancer turns her onto the \\"relaxing\\" effects of heroin, telling her that her modesty and uneasiness will dissolve, making the job more tolerable. Which it does.And so begins Sam's decline. Still heart-broken over her ex-boyfriend, she meets a man named Angelo who has ties to the mafia but treats her with respect and affection. She also meets Blaine, a handsome and reckless cop who frequents the strip club. I found these two relationships of particular interest in reading Ms. Glovach's story, because Sam is at heart an innocent girl, she readily trusts the cop and not the mafia thug; and the good/bad roles here are reversed, only magnifying Sam's naivet&eacute; when judging character. Her desire to be loved is heart wrenching, and manifests in all the love that she pours out to others who become close to her. In the case of her ailing cat, the love is justified. But in the case of Blaine, this love is used against her in a thoughtless and heartless manner by a man who is seeking only his own gratification for his own sick uses.Finding a release from her pain, boredom, dejection, and feelings of inadequacy with the heroin, her usage increases at an alarming rate while we listen in helpless silence to her denial of addiction. Eventually, she is unable to even finish a diary entry without shooting up, and yet still she offhandedly dismisses her habit as recreation rather than real addiction.This sad tale of a beautiful girl becomes all the more depressing when you realize that it has truly poured from the heart of Anygirl in Anywhere. Our daughters, our sisters, our nieces, our friends; they all manifest feelings of inadequacy somewhere in their life, and this story could be theirs. On a quick note, the author, Linda Glovach, tells of purchasing and using heroin in order to \\"get the feel of the book\\", and found herself addicted and almost dead in a hospital. Her amazingly articulate vocalization of her experience should be noted. Of her own experience with heroin addiction, she said, \\"In truth, you make a deal with the Devil. He takes away your pain, but he owns you. You live for the next fix.\\"Poetic and real. Don't be fooled into believing that this is a book only for teens, do yourself a favor, especially if you have a daughter, and pick this up. It's a quick, poignant, unforgettable read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"A review by AllisonThis book is about a naive 19-year-old girl named Sam. Sam has several problems in her life. It begins when Sam's boyfriend breaks up with her and she gets depressed about it. Sam has problems with her alcoholic mother and her mother's boyfriend. She finds an apartment to move into so she can get away from her mother. She also gets a new job as a topless dancer. Working at her new job, Sam is introduced to the drug heroin. It is her \\"magic potion\\" while she is dancing. The author gives vivid descriptions of Sam of how she feels when she shoots up. \\"As soon as he left, I danced another set, then went into the bathroom to shoot up again. And I did too much! My heart was racing like mad, almost jumping out of my chest, and I had to lie down on the floor to get myself back together. I felt like I was going to die. My ears closed up and my head felt all fuzzy. Then it slowed down and it was like I was fading away, leaving my body.

She pulls you into Sam's world and makes you feel empathy for her. (...)"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"\\"Beauty Queen\\" is not particularly impressive, even by the standards of a teen anti-drug novel. The protaganist, Sam, is archtypal - a teenaged girl with low self-esteem, from a broken home with an alchoholic mother. Her therapist advises her to move out, and she winds up stripping and being introduced to drugs.While I know that sometimes things do happen this way, the entire plot came across as incredibly contrived. The way she gets into heroin in the first place; the mobster with a big heart looking out for her; the loser, drug-dealing cop lover. She even has a diabetic cat, and is therefore already familiar with needles. Without revealing too much, one can see where everything is going and the part everyone plays in it almost from the start. It is less a self-destructive roller coaster ride than a plunge straight to hell from the very minute she moves out of her Mom's house: Sam literally cannot go even a journal entry without shooting some smack from the very day she starts using.If you are looking for anti-drug \\"smack fiction,\\" then go with \\"Smack.\\" The novel is much more sophisticated in terms of its character development and its plot, and furthermore one can learn a lot about 1980s British punk while reading it."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"i havent read a book since i was in school. i read this book and i felt like i was sam. i went thru everything that she had went thru. this book gave me so much inspiration on not to do heroin anymore, it's just so hard when the high is so great. i loved this book and recommend EVERYONE to read it!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"When 19-year-old Samantha Strasbourg is dumped by her boyfriend Teddy she thinks life is completely over.

Glovich's character, Samantha, however, comes across even more insipid that the &quot;anonymous&quot; author of &quot;Go Ask Alice.&quot;Samantha comes from a broken home; her divorced mother is an alcoholic who lives with a greasy ex-con who is always making sexual advances to Samantha. To escape from this nightmarish world of abuse and neglect, she becomes a stripper who quickly spirals downward into the seedy world of heroin addiction. What makes her entries so pathetic is that she continually refers to her drug as her &quot;magic potion&quot; and continuously gives herself injections in almost every entry. She does so much heroin that I was genuinely surprised that she didn't die about halfway through the book. I found myself feeling nothing for her or her predicament. Her insipid ramblings got so bad that I wanted to stop reading more than once, but I continued to read it in the hopes that it would get better, but I was wrong.The back cover features a quick note from Glovich which details her own struggle with heroin addiction as she wrote this book in order to experience the Hell that her young character experiences. It's too bad that Glovich didn't chronicle her own experience rather than try to attempt writing this YA novel. If _I_ were a young adult reading this book, I'd probably laugh all the way through it--_that's_ how poorly written it is. It's unfortunate that this book is so poorly written because its premise sounded so good.As a Children's Librarian I try to read as many Young Adult and Juvenile fiction as I can. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for _my_ library due to its poor quality."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Wow. I was really surprised by this book. I expected a story that stressed all the horrible things about drugs. Through the narrator Sam, the author tells a moving story about a 19 year old girl who seems so normal, despite the fact that she is a topless dancer and is addicted to heroin. I didn't really realize the full impact of the novel until the last few pages, when I was moved to tears; then the message comes through loud and clear. It's not my normal type of novel at all, but it was a good book for its subject material, and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I really liked this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to read fiction about drugs...well, even if you don't, I still recommend it. I couldn't put this book down. Sam, the 19 year-old girl who is writing, falls into heroin and deceit. She makes friends, but they only drag her deeper into the life that is destroying her. She falls in love with a guy who was a cop, and is wanted for arrest. Her new friend, Angelo, tries to keep her from him and keep her in a life that she should be living, and guides her and keeps their friendship alive. I loved this book and I think that anyone who reads it will, too."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"I am 17 years old and I was on herione. After reading the reviews, I couldn't believe that people didn't like this. Although I have been clean for two years, I remember what my life was like. This book was scary and hard to read for me because I have been there. I think it would be good for any one else because it's so realistic. It takes you to rock bottom but before you're caught, you put the book down. I think teens today should definatly read this book. It might give them a scare and they will never start drugs, once they realize how unglamourous the world truly is. It is not a happy story and if you expect to find one, I guess I can't say you'll like it, but if you want the &quot;real deal&quot; about living the life of a druggie, I reccomend it."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"If you like novels that grab your attention and deal with drugs use and abuse, Beauty Queen, by Linda Glovach, might be a great book for you. I rated this book a 5 because I could relate to it because one of my friends got hooked on drugs and she wouldn't let anyone help her.Another reason that I liked the book was because it grabbed my attention. It showed me that anyone could get hooked on drugs in a blink of an eye. Sam, the main character, gets caught up in drugs by her peers and ends up getting addicted. Sam wouldn't listen to her best friend Nicole, who was trying to help Sam get off drugs, but Sam said that she had slowed down a lot, which was a lie.A third reason why I liked this book is because the author's theme in this novel is so strong and true. The theme was to be careful whom you trust. Sam's boyfriend was playing around with her heart and playing Sam for a fool. All he wanted was to have sex and leave Sam hanging. Plus, he was a cop and was suspended from the force for raping a rape victim.In conclusion, you should always trust your true friends and listen to what they have to say. I think this novel would be a great story for anybody to read. You could learn a lot about how people think when they are under pressure and what foolish mistakes they can make."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"What a terribly sad tale of the downfall of such a beautiful young girl!The story demonstrates how parents' behavior can affect children. Maybe if Sam's mother had gone into therapy herself, the book would have had a different outcome.Throughout the book, you can see Sam's demise and eventual downfall but you want to hope that one of her friends gets through to her.The author, who obviously knows firsthand, shows all of the dangers that await young women and how they can be taken advantage of by others just by playing their emotions.A great cautionary tale for all!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"i've never been one to read a book on my own. this was the first full book i read for my own pleasure and i couldn't put it down. i've read it three times and would read it again... the story is amazing and keeps you intrigued. i would def recommend this book."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book could have been so much better. It seems like the author was too high off her Heroin addiction (read the back of the book) to make this a really good story. Everything was predictable and drab. I feel sorry for Sam but I did not feel for the character or the story as it progressed along."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Love is an emotion that often brings pain if you are not receiving it. While growing up as a child, there are so many overwhelming situations that one can undergo. When looking through the eyes of the main character in Beauty Queen, Samantha Strasburg, one can imagine the emotional stress, pain, and frustrations she feels. Imagine growing up without a father and living with a mother who uses alcohol to solve all of her problems. These are only two of the many difficulties Samantha must live with everyday. Samantha gets involved in the New York nightlife of fast money, quick highs, and throw away lives. Through Samantha's writings in her journal, the reader sees how living in the \\"fast lane\\" can destroy one's life. Samantha's journal shows how powerful denial, addiction, and depression can be on one's life.This is a wonderful book that touches on reality, while teaching the reader about different emotional and drug related situations. This book would be a great wake up call for students who are in the 8th grade and above. The realness of Beauty Queen may hit home for the students, as well as the parents. Teachers and parents could incorporate this book into a variety of subjects, including comprehensive health, social studies, science, and language arts."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"Since the reviews here already tell you what it's about, let me just put in my two cent about it. It is THE best book I have ever read. I checked it out from my library one morning just to get a grade for my English class. Little did I know I found my favorite book ever. I started reading it in my second class and finished that afternoon. I couldn't put it down! After I got done reading, I wanted more (It has a shocking ending, I'm not saying that it just leaves you hanging)! I told everyone about it. And, even though I already read it... I'm going to buy it just to have it around... I could honestly read it over 100 times... and still LOVE it!"},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book has a strong premise, but the story falters.You'd think an author who had been through heroin addiction would be able to write a more believable, gripping narrative, but that is not the case with Beauty Queen. Sam's journal entries peg her as naive and idealistic, and even in the throes of addiction, she remains unrealistically optimistic. You feel bad for her; not only for her situation, but for the fact that she remains so incredibly oblivious up until the end.This book is akin to Go Ask Alice, minus the introspection. It's a sugarcoated look at the world of heroin, probably most suited for younger, less discerning readers. It lacks the profane truth that i feel is nessacary for a story of this sort to really hit you... If you want a \\"nicer\\", more vague account, Beauty Queen is for you. It's worth reading once, but I'd recommend borrowing it from the library or buying it used."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"The back of the novel said that the author bought $1,500 worth of heroin, and started to shoot up 10 times a day.I guess her attempts to \\"feel\\" the story didn't work, because this is the worse book about Heroin I've ever read. It was so unrealistic I couldn't believe it. I've met 5 year olds less nieve than the main character. This book was terrible, and I regret wasting my time to read it.I guess I should have listened to what some of the reviews said, I thought people were exagerating when they said the book stunk.They weren't lying."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This book was so amazing...I had to do a boring book report for school this year and didn't want to read a book(im not a big reader)but the teacher made us go to the library since we also had to do an oral report on any book. I was looking to find a short story novel that was interesting but when I saw the hard cover of &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; and the picture on it I was curious to know what it was about...I took it out and started to read.It described how a young tennage girl struggles with her life being a heroin addict due to depression.Her mother was an alcohlic and her mother's boyfriend always tried to make sexual passes at her.She got a job as a topless dancer.There is where she started doing heroin since she was too scared to go on stage she felt as if the heroin gave her courage and strenth to dance. She ends up meeting a police officer and fall's in love.The police officer was also a drug addict and didn't know how to take care of girls.Sopposely his wife was led to her death since he was so unfaithful.This book was writting in diary entries and was soooo good...I would love to actually read this over and over..."},{"Title":"Beauty Queen","review":"This is a more teenage/tween level book.

I was right about that. I wasn't expecting too much from \\"Star: A Novel\\"...When I read it, I thought it was a good book. Obviously, it read very much like Pam's life...but it was setup like a novel, as opposed to an autobiography. With the book setup the way it was, it allowed Pam and her co-writer to make it fun to read. There were some parts in the book that were on the trashy side, but it never went too far and left some stuff for the imagination. This was good because it allowed a broad range of readers to read it without it being too smutty.I really enjoyed reading Star and I must say that it surpassed my expectations. It was a fun and light read and Pam did a good job with her first novel. I can't wait for \\"Star Struck: A Novel\\" to come out in August."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Fiction?

Who is Ant, though?Anyway, it's a great read. I do agree with one of the other reviewers that it seems a little rushed in the last few chapters. Given that she spent so much time on developing the character at the first of the book. If I didn't just read that she's writing the sequel, I'd be a lot more dissapointed because it didn't end well if that was her only one.

Definitley an inspirational book. Makes you realize that anything is possible, and alot of times the amazing, wonderful blessings life brings you, come when you least expect it. Five stars no doubt for \\"Star\\""},{"Title":"Star","review":"If you ever wanted to know Pamela Anderson's life story...Here's your chance!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"This book is very provacative and full of drama. Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down. It was able to keep my full attention at all times. It is a one of a kind novel only Pamela Anderson could give us!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I wasn't too impressed with this book. So she can tell someone to write a story, there's more to Pam then this b.s. I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping it would be more. I guess from all the hype I should have known it was a dud. Come one Pam, you can do better then a junior high quality story."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Yes I admit it, I enjoyed this book. It was cute and quirky and made me wonderwhat parts of the crazy plot she'd actually truly done. Although the last 50pages or so seemed to just zoom in to get the story told quickly, almost likethey felt they took too much time developing the story and decided (...)Ihave to wrap this up now.I will admit this book is not for the feint of heart when it comes tosensuality/sexuality. There are some hmmmm \\"group\\" scenes that might turnpeoples heads, so be forewarned before reading. If it was a movie rating it'dbe R to almost NC 17, as far as certain scenes go, but those are few and farbetween, however, this book is fun, quirky, and a little bit slutty, vicariousthrills are meant to be fun :) And that is what this is pure fun wrapped inpink wrapping.I rated it average because it literally just seemed to end. So I was bummed Iwanted to read more about the small town girl in the big bad city and all herexploits."},{"Title":"Star","review":"So this book was okay a little slow at first but it seemed really short towards the end because she squeezes so much into 250 pages. This book wasn't really that great, I guess the only thing that really kept me interested was the who's who of celebrities she was using, I kinda guessed everyone else but who were Peter and Van supposed to be? O and the baseball player and surfer? or were they made up???"},{"Title":"Star","review":"This story has potential, but I feel it was poorly written and underdeveloped. It simply lacks depth and reads more like something written on an 8th grade reading level. The last half of the book is filled with mostly Star (the main character) having sex with one character after another. You just never really get underneath the surface of the character and into her mind and how she deals with all the new found fame and fortune. I think it could have been a great story had it just dove deeper into the main character. Hopefully, there will be some improvements in the subsequent novels as I really would enjoy reading them."},{"Title":"Star","review":"No one takes Pamela seriously, because of the fake boobs and everything, but honestly, this is a classic. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me understand humanity that much better. In a world of superficiality, Pamela is the sole campaigner for a deeper, more contemplative way of life. In the end, when she choses to take the hemlock and die in an honorable way rather than suffer one more plastic surgery operation, I found myself sobbing. Truly, this woman has hit upon a universal seed of truth."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I understand that not everyone is going to like this book. Normally I am a reader of more complex fiction, such as the books of Donna Tart or Michael Cunningham, but being a gay man I could not resist reading the first novel by the fabulous Pam Anderson. This book is way over the top, but if you were unable to tell that by just glancing at the cover I seriously have to worry about your IQ points. And speaking of IQ points, you definately will not earn any by reading this, but you will definately have a good laugh and a lot of fun telling your friends about it. Everyone needs to lighten up, get down off their high horse and realize that it is summer, and this is definately a summer book! A message for Pam Anderson, if she happens to read this review....Hurry up and write the second book, you cant leave Star sitting in that bathtub to long!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I was VERY impressed with this book. I was skeptical when I bought it...and I finished it in 2 days...that is a record for me! Keep up the good work Pam!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"Great Read.. I couldn't put it down. I got the book as a birthday present, if I had not I would have definetly bought it myself. I recommended it to all my friends and now we are waiting for a sequel. The book puts you in a fantasy world every girls true dream - lived out by one exceptional and lucky woman. Go- Pamela!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"This book was great, condensed version of Pamela Anderson rise from small town girl to super sexy goddess. The most fun was figuring out who the \\"fictional\\" characters were and trying to figure out how much of the book was \\"fiction\\". Unfortunately, the book ended when she meets a bad boy rocker who licks her face right before her photo shoot in Mexico - hmmm- can't wait for Star2 - she can't leave us hanging."},{"Title":"Star","review":"How could such an exciting life make for such a boring book. If you're going to hire a ghost writer, wouldn't you find a good one? I couldn't wait to read this book. Then I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to something better. I expected trashy fun, but this was really a disappointment. Mundane, uneven, stupid.... truly a waste of time."},{"Title":"Star","review":"The Hollywood dialogue and the quick changing of people without any recognizable descriptions, made it impossible to get into. Hard to imagine a professional 'ghost writer' having anything to do with this, as it sounded too illiterate. I tried hard, several times to get passed the first chapters, and glimpsed through hoping the grammar would improve, along with the storyline, but it became worse.............. I think she pretends not to know much, so that the little girl act supposedly makes men feel protective of her. No adult can be so simple, without being simple. Everyone says it is really her autobiography, but who knows? I do not believe anyone can have such a lack of morals, as this main character............I shall never buy anything Ms Anderson has written again. Boring, hard to understand, all over the place, no decent storyline, uninteresting characters who are impossible to care about, etc etc.,Donni-Jay (author)"},{"Title":"Star","review":"But, when I finished it, I decided that liking it, even slightly, wasn't really an option.I am giving it two stars for her effort. Writing a book is hard (granted, it's easier when you have a ghostwriter) and for Pam's first book she gave it a valliant try.The book's tempo isn't steady, which makes it rather confusing to read. Events aren't focused on enough, or consequently focused on too much, and this makes it difficult to discern what the important things are.Maybe if she just wrote a tell-all book about the people she's slept with rather than turning it into a poorly-written novel, I would be more entertained."},{"Title":"Star","review":"As the story started out I was entertained by the book. The further I got in though, the more boring it got. I found the whole thing very repititive. Star meets a producer, automatically gets a part, meets a new guy and sleeps with him, all way something really stupid things that make everyone give her \\"is she for real?\\" looks.The second half of the book is nothing but sex, sex, and more sex, and the writing style isn't even that creative. Her metaphors and descriptions are all cring worthy. Even the sex scenes are repititve.If Pam Anderson really wanted to write an autobiography she just should have written one. It would have been a lot more interesting."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this book. I found it to be a light, easy read. Perfect for summer time reading. I thought it was so funny to see the similarities between Star and Pam, and see how the names and places were disguised. I thought it ended rather abruptly, until I realized there was a second book out. I will definitely purchase that one as well. As for some of the graphic scenes? No worse than any of the other trashy novels out there, or most of the 'R' rated movies out nowadays. At least she wasn't trying to hide where she came from."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Okay. so Star was a pretty good book. I was skeptical about but I bought it, read it and really liked it. I will read Starstruck. Hopefully the stories will continue because Pam is a good storyteller! I guess its true that real life is weirder than fiction!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"A fun and frivilous read for light entertainment. A thinly veiled account of Pamela Anderson's rise to fame. On par with Jackie Collins."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Since my attention span with two young kids at home is next to nothing, the great works of literature are simply not on my reading menu right now! This book was trashy and interesting enough to hold my interest and read quickly. Plus, being a Tommy Lee fan much more than a Pam fan, this book gave a glimpse into the woman he loved so much. Yup, it' a lil cheesy, but those who down it are too stuck up to admit to liking trashy books once in a while. Worth the price and the time!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I thought this would be alot more interesting that it was. I was upset I had spent the time that I had on the book, and don't bother looking for a good ending it kind of drifted off into la-la land somewhere, and that's where it ended. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Pam Anderson is such a self-effacing Hollywood commodity that I foolishly expected more from this book...at least some humor or insight into the self-manufactured showbiz machine she has become. Instead, this is a hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time without even a satirical or titillating plotline to make you want to turn the page. It actually IS a book you can put down. It doesn't manage to fall into the category of beach reading, although you might want to throw it in the ocean.Pam deserves better....Her co-writer could have come up with something more Jackie Collins-esque. Was the BAYWATCH babe playing it too safe, trying to straddle the fence between sexpot and respectable author? I think probably so. Too bad for her readers and/or fans. If the subject matter weren't so distasteful, it would suit the pre-teen girl demographic but instead it is just a story adrift."},{"Title":"Star","review":"This is the story of Star Wood Leigh, a nave, small-town girl who finds fame and fortune through a series of purely coincidental, unplanned events. Chapter one is interesting enough - a fairly cute intro with a gratuitous lesbian encounter thrown in as a hook. But unfortunately for Star, the line between being nave and being too-dumb-to-live gets crossed too many times, and her story quickly turns from cute to just plain stupid. After the first few chapters I put this book down several times and walked away for days on end as it became increasingly (for lack of a better word) lame.The story takes a major downhill slide when Star arrives in Hollywood, at which time wealthy men throw themselves at her, she lands television roles without even trying, and has sex with every guy in town. In short, we have a hollow character who is ridiculously beautiful, with ridiculous good fortune, who ends up ridiculously rich and famous. Nothing bad ever happens to her, unless you want to count her disappointment in the outcome of her breast augmentation surgery (I'm not kidding here).This novel has been described as semi-autobiographical, which translates to an autobiography in which the famous names and television shows have been changed to laughable substitutes, like her becoming the \\"Hammer Time Girl\\" and the star of \\"Lifeguards, Inc.\\" Really, if she wanted to write a memoir, she should have just done it, and spared us this silliness.I might have been willing to say \\"nice attempt by a celebrity author,\\" if not for the fact that a ghostwriter put this mess together. Knowing that a presumed professional was responsible for the prose makes it all the more embarrassing. There were times when I wanted to rip my hair out from the bad grammar and painfully redundant use of certain words and phrases. I actually bought this book based on some positive reviews I had seen in respected publications. Now I have to wonder if those reviewers actually read the book, or were simply giving two thumbs up to the naked photo of Pam on the inside of the dust cover, which is probably the single best reason for buying the thing."},{"Title":"Star","review":"\\"Star : A Novel\\" by Pamela Anderson is a fun read, don't expect too much and then you'll be satisfied. It is riveting but not enthralling. Pam chooses to 'loosely' base this novel on her life while they are many similarities; I don't know the exact details of her past so I couldn't place what was 'loosely based' and what was manufactured. I think I would have enjoyed it more if she had the courage to give us more details and name drop a heck of a lot more. You can tell who is who in some cases but the ones I couldn't place frustrated me.Still, Star Wood Leigh's tale is a fun beach read!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I'm not afraid to admit that I have been a fan of Pamela Anderson for the last 15 years or so. I'm sure I'm not the only male who is/was mesmerized by Ms. Anderson's \\"charms.\\" I ordered this book since she mentioned it was loosely based on her life. Although I knew most of the facts of her career since she made it big, it was interesting to get them in a more \\"personalized\\" point of view. Some details were not known to me at all (such as the time before the fame) & in some cases one had to \\"read between the lines.\\" This was a fairly easy read, something very light. I was looking for some pulp fiction to read while I was at work. It doesn't require deep concentation or anything. Easy read, with a good writing style, but I still think the book could have been better. If you were expecting some deep philosophical truths, psychological revelations or some innovative literary work, you are most definitely in the wrong section!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"Oh,,Ohh,,Ohhh!!! How I love Pamela Anderson! She is incredibly sexy,,smart,,yes,,I said smart (don't let her bombshell looks fool you) and I love this book! It is a great read and you really get to delve into more of her life as a person in a non-fictional/fictional way. Very creative! The inside of the cover isn't bad either. Enjoy Pamela and Enjoy \\"Star.\\" It's an extremely light read when you're in the mood to relax."},{"Title":"Star","review":"This was a great book. It was what I expected it to be, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. I am a fan of Pam (especially when she is on Howard Stern) so I would like her book. People who don't know who the heck she is might still like it. It's loosely based on her life, although I would like to think it's all true :-)WOW. Some life. It was a rather short novel. This would be a great beach, or vacation read. It did lure me in to buying the second book 'Star Struck' here on Amazon as well... Great deal too I think I payed 1 penny for the book and $3.99 for shipping!! Overall interesting, and exciting."},{"Title":"Star","review":"This book was suprisingly great. ive been a fan of pam's for a while, and i was very impressed by this book. while its not a literary masterpiece, its funny, witty,sexy, and overall entertaining.(:"},{"Title":"Star","review":"Like many of the other reviews I've read on this page, I also had high expectations when reading about the fabulous lifestyle of Pamela Anderson and how she made her mark in Hollywood. But unfortunately, like many of the other reviews I read, I was extremely disappointed. I'll skip the minor details, but one of the main (and many) flaws I found with this read was the character herself! I hardly found her lovable (try, ditsy), I certainly didn't find her innocent (Bentley, Hollywood sign, Castle grounds-need I say more?) and she apparently made her mark based on luck, hardly brains. Obviously if you can hardly stand the heroine you're not going to enjoy reading about her... That aside, I also found the writing style seemed to make a lot of mistakes that just couldn't be overlooked.. I'll finish up by saying I wasn't disappointed to put it down when it was finished (I could even go with 'relieved') and I didn't think twice about skipping the look into \\"Starstruck.\\" I would not recommend this book to anybody who didn't deserve it."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I really had a fun time reading this book. It's very sexy, racy... it's not meant to be an award winning book. Just something fun and light to read, and I absolutely enjoyed it. I found myself rooting for Star even after she settled in Hollywood heavily involved in all different kinds of men. Nonetheless, I recommend this book to anyway who enjoys a sexy-hollywood/glamorous easy read. Can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I actually did like this book. I am now reading Starstruck and I think it is cute how she wrote it. I don't think she should have used big impressive words. She was just writting how she wanted to. She is already rich enough, so she was just doing it as a hobby I'm sure. I do kind of wish she would have made it her full autobiography. But in the end I like how she wrote it.She was just vulnerable and it shows what Hollywood does to people. Throughout the whole book I was intrigued by what Star did and how she went on to becoming a Star. I loved it.Go Pam! Some people know how to open their minds... Promise."},{"Title":"Star","review":"While walking through the bookstore, I made a rather nasty comment about Pamela Anderson writing a book. Two of the stores employees overheard me and assured me that I needed to read it to believe it. They said it was excellent, wonderful, etc. Upon their advice, I bought it. They must have been thinking about another book, because this was horrible. I only give it two stars because she managed to keep me somewhat interested in the plot in order to keep reading."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Wow! What did all you people expect from her a classic????? I personally thought the book was done very tastefully and funny. It is a fast read and enjoyable. It lets you see a side of her that is not obviously seen very often. I am not a Pamela Anderson fan, I mean I do not dislike her at all, but I never watched any of her shows or movies. But she is an interesting person so I got the book. I thought the book was good. A fun read!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I loved this book! i thought it was interesting to see what it was like to go from being a normal person to being a celebrity,Any fan of Pam will love this book! I alos loved Star Struck and I can't wait until the next book comes out!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"This book was the best. I couldn't put it down. Every night I read some and could never find a good spot to stop where nothing was happening. I now think Pam is more then a great looking blonde that sits and acts pretty but that she's got it all;the smarts and the body. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I really like Pam, in every interview I've seen she's funny, witty and surprisingly intelligent. I'm thrilled she uses her celebrity to help various animal causes. When I saw she released a book I was quite excited. After reading it I must say I'm filled with disappointment. Don't read it unless you want almost 300 pages of self appreciation from her. I really did expect more from her, especially since she used a ghost writer."},{"Title":"Star","review":"To begin, let me state that I not only finished the book, but I finished it in a weekend...meaning it was not \\"too horrible to get through\\" as others have said.I found the story entertaining and interesting. It (like most autobiographical works) definitely portrays Star as one dimensional, a sort of 'perfectly unselfish' person. As it has been said in many of the reviews, what ruined the good story for me was the ending. I felt like someone met a word count quota and then realized it and decided to wrap up the book in two pages.I was really looking forward to the part of her life while dating Tommy Lee, the famous video, having kids, Tommy in jail, and Kid Rock. Unfortunately the book abruptly stops around the time of meeting Tommy Lee. That was my biggest disappointment.The whole book was building up to the part of her life that most people are familiar with, but are interested in hearing her side of the story. Unfortunately it builds up to that but stops before climax, unlike her so many well detailed escapades."},{"Title":"Star","review":"This is a cheesy, steamy, FUN novel. It was just what I needed this weekend.Star is obviously autobiographical in parts. (As she gets comfortable with her newfound fame, for example, she contacts an animal rights group to see how her fame can help them.) It's written light, and funny. Reading this book made me admire Ms. Anderson more, because she is obviously not a bit of prettu fluff, but a clever, multi-faceted woman.I highly recommend STAR. I gave a copy as a gift, and would do so again."},{"Title":"Star","review":"While I appreciate other readers thoughts on this book, personally I really was suprised at how good this book was, in a Jackie Collins sort of way.It was a fun, mindless read that was easy to digest. Most of the fun was in trying to figure out what was real from Anderson's life, and what was fiction!I would have to say that I'll read the sequel. Sometimes it's fun to pick up a book that doesn't make you think to hard, this was one that can be taken to the beach and enjoyed while drinking your rum punch."},{"Title":"Star","review":"i was excited to read this book. I would only advise fans of Pam to NOT read this \\"Judy Blumeseque\\" psuedobiography. I expected a bit more. Try Jenna Jameson's book instead."},{"Title":"Star","review":"If Pam had actually written this herself, I may have given it two stars. BUT to think she hired a \\"ghost writer\\" and STILL managed to release this horrid piece of work(?) is a shame to the book world. I had such high hopes as I think Pam is so adorable, clever and witty...but this was AWFUL. The ending was great because I was done with it, but what a pathetic, un-wrapped-up ending as well. PLEASE do not even think of comming up with a continued part. Stick to cutsie acting and know when to cut your book losses."},{"Title":"Star","review":"As with most things that bear the name, or image, of \\"Pamela Anderson,\\" this book has tremendous appeal, from its double-sided sultry sleeve to its 294 pages of prose, the latter of which undoubtedly leaves one sorely trying to dissect fact from fiction.I read this book in one sitting-I simply could not, would not, put it down until I reached the end. The text kept egging me on; I wanted, dare say needed, to see how the life of the main character, Star Wood Leigh, played out. And, I kept comparing Star's experiences to those publicized instances in Pam's life, wondering how closely the two paralleled one another.At the bottom line, this book tells an incredible story: the ups and downs of a stellar woman who rose from small beginnings to reach a physical beauty and glory that reflected her true inner self, an inner self marked by the culmination, perchance antithetical, of true depth, innocence, and loneliness.One cannot read Anderson's novel without feeling for Star and cheering for Star. Star Wood Leigh is a new age heroine, exposing her vulnerability, doubt, and frustration more than she revealed her body.Yet, while Anderson's book is jacketed in a perfect image which cloaks a story which has the same tremendous appeal, the novel is not without flaw. My biggest gripe is in the pacing of the novel. In my opinion, the last few chapters seem a tad rushed. After painstaking attention to details-to conversations and emotions-throughout an approximate 200 pages of the novel, the pace quickens considerably, rushing through months of Star's life in mere paragraphs, which, comparatively, are poorly written, and silent as to a lot of the emotive webs which Anderson earlier spun to intricately develop Star's character.Indeed, there are a few spots in the earlier chapters where certain events seem to be quickly disposed of in a manner that both begs questions that remain unanswered and creates a riff in the logical progression of the story. Yet, such instances are not nearly as grave as the accelerated pace of the final chapters.That said, however, the rapidity does not destroy the story-it just leaves one with more questions and unnerves the staunchest of literary buffs. All in all, I find this novel, with perks and flaws included, a great entry into the literary world and commend Anderson for her terrific effort and contribution.I can barely wait for the next installment (and am sure that Anderson will abate any flaws in later works, as she shall surely continue to grow as a person and as an author)."},{"Title":"Star","review":"If your a Pamela Anderson fan or if your just looking for a good read, buy this book. It's a steamy and interesting autobiography."},{"Title":"Star","review":"So I bought this book like 3 days ago and I'm almost done with it. It's not a horrible book. Not by far, I've read book that were horrible, and some written by accomplished authors. But, because Pamela used a GHOSTWRITER, I assumed it would be written in a better prose than I used when I was in the 8th grade.Writing style aside, I acquired a love/hate relationship with the main character Esther \\"Star\\" Wood Leigh. At times she is lovable, but other time I want to strangle her. Star basically humps everything that moves, and has no common sense at all. Even people who hail from the smallest town in Booniesville, Hickstown know what baggage check is.Also I know it was suppose to be cute, but it irked the crap out of me that every chapter was a song title, and Star encounters the song within the chapter.Don't get me wrong, I intent to finish this novel, and I may even read Star Struck, but it still gets me annoyed every once in a while."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I love the book. I can't wait to read the sequel. I hope I don't have to wait to long. I couldn't put this book down. It is so interested to hear how the other half lives. I am such a huge fan of Pamela Anderson. Great Job Pamela."},{"Title":"Star","review":"In Florida, Esther Wood Leigh was dubbed \\"Star\\" by her best friend when they learned from a Streisand movie that Esther means star in Hebrew. Star spent her school years hiding her intelligence from her friends acting the cutup though she received straight \\"A\\"s in her classes. She works days at Talon's Nail and Tan Spa and nights at Mother Pearl's Steak and Oyster Emporium. Star enjoys her life though she would prefer more time playing volleyball or having wild sex with her boyfriend, but believes something is missing.Star attends a Dolphins game with her friend Brandi and a few other pals. That leads to accompanying Brandi on a photo shoot at Visage Studios. The photographers take shots of Star too because they think she is beautiful. Suddenly over night, a Star is born as she graces the cover of Mann Magazine, ends up with a guest role on the TV show Hammer Time, and finally becomes a sensation on the show Lifeguards. Star wonders if playing the role for her fans and the media as a dumb blond pinup with \\"no\\" brains all the way to the bank is worth it?This not so disguised biographical fiction is a well written fun tale that shows not only does Pamela Anderson have the ability to write, but as she did with her series VIP, she satirizes her life as few authors can. The story line is amusing as Ms. Anderson pokes fun at her rise to \\"fluffy\\" fame and the media frenzy while also thanking her fans though ironically wondering why her. Chick lit fluff to a degree, but with a wonderful self deprecating humorous bent that will have readers appreciating this STAR.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I got to the part where Star smokes pot with a friend and the friend procedes to diddle with her private parts. From there, I stood up, walked to the trash can and threw the book away. Even though the little I read was not well written, I wanted to get through it, but I saw where the book was going and knew I didn't want to go there. Whether you like this book will depend on what kind of person you are. If you are open to anything and everything sexually, this will probably be a great read. For the more conservative person, I don't think so."},{"Title":"Star","review":"&quot;Inspired&quot; by her own life - from growing up on a small island to her life with the rock star elite, Pamela Anderson provides an insightful look into this fascinating world. Ms. Anderson tastefully describes her upbringing, trials and tribulations during adolescence. In the book, Star Wood Leigh, who lives on a small Florida Key, works two jobs - at a sea food restaurant, and at Talon's Nail and Tan Spa - and is stuck in an abusive relationship with her high school boyfriend. I was moved by her ability to aptly and with heartfelt emotion give the reader such an honest and inspiring message. Five out of five stars barely justifies the almost poetic merit this piece delivers."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I absolutely was surprised to find that Pam Anderson's novel was actually quite good. I had no doubt that it would be &quot;fun&quot;--how could it not be, just look at the woman--anything she does seems like fun! But, as I started reading the book, I found myself wanting to know what happens next. I had a great time playing with the game of &quot;who's who&quot; in Hollywood, trying to place the characters in the book with those who are real in the entertainment world (it's obvious that Marsten Mann is Hugh Heffner, for example--initials are duplicate and everyone calls him &quot;Mars&quot; just like everyone calls the Playboy mogul &quot;Heff&quot;). In any case, I loved this book and can't wait for the next one, hopefully out for summer next year."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Star Wood Leigh is the star of this biography/novel. Star and her life are based, to some extent, on Pamela. By taking this approach, Pamela can take parts of her life and experiences and spice them up with some fiction and a plot. Does it work? Well, that really needs to be left up to the reader.The revealing cover with its strategically placed stars will appeal to a certain segment of the population. The fact that the cover is two-sided and can be reversed to reveal a star-free version tells you where this book is aimed. Although sometimes compared to chick-lit, real chick-lit would not pull such a stunt.If you are a Pamela Anderson fan you will surely enjoy the book and you will probably substitute Pamela's name for Star's as you read it. While not for everyone, this is bound to be a big seller."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I thought this would be a fun and interesting book to read and would be entertaining, but it was just a drag. There were a couple of interesting moments and some spicy sex, but between those few moments, I just felt that the book dragged on. There seemed to be big holes in the story that left me unsatisfied, and the ending really sucked. I only liked guessing who the celebrities were that she changed the names of - Like Tommie Toms is actually Marky Mark, and Salty Keller is actually Kelly Slater! That is why I gave it 2 stars. But this book is really cheesy and I liked Pam more BEFORE I read the book. This makes her seem like a bigger TRAMP than I thought she was. Don't waste your money. Plus there were so many grammatical and punctuation errors, It gave me the impression that it was never proofread!!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I just arrived home from a book signing for Pamela Anderson's book, STAR, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised not only by the book itself, but by the lady who wrote it. I didn't dive very far into the book, but from what I have read, it's not going to be long until I finish it. It's one of those &quot;just can't put it down&quot; novels.I found the author (who signed my copy of STAR)to be more beautiful in person, and seemed sweet.

I really wanted to like it too, but it was all over the place. In the beginning, Star is described as a natural athlete who is super smart, then she is described as not a natural at anything but a really dedicated hard worker, and finally, she is described as someone who didn't work hard enough and wasn't really good at anything. And that's just in the first five chapters! I just can't figure out why nobody else picked up on all of the inconsistencies. (That was just one example!) I know this is fiction, and I have to give Anderson credit for writing a book, but it comes off as unpolished, and I really blame whoever told her that it was ready for print. A little bit more time and it could have been a really entertaining read! Don't waste your time, it's not worth it. And Pam, if you are going to write another book, find a new ghost writer and editor!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I purchased this after seeing some favorable comments and knowing that it was a thinly veiled story of her life. And for the first few chapters it does have promise as this pretty, unworldly girl gets exposed to a life of which she never dreamed. But Pam is more than beautiful although she needs to drop most of the makeup and return to her original \\"girl next door\\" look. She has an engaging personality that comes across on screen and on guest spots such as Howard Stern. Her appeal is very \\"Marilyn Monroe-esque\\": Beauty, lust and cute charm when she opens her mouth.But that only goes so far as everyone she meets in LA loves her, wants to help her, and also wants to sleep with her. And right when the book should be the most exciting, it becomes too repetitive. She goes from the small town girl you root for to the, well, the Pam Anderson caricature of herself that she currently is.Did I like some parts of this book? Yes. But they are few and far between as the book goes on and I was happy to finish the book. Forget the hype. Don't read this book unless you have a specific interest in Pam Anderson. I agree with other reviewers. If you're going to write an autobiography, just right it."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Initially I was really looking forward to reading this book because I've always been intrigued by Ms. Anderson. I heard rumors that the book was supposed to be \\"losely autobiographical\\" so I expected the book to consist of an intense story and at least some sort of substance.Instead this book is worse than a romance novel. In fact most romance novel authors could write something better than this book in their sleep. There didn't seem to be any depth to it. It just went on and on about how people tried to \\"stand in Star's way, but with luck things just worked out\\". The book depicts \\"Star\\" as this \\"incredibly innocent\\" young girl from Florida who makes it to the big city of LA and just takes it by storm because people are just so intrigued by how innocent she is.Sorry but I just could buy the story. Even the most naive people have more sense than this character.I really don't like the message that this book sends - what's scary is that something tells me that Anderson really saw herself as this character.The only good thing about this book is that it's a fast and easy read that a 13 year old could easily comprehend. In fact I have a feeling that most 13 year olds would even think that aside from the weak sex scenes this is more of a \\"fairy tale\\" than anything else.This book has totally slanted my once positive view of Anderson. If she is ANYTHING like this character, it just tells me that she's willing to \\"go with it\\" regardless of the situation just to \\"see what happens\\" rather than actually thinking something through. Being spontaneous is fine but COME ON!The last thing I'm gonna say about this book is that what irritated me the most was the complete lack of effort put into it. Anderson - I get that you want to make some money the \\"legit\\" way, but at LEAST hire a better co-writer who will actually make your book worth while."},{"Title":"Star","review":"OMG I was so interested in reading this book until I got to the about the 40th page. I couldn't stand anymore HOW stupid Pamela Anderson made this Star turn out to be. This book also jumped all over the place. It was the most boring, unintelligable piece of trash I have ever read in my life. Matter of fact it's still sitting on my floor where I threw it 2 weeks ago."},{"Title":"Star","review":"This book is just living proof of the (...)and sell-out of celebrity today and the major publishing companies, who should be hung for publishing trash like this and calling it works of serious fiction. Hemingway, Faulkner and Orwell amongst others have to be tossing in their grave. As God awful that Star is, it's even more fake (than Pam's breasts) to think she actually had any hand in putting a sentence into this work. I can see her now after a long hard day, firing up the computer and writing and writing, the whole five minutes she probably put into this crap. (...)"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I purchased this book after seeing Ms. Anderson's interview about it on NBC's Today Show. I have had a bit of a fascination with Pamela since she first hit the celeb circuit because though she is pretty, she has a certain \\"something\\" other than her looks that is hard to ignore. Sort of like a train wreck.I was ready to put this book down and walk away after reading the first chapter. Even though Pamela had a ghost writer help her, the story read like a 12 year old's diary. Then, after the second chapter, it started to get funny. By the third chapter there were some pretty profound things coming out of the character's mouth that made me wonder if there was indeed more depth to Pamela Anderson than we have been privy to all these years.Star Wood Leigh is a sweet, nave girl from a small town. She happens upon fame through a series of lucky breaks and coincidences. The story takes us through her learning the ropes of Hollywood including many, many sexual escapades. Some of it is quite graphic. I found myself bored with a lot of the mundane details of her daily life which seemed to be included only as filler between the hot, racy parts. The most fun I think I had reading this book though was figuring out the \\"real\\" names of the people and places Star was encountering. Some funny ones are \\"Mann Magazine\\", the fictitious adult magazine started by \\"Marsten Mann\\" for the real magazine, Playboy and the famous rock star named \\"Jimi Deed\\".I agree with some of the other reviewers here that mention that the book has inconsistencies. One example would be how she was talking about one of her sexual conquests and she said he really cared enough for her to make sure she had an \\"O\\" too. But then on the very next line she described his lovemaking as selfish. Too many contradictions throughout the story. Also, the story didn't really have an ending. It just seemed like everyone simply got tired of writing and just quit.I really don't know why Pamela didn't just write an actual autobiography instead of this \\"fictitious\\" novel. Her life was all played out in the tabloids anyway; so much of what we read about this character Star didn't surprise me.Maybe now that the drivel is out of her system, Pamela will write a real book about her struggles as a mom and her health concerns and where she is going to go from here. In the meantime, read this book for some fun and escapism."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I am giving this book 5 stars because \\"Star\\" is a fun beach book read. Very enjoyable page-turner. A great way to beat the heat this Summer....buy Star, find a cool spot and lose yourself in the story for a few hours. Lots of bang for your entertainment buck. I don't expect Star to win any awards for classic lit. But, this book is 5-star fun in the sun."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Star is a fictionalized account of Pamela Anderson's life and tells her story with various names and places thinly veiled for privacy reasons. Star is the name of her character in the book. Her rise to fame apparently began one day when she attended a baseball game. Somehow that baseball game turned into a photo shoot where Star was the make-up artist. Her supposed good friend Brandi was the model for the shoot, but for some reason didn't live up to the expectations of the photographer. However, Star's good friends Billy and Skip got some pictures of Star herself, much to Brandi's disgust and jealousy, and somehow those pictures ended up in the hands of Jayne Hersfield, the executive editor of Mann Magazine.One thing led to another and Star was offered a cover shoot for Mann magazine. So she had to leave behind her childhood lover/boyfriend Adam and rural Florida where she'd been all her life and fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. And thus began her career. The rest, of course, is history. The story goes on to describe how she nearly instantly became an icon, went on to bed hop with many famous men, attend orgies, and much more.So, just how bad was this book? I can't begin to cover all the things about it I didn't like. But I'll try. First of all, the author tries WAY too hard to show how sweet and innocent Star is before her foray into modeling. Why, the sweet country bumpkin didn't even know what \\"Check Your Baggage\\" meant, (\\"What are you checking them for?\\") or what a \\"Blimp field\\" was, (\\"You mean they grow blimps in fields??\\") or that LAX is an airport. Come ON. I GET IT ALREADY. This way over-done effort to have Star appear innocent goes on throughout the book and frankly makes Star appear to be a complete and total moron. It's as though someone hands you a piece of pie and tells you it is sweet. When you might appear to be disbelieving, the pie is then smeared in your face and shoved down your throat violently until you decide to agree that yes, it is sickly sweet after all. (To the point of gagging.)What made it hard to get through the first several chapters was the vague, choppy storytelling. There were too many characters in various scenes that weren't properly introduced into the story, making it confusing to figure out who was who. Once the story did get moving, things were a little better. However, this book, sad to say, appears to have been written by a 10 year old! There are no surprises, no skilled or enticing prose, and no solid plot (other than the recounting of what really happened in her life) to make someone continue reading. However, I continued because I knew I had to finish the book in order to review it.After reading the first 4 chapters of the book, I began to seriously wonder who this book was marketed for. First off, there is a reversible cover which shows Pamela Anderson as close to nude as a book can get, which I discovered by accident when I removed the cover (as I usually do while reading hard-cover books.) Second, there is almost immediately a girl-on-girl love scene, which isn't the kind of thing that most women look for in a book. Third, if a guy picked up this book to read to find out about Pamela Anderson's life, they'd be bored stiff because of the girly plot. So I ask, who was this book marketed for?Overall, it is safe to say that I did not like this book, and won't be recommending it to anyone. And I seriously doubt this book would have been published had it not been written by a celebrity."},{"Title":"Star","review":"Pam, vegetarians don't eat tuna nor use sable hair brushes for sexual gratification or other purposes. This book is an easy read, it reminded me of the 70s to early 80s teen books that were over simplified to drive home a point. I guess you can't expect brain surgery from someone working at a fast food chain..."},{"Title":"Star","review":"It's very rare for me to struggle through any book; I love all kinds of books. But this book was VERY hard to get through. I wanted to like it,I don't have anything against Pamela Anderson,but wow,there were SO many problems. Inconsistencies, even typing errors such as one part where they name the boyfriend instead of the woman he's seeing as being married. A few times the writing itself made no sense. One sentence I read to 3 different people and they all just shook their heads in confusion. Poor editing. As for the writing, the comparisions to her life are so obvious it's a little ridiculous. I don't understand why she didn't just write a biography, it would've been more interesting. The character of Star is so \\"I am so dumb it's cute\\" - it's like they're trying TOO hard to make her a comical ditz - thinking they're making fun of a stereotype but it's not done in a very witty way. Even the sex scenes feel contrived and uncomfortable. Towards the end they're still developing plot when there are only a few pages left, then it abruptly ends. I hope Pamela's next book is written better, maybe a better editor or better help is needed. A big let down!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I'm not really a reader but I couldn't seem to put this book down. For you Pam Anderson fans, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I thought that maybe, just maybe, Ms. Anderson would show some hidden literary talent. After all, the book actually got published and there was some hype about it, but I guess I was completely wrong. If an unknown person had submitted this to a publishing house, it would have never gone to press. This may not be the worst book I ever read, but it definitely rates right up there."},{"Title":"Star","review":"I thought the book was wonderful. Granted I wasn't quiet sure why she changed all the names in the book it was obvious it was all about her, so it should have been an autobiography. But I absolutely loved it. I loved her before and this doesn't make me think any less of her. I can't wait to read Star Struck!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"If you sit back in your lounge chair with your cocktail on a cool breezy July evening, this book is really good. It's a one-sitting read, no doubt. It took me the whole weekend but I wanted to really absorb all that Pam is.I think this book was full of very solid material. It was well written and it's the first time that a co-written book thrilled me like this one did. I usually feel that more of the co-writer's opinion is involved less than the one who is supposed to be writing the book. But this time I really felt that this was Pam writing.I look forward to digging into the next installment!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"I promised myself that I wouldn't bother reading this book, not because I dislike Pamela Anderson, but mainly because I had seen her on a late night TV talk show wherein she openly admitted that the premise of the novel was basically the story of her life, albeit with a little bit of fiction thrown in. Given that the hyper-mammiferous Ms. Anderson is virtually everywhere these days, I felt as though I had a handle on the basics of her life and her rise to \\"stardom\\". Unfortunately; however, I became desperate for something to read at the beach this summer, and given that the sequel to this book - \\"Starstruck\\" - had just been released at the time, I found the books together as a package deal. Some deal --- I'm lucky I didn't get third degree burns on the beach as a result of falling asleep while reading. I truly believe that the only reason I continued to read both till the end was because 1) I had paid for them and didn't wish to see them go to waste 2) I was bored and 3) I kept thinking that there had to be more, it had to get better somewhere and that something would happen that would finally grab my attention....the only thing that truly grabbed my attention was that she is even more sexually active than I originally gave her credit for - and that's going some!!!! Her head has seen more pillows than a chocolate mint. Needless to say, \\"Star\\" was a tedious and highly uneven read.....some parts were so overly descriptive yet unnecessary that I was just about willing to abandon the beach and feed myself to the sharks - while other areas, in particular toward the end of the book, was so rushed that I felt as though I had missed something along the way. Her journey from her hometown in the Florida Keys - yeah, right - we all know she's Canadian - seemed to take up to a third of the book, yet somehow for a small town girl, who according to her story is was somewhat sheltered and shy, made the transition to multiple lovers and group sex in a matter of just a few pages. \\"Starstruck\\" did, in fact, manage to stay on a slightly more even keel, but only because it dealt with virtually nothing else but sex and paparazzi. The ending, which I won't give away because I'm sure there are some of you still willing to read it, was certainly unforeseen, so I must commend her and her ghost writer on the shock factor. However, it was disapppointing nonetheless. Surprisingly, for a woman who thought nothing of telling all her readers exactly whom she has slept with over the years (the references were so thinly-veiled they are laughable), and for a story that was very close to truth, it was almost as if she suddenly didn't want to deal with reality, so ended with pure fiction. Is the way she wishes her marriage had ended? Who knows? Moreover - who cares!!"},{"Title":"Star","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I am literally struggling to get through it. The main character is the most naive idiot and the dialogue is unbearable. She doesn't know what the minibar in her hotel is.

This reader of philosophy by John Randall, Justus Buchler and Evelyn Shirk is not a systematic treatment of philosophy, nor is it a consistent and in depth analysis of particular fields or schools of philosophy. Rather, it is a broadly drawn and wide ranging collection of readings covering almost the entire field of philosophy.This book is meant to be a companion to the volume 'Philosophy: an Introduction', published as part of the same series. That text covers the field of philosophy in a systematic and organised approach -- this volume draws together primary texts with a minimum of commentary. The authors state there is 'no royal road' to philosophy -- that it is difficult reading, and primary texts in the field are often daunting. Where does one begin with the body of work by Plato or Aristotle, Aquinas or Hobbes?The selections in this book average 15 pages or so; the shorter among them (such as St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God) can be but a few pages, while the longer pieces include Berkeley's discourse on the difference between things and ideas, Mill's discussion of free will, and Kierkegaard's piece on despair. Even the untutored in philosophy will recognise many names -- Plato and Aristotle are included several times; other names such as Anselm, Aquinas, Descartes, Hume, Bacon, and Hobbes are joined by less well-known but important philosophers such as G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Schopenhauer, and Ryle. There are 34 selections in all, grouped under two broad categories: Philosophic Criticism, Definition and Analysis; and the Development of Philosophic Perspective.A primary purpose of this book, apart from providing source readings for the companion volume, is to stimulate the reader to further investigations. The passages are relatively short so that they are more easily digestable; each of the sections contains reference material so that students may engage the full texts at their leisure.One gets a good sense of the diversity of ideas and thinkers from collections such as these; this one is particularly good at drawing together reading that emphasise both the ideas in philosophy as well as the method of philosophical thought."},{"Title":"Aruba Laminated Map by Borch","review":"Map was good to get us going in the general right direction.

By now, the topic has covered ad nauseum and books of the sort are left (often with good reason) sitting in the corner or propping up an old table. What differentiates this from those though is that it was written in 1959 when space travel was still a passing dream to most and, as those who have read John Wyndham before will know, the author makes a perfect mix of fact, fiction and philosophy backed by genuinely good story telling to get his point across.The characters of the novel are very well conceived and all too realistic in their reactions to the circumstances presented to them. I find that John Wyndham has a talent for portraying his characters believably and accurately, which lends his far-out stories an air of realism that many authors lack. In one particular scene of Mars, the third part of the novel, one of two men stranded in a craft on Mars believes the other to be an alien in the man's body; positively bereft of reality, his calm insanity becomes absolutely chilling to one reading in the quiet of the night.Writing The Outward Urge presented serious obstacles to the author due to the technical nature of writing such a story, solved by consulting Lucas Parkes for the technological details to make it all more believable. Considering the erratic leaps and bounds technology has made since 1959, many predictions weren't so far off- such as the prediction of a space station by 1994 or the use of \\"narrow radar beams\\" used for tracking distances (think lasers).Most important however are the author's suggestions about the other aspects of space travel. While loosely connected, each story part brings its own unique interpretation and representations of the political, social and individual implications of space travel to the tale, with a very clear voice about where the he stands on each. Here too his predictions are eerily accurate. In the fourth part, Venus, he tells of the modern superpower, Brazil, claiming Space as its province, illustrating the absurdity of man's claim to territory. In the first part, The Space Station, man's desire to reach the stars is overshadowed by his government's desire to exploit its tactical possibilities (think STARWARS program) and futher its position in the global rankings. This theme of Government Agenda versus Man carries on throughout and what often begins in personal or technological triumph ends in aggressive positioning and political wrangling, robbing the moment of any victory. Pervasive in each also though is that glimmering possibility that Man will one day overcome his political chains.As with most of John Wyndham's other novels, The Outward Urge is nothing mind-blowing or particularly overwhelming, but it is a good story and very well written. What he lacks in explosive impact he exceeds in the art of subtlety and intelligence. The book can be read with ease in a day or two and, if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself itching for more and checking out the rest of his works for appeasement.

The idea of Brazil and Australia becoming super powers is interesting, so too the fact that Space exploration has only been motivated due to war and the quest for power. I sometimes wonder whether Wyndham was not confident in taking full credit for this book as it deviates from his usual British flavoured \\"cosy catastrophes\\" as such hid behind collaboration, nonetheless he should have been proud of his effort."},{"Title":"The Outward Urge","review":"In \\"The Outward Urge\\" (1959) John Wyndham writes, along with his alter ego Lucas Parkes, a story describing four generations of a British, space-faring family - the Troons. The title of the book refers to a compulsion felt by this family to leave Earth and head for the stars. In their eyes there is a destiny to be fulfilled: to spread out and conquer ever-widening reaches of space.The first chapter takes place in 1994, when the first space station is being built and mankind is yet to claim the Moon. (Wyndham never dreamed there would be footprints on the Moon just four months after his death.) The rivalry between the United States and the Soviets is intense. Britain is somewhat neutral. Ticker Troon, 24, is taking part in the construction of the space station when the project is almost sabotaged by an unknown, wandering missile. Ticker's bravery saves the lives of his fellows and the project but he never sees his new-born son Michael...Fifty years later Michael Troon is the commander of a British station on the Moon. On Earth the northern hemisphere is being pounded in a nuclear bombardment. The extent of the damage can only be guessed at but casualties are known to be in the millions. Shocking statistics for a war that has only been going for ten days. Much of the northern hemisphere is reduced to ash.After the Great Northern War countries of importance are now in the southern hemisphere. The strongest of these is Brazil. In 2094 Geoffery Trunho, the first man on Mars, becomes stranded after a misadventure with the landing module. He writes an account of what happened, in the hope that someone will find it one day. From his description, Mars is a dreary, desolate place to be marooned.By 2144, Australians have landed on Venus. (One of the Troons became an Australian citizen.) This causes something of an uproar among the Brazilians, who consider space to be their province. It looks as if their monopoly of space is being challenged and plans are made to save face. Will Australia and Brazil come to blows?At the time \\"The Outward Urge\\" was written space travel was still a dream. The best views of space were in the paintings of Chesley Bonestell, even though they were fanciful. Lucas Parkes wrote the parts of the story detailing the science (such as it was then), in an effort to make the book more believable. In the end you can't help but agree with the Troons - space needs to be colonized, and soon. In the event of an apocalyptic meteor smashing into the Earth it would be comforting to know that other planets are populated. The human race needn't become extinct."},{"Title":"But Still, Like Air, I'll Rise: New Asian American Plays (Asian American History & Cultu)","review":"BUT STILL, LIKE AIR, I'LL RISE is a delicious anthology that celebrates refreshingly original voices that frequently go unheard, unseen and unnoticed.

The book takes place in B.C. 54. It's about Mandorix, an Aeduan, whose parents were killed, and his brother ans sister killed or enslaved. He joins Caesar's army and rises through the ranks gaining respect and the friendship of the lowest decurion to even the great Caesar. There are some great battle narrations, diagrams of roman bases, and tons of latin words and phrases. Have a good time reading it!"},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"My father and uncle had this book when they were children, and my father gave it to me when I was in junior high school. It tells the story of a young man whose family was killed by bandits and is left alone in the world. He joins the Roman Legion, serves under Julius Caesar, and has exciting adventures. I reread it many, many times. In the story, virtue (including courage, industriousness, and resourcefulness) is rewarded, which gives it an uplifting message. I recommend the book highly: not only does it have a good story, but the author had researched the ancient Romans extensively and it goes a wonderful job of presenting history and Roman life in a palatable fashion.Fortunately, this is but one book of a series! (The series is called Roman Life and Times, and some of the other books have been reissued-I believe &quot;Swords in the North&quot; is now available in paperback.)"},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"My mother gave my my copy of this book when I was about [...]. I thought it was really cool because my grandfather wrote it -- no kidding, I really am Paul L. Anderson's grandson.Then I read it, and I discovered just what a wonderful story it is. Mandorix is a credible hero, and as the first-person narrator he weaves a tale at once compelling and educational. Along with the companion volumes in Anderson's Roman Life and Times series, this book motivated me to study Latin, a pursuit I still enjoy some 50 years after I first read of Gaius Iulius Caesar and Dumnorix, of Quintus Rufus and Carnifex, of the foppish Quintus Cicero and his magnificent stand against Ambiorix.Hmm, I think it's probably about time for me to read it again. If you haven't yet read it, you could order it today and be reading it by this time next week."},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"Actually my brother has this book and I read it for the first time about 10 years ago - I've read it twice more since then. Anyway, about the book I thought it was brilliant. It captivated me the moment I picked it up detailing the way it might have been as a young, up and coming soldier in the Roman Legions. It drew me in from the first page - I could not put it down easily. I was there when the main character was playing dice in the camp, I was behind him in the battles. Simply amazing."},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"\\"With the Eagles\\", by Anderson is and, has been one of the best books that ever slid its way of the printing presses and into the public. This is the story of a young Gaul (Mandorix), who finds himself left homeless due the treacherous murder of his family.With no homestead left, he decides to join Caesar's legions and within a short period of time, becomes a 1st Centurion with many a great battle tale to share with the reader.I was first introduced to this book by my high school Latin teacher in about 1963. Although I eventually failed the class, much of the \\"Omni Gauli dividindes tress partes\\" and other Latin phrases seemed to ferment in my memory banks. However, I never...never, forgot... \\"With the Eagles.\\" It initially, took me about twenty years to locate a copy of it long before the advent of the internet. In fact, I try to read this book once each year.\\"With the Eagles\\" is truly a classic! It should have been listed as such long ago with other great titles like; \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Three Years Before the Mast,\\" and others.If, you like good story telling, history, and sometimes feel the need to \\"march off\\" away from it all...you must read....\\"WITH THE EAGLES!\\""},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"since no one else in the world has read this book, and no one will ever see this page, I will tell you that this was a good book about life in a Roman army through the eyes of a soldier."},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"An amazing book! My father gave it to me, since he had read it as a boy. Knowing Roman history makes it all the better, although I imagine it would still be good without. Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"Paul L. Anderson's \\"With the Eagles,\\" appears to be the first book published in his marvelous \\"Roman Life and Times Series.\\"The book inserts a fictional character, a young Gaul named Mandorix, into many of the true events depicted in Julius Caesar's \\"The Gallic Wars: Julius Caesar's Account of the Roman Conquest of Gaul.\\" As in most of Anderson's books, the hero tells his tale in first person.As the story opens, a young Gaul named Mandorix is beset with tragedy and decides to follow in is father's footsteps by joining Caesars legions. Mandorix' adventure starts from the first page and doesn't let up until the story ends. The young warrior encounters many physical and moral trials as he distinguishes himself in battle and advances through the ranks because of his heroism, audacity, and gift for strategy.As winter falls, the legions are short of grain and the subject tribes are restless. Caesar divides his camps and grain stores across Gaul in order to conserve resources and quell any attempts at rebellion. But dividing his forces leaves him open to attack.In 54BC, on the Belgian frontier, a clever, double-crossing chieftain named Ambiorix wiped out a legion and united local tribes to lay siege to another legion camp. Rebellion is in the air and the normally independent tribes are beginning to see the benefits of working together. The situation is grim and messengers seeking help from Caesar are unable to get through the enemy territory. Mandorix volunteers to don native garb and undertake the dangerous mission.The period covered in this story precedes the famous rebellion led by Vercingetorix by two years. (I believe the Gaulish uprising is covered in Anderson's next book, \\"For Freedom and for Gaul\\".\\"). This is a very pivotal time for Rome and the events in Gaul provide Gaius Juluis Caesar with the power and impetus to become emperor.As always, Anderson's writing is elegant and his sense of time and place is gripping. The battle scenes are riveting and Mandorix is both clever and compelling as a narrator.On its own or as a companion piece to \\"The Conquest of Gaul,\\" this novel is a great read."},{"Title":"With the Eagles (His Roman life and times series)","review":"I read this years ago when I was in Junior High.

I especially recommend my friend Jack Gill's chapter on Napoleon's German allies in Spain. Fletcher includes a bibliographic essay on Wellington's army as well as a nicely updated Peninsular bibliography. A handy little volume that should find its way into all Peninsular aficinado's libraries."},{"Title":"Peninsula War; Aspects of the Struggle for the Iberian Peninsula","review":"This volume contains eleven essays by some well-known commentators on the Peninsular War, including Ian Fletcher (who edited the whole), David Chandler, Philip Haythornwaite, Paddy Griffith, Charles Esdaile, and others. The occasion for the compilation was the 190th anniversary of one starting date of the Peninsular War in 1808.The essays are of uneven but generally solid quality. A highlight is Haythorwaite's \\"That Unlucky War\\", which provides a perspective on the French experience, especially in Spain. The French invasion and their heavy-handed occupation drew bloody retaliation from the Spanish population, to the extent that by 1813, battalion and squadron-sized formations were required to escort French messengers. David Chandler's survey on sieges explains the specialized nomenclature of fortresses and siege warfare, and chronicles the major sieges of the war. Esdaile's commentary on judging the true value of the guerilla war to the defeat of the French Armies is an update and defense of an earlier article in another publication. Esdaile asserts that the Spanish guerillas may have hampered the liberation of Spain as much as helped it, by drawing off manpower from the Spanish Army. In addition, he charges that too many of the guerilla groups were no better than bandits. He acknowledges their value in pinning down large numbers of French troops for occupation duty but points out that the guerillas liberated very little Spanish territory.Other topics include short essays on fraternization between the British and French Armies, the handling of prisoners of war, and the rebirth of the Portuguese Army under British training and leadership.This volume will be of some interest to dedicated students of the Peninsular War in particular and of the Napoleonic Wars in general. The essays cover aspects of the struggle not given much coverage in other works."},{"Title":"Father Gilbert Mysteries (Radio Theatre)","review":"'Father Gilbert Mysteries' is a three episode collection of newly-produced British radio dramas. The main focus of the series is to provide an entertainment outlet for religious expression. The show is produced by a company called 'Focus on the Family Radio Theatre', whose main goal is to showcase interesting tales with a religious message. The 'Father Gilbert Mysteries' does so. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.I am a huge fan of radio productions (both old and new), and so when I saw this new set of mysteries at the local bookstore, and read the teaser on the back, I just had to give it a whirl. Though it has its faults, it *did* leave me wanting more - surely the sign of a good production?The genesis of the series is that Father Gilbert was once a detective for New Scotland Yard, but a particularly vile case made him reconsider things, and so he became a priest. He now resides in a cozy little English village, but trouble still seems to have no problem finding him. I will give a brief synopsis of each episode, giving you a better idea of what to expect of the series. But, be quite aware that this is a program steeped in Christian ethics, so keep that in mind. It is handled well for the most part, though it sometimes hinders the storyline.The first episode is: 'A Soul In Torment'. A young man comes to see Father Gilbert as the priest is moving in to his new vicarage. It comes across as though the man has commited murder (or will do so in the near future). The curious priest calls upon his policeman friend to help unravel the strange situation surrounding the mysterious visitor, and the game is afoot, so to speak. This is the weakest story, as the religious aspect isn't handled well, and causes the mystery to not really be a mystery (if that makes any sense).Program two is called: 'Where the Heart Is', and is the most solid of the lot. It involves a missing chalice that is supposedly housed on the church property where Father Gilbert resides, and the nefarious people who will do anything to get it. The story is plotted well, and some of the scenes (especially those which take place in a crypt), are pretty suspenseful.The final show is: 'Dead Air'. It explains a lot about why Father Gilbert left the police force, as the villian from the vile crime which made him resign returns to wreak more havoc. We only hear the villian over the phone, and he calls himself &quot;Legion&quot;, after a demon in the Bible. His voice is eerie, and it is in *this* story that the religious overtones really help make the story frightening (in a good way). The ending is especially scary, as Gilbert must finally confront Legion, and we are left wondering *what* the villian really was.As with most British radio programs, the production is top-notch, with great acting, well-done sound effects, and (mostly good) stories. If you can make it past the mess of 'A Soul In Torment', then you'll see what an intriguing series this really is. Christianity and mysteries are no strangers to one another, and one must admire 'Father Gilbert Mysteries' for striving to blend the two in the most pleasant way possible."},{"Title":"Father Gilbert Mysteries (Radio Theatre)","review":"My only problem with the Father Gilbert Mysteries is that there aren't more of them. I own this set on CD and think they are wonderful. The stories are involving and the characters solidly done with nice little touches throughout. My personal favorite of the three stories on this CD is Where the Heart Is followed closely by Dead Air. The stories are first rate but not particularly suspenseful or scary for that matter but they are extremely well done. The only exception might be Dead Air which did give me a little shiver when I first heard it and has my eleven year old completely terrorized (in that shivery way kids enjoy) The stories are remarkably clean and appropriate for the entire family (again Dead Air is probably not for children younger than 10) I just wish Focus on the Family would put out more of the Father Gilbert Mysteries!"},{"Title":"Father Gilbert Mysteries (Radio Theatre)","review":"This is the best audio in dramatized formed I have heard. Of course, the themes are religious, but anyone can benefit from them. The quality of the production is incredible.

I really regret the way I ended things, but if you're points are valid, sometimes things don't work out. I have since tried to make peace and that's the only real thing you can do in the end. If you are truly meant to have a relationship with someone you will, but the memories of all the fun times and times with their families who in many ways are like your own come back to haunt you many times in a bittersweet way. I'm so glad I know I'm not alone now."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"Eh, it was ok.It's a great topic but I didn't like the way it was done. Even though some of the stories were gripping in their sadness or inevitability, I agree with the reviewer who found the stories largely elitist.My principal complaint, though, is with the sameness of the writing. I felt like I was reading the same contributor again and again--checking the author bios, they are all professional writers, which assures a quality of narrative but also makes the stories strangely \\"of a kind.\\" (In this way, the also-introspective \\"Chicken Soup\\" books are superior; no matter what the topic a variety of lifestyles--a variety of \\"voices\\"--is represented.)

The essays are very well written and thoughtful; however, my criticism is that many of them are depressing. Having a friend who is not around anymore does not necessarily have to be so negative.

Perhaps because of the short story approach, I didn't really get a good sense of why these women were friends to begin with and also, not much of a sense of loss when the friendships ended. I did finish the book for my bookclub and it will lead to very good discussion on what is friendship, and our personal experiences of losing friends (or being lost as a friend). Other than that, wouldn't really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"I really had very high expectations for this book. I don't think I was able to really relate to many of these stories. I think many of the writers were trying too hard to make very prophetic statements and/or show off their writing abilities instead of keeping to a story and just trying to relate to the audience. Very few stories actually describe the friendship and how that friendship (or the end of it) affected their lives and instead focus on what events they were personally going through (which is definitely important but not the reason for the friendship's demise). After recently losing a very close friend of mine, I felt that maybe this book could help me by providing some comfort with similar experiences but instead the stories had no affect on me whatsoever. I didn't sense any GREAT sadness or loss felt by any of the authors."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"The stories included were very different from I had thought and what I had assumed from reading reviews and inside flap of the book.

It's amazing how even the closest friendship can disintigrate, as the result of a fight, a man, or just normal everyday life circumstances.Anyone who has had a similar experience, will be able to relate to these women & find their stories moving."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"The relationship between two women best friends is different than the friendship between two men can ever be. As a man, it is impossible for me to every understand the female friendship, it is simply twoo alien.It seems that the two women share a part of their life in a way men simply do not. There seem to be few, if any, secrets (men don't tell each other much of anything). There seems to be an emotional bonding that men never reach, perhaps this is part of the female carrying the emotional content of a family.I read this book then from a standpoint different than the female reader. I was wondering if the stories of friendships breaking up would provide any enlightenment. I must say that they did not. Perhaps mens lives are just easier. If there is someone you decide that you miss you call then and say \\"how about a beer.\\"I did find the book to be most interesting as an insight into the depth of feelings that women have regarding friends. This book should be a starting point for a whole bunch of Ph.D. theses on using this as a way to better explain certain thought patterns."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"\\"The Friend That Got Away\\" is a very good, if slightly uneven, anthology about women's friendships, specifically friendships that fall apart. Several of the authors were familiar to me before I read it, others I had never heard of. As with a lot of anthologies, I found that some stories worked better than others. All are revealing in ways that give the book a page-turning quality.My favorite of the group was Emily White's \\"Shelter\\" about a male-female high school friendship that goes horribly awry when the two move to New York together. The characters were vivid and fascinating; at times I had to remind myself that I wasn't reading fiction. Another standout is Nuar Alsadir's \\"Want\\". It is by far the most subjective and judgmental piece -- I would be very curious to hear the other side of that story. But it is also the piece that is best at showing rather than telling. The two sided \\"Emily/Heather\\" essay -- two friends writing both sides of the friendship -- shows just how differently people see each other, and how often people overlook their own frailities while being tough on others.There are other essays that aren't nearly as riveting but all serve to show the complexity and diversity in women's friendship. Although it may be difficult to glean any wisdom from these stories, it will make anyone who has ever lost a friend realize they are not alone."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"For a long while I went in circles over the \\"mystery\\" of my lost friendships and wondered how other people managed with hardly a bump in the road...and then this book found it's way into my life. The stories are so heartfelt that at points I had to wait days to read another one. It's a well thought out collection and one that will stand the test of time for all friendships long term or just made. Ann Hood's selection is one that I won't soon forget. Thank You to all of these writers for putting into words how it truely is,no matter how hard that may be."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"After reading the essays in the poignant, affecting anthology, The Friend Who Got Away: 20 Writers Tell the True Stories behind Their Blow-Ups, Burnouts, and Slow Fades (edited by Jenny Offill & Elissa Schappell), it got me to thinking about girlfriends - how we form intense, fierce attachments because we expect friendships to be lasting, our bonds tight, unyielding - so it's that much more devastating when a friend's love flickers and fades and the breakup could be far more damaging and agonizing than a relationship with a lover. It's true we don't talk about our friend break-ups like we dissect and overanalyze our relationships with significant others. Typically, when I'm asked about someone who's no longer in my life, I say that we had a \\"falling out\\", that it's \\"complicated\\" - what the editors echo in their foreword. In her introduction, Francine Prose remarks: A number of these pieces deal with the ways we form youthful friendships at a time when we ourselves are only partly formed, and still see our friends as mirrors in which we desperately hope to glimpse a sharper and clearer, or simply more interesting image of ourselves. From twenty finely assembled writers, we learn motley tales: from devastating falling-outs to the subtle shifts and mistakes that could dissolve a life-long friendship. Friendships splintered by racism, envy, varying political beliefs, death, and the sheer reality of growing apart.In Helen Schulman's heartbreaking \\"First in Her Class\\", teacher/student barriers dissolve when an unlikely, but passionate friendship is struck between a new creative writing professor and her twenty-five year old student, Leigh, who had that \\"fresh earnest American prettiness\\", but would die before her twenty-eighth birthday of cancer. Leigh is resilient, ferociously independent, striving to bear her sickness alone, without the help of her family until the very end. Time lived becomes extraordinarily precious as the two form an intense union, frenetically discussing writing, art and private personal tragedies. Ultimately, we discover how death undoes the bonds of that friendship and leads to betrayal.Envy pervades a disquieting relationship between two twenty-something's in Nuar Alsadir's \\"Want\\" A once attention-grabbing, capricious, Ava soon reveals a more complicated, sinister agenda - coveting everything in her best friend's life, from shoes to boyfriends to a red leather jacket, Ava is likened to Tom Ripley (The Talented Mr. Ripley). Alsadir artfully navigates identity constructs, revealing through a perfectly paced narrative, how imitation (which contrary to popular belief isn't always the sincerest form of flattery) and want (defined as to desire, and to lack), can severely ruin a friendship.What are the limits of a friendship? How far can one tread on that precarious balance beam of utter betrayal and a fleeting infidelity? Kate Rophie's \\"Torch Song\\" scrutinizes that sudden physical impulse in an age when people didn't belong as absolutely to other people...There was a kind of fluidity to our world. Two outsiders cling together in an exclusive Portland prep school, vehemently plotting their escape to New York, a city which has become a \\"kind of Jerusalem\\", but uncover how quickly their friendship withers upon their arrival in the big city in Emily White's standout, \\"Shelter\\". Immersed in the ecstasy, gay-clubbing frenzy of Chelsea, Raymond discovers a world of beautiful gay boys loud and proud, and suddenly his best friend Emily has lost her luster, perhaps serving as a constant reminder of the broken home left behind, while Emily spends her time with a forty-three-year-old failed writer who talks big but amounts to very little. White depicts the painful progression of her loss, how she found herself ostracized and even ridiculed by her once closest ally, who is more than happy to lose himself in this new lifestyle.Many of the stories in the anthology detail how death and severe illness could also serve as the grim reaper of a friendship - ushering in those uncomfortable silences, awkward condolences and relationships that simply cannot survive these searing tragedies. Fast, furious friends as Swarthmore freshman, writers Emily Chenoweth \\"Heather\\" and Heather Abel \\"Emily\\", orbited around each other, they were \\"two girls dancing and singing and drawing and learning Foucault and talking about boys, in code, all inside a soap bubble. In striking companion stories, we capture a rare and honest glimpse of how a mother's death dramatically alters their carefree world, rendering them vulnerable, hurt and angry. With death comes grief, and the necessity of affection, sympathy and companionship - all the markers of a good friendship - multiples, and the demand for these things, while two women are forging their identities, can be all-consuming and exhaustive. The companion pieces are a heartfelt call and response to one another, a painful duet of regret. In the end, Chenoweth writes, my love for Heather was a piece of glass in my heart, it hurt every time I moved.The stories within The Friend Who Got Away: 20 Writers Tell the True Stories behind Their Blow-Ups, Burnouts, and Slow Fades eschew all the stereotypes of catty, battling gals, yet the tales told never border on sentimental, instead they stew in that dark, middle place where former friends quietly ghost and women courageously try to reconcile their losses."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"If \\"platonic divorce\\" isn't already a term, it certainly should be.I bought this book in 2007 for my best friend of nearly 20 years, having read it myself while she & I were going through a tough time in our lives and in our friendship. Unfortunately, I never had a chance to find out what she got out of the book - we severed ties permanently not long after - but for my part I can say that Offill and Schappell have put together a great collection. Each essay outlines a different woman's story, and lets us look into what led to the demise of their most cherished friendship; the reasons and circumstances are many and differing, often as complex as the relationship between best friends, and the stories chosen to be part of this book are varied enough that any of us who've ended a close friendship for any reason - moving away, getting married, money issues, being at different points in your lives, being betrayed (or the betrayer), and more - will be able to relate to something in them.I've found that the pain of saying goodbye to your longtime best friend, confidante and partner in crime is different but just as deep as - some would say deeper than - getting a divorce. For some reason, though, it's not recognized as such in society; we accept the devastation of a marriage ending, but are too quick to wave away the very real and very deep pain associated with losing a close friend, who has oftentimes been in one's life longer than any husband or boyfriend. There is woefully little on the bookshelves to help us get through the confusion and loneliness that follows the loss of your \\"platonic soul mate,\\" but \\"The Friend Who Got Away\\" makes up for that in spades. If you've experienced a falling out with your BFF, or feel as though your friendship might be heading into troubled waters, pick up this book. The 20 stories between the covers will reassure you that you're not alone in your sadness."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"This book jumped out at me at the book store because I have my own friendship lost stories and was intrigued by such an anthology. Initially, I was looking for a book that might answer questions about my own losses, but instead, I found a richly written group of stories that were each as unique as my own lost friendship stories.As I read, I realized that I didn't need the stories to answer my questions. They served to make me feel that my own stories were not unique. Friendship and loss are universal experiences.Sometimes with an anthology I will read one story and then have to put the book down. With this book, I looked forward to the next story right away and couldn't put the book down until I had finished them all.I totally enjoyed the reading experience. The writing was very high calibre, and the experiences and points of view were profound and thoughtful.

In my lifetime, I have experienced the end of many relationships, some for expediency, others because paths diverged, and some, even for the best. Yet I will never forget this special women and all the wonderful conversations, thoughts and dreams we once shared - and now do not. Those who believe, in general, that romantic relationships are more intense than platonic friendships are in for a surprise. As I read the twenty essays included in this gem of a collection, some of them wonderful, others not, I was amazed at how many resonated with me and reminded me of various and diverse relationships I have had with women over the years. I was struck by the complexity of these friendships, and the variety of reasons they ended.One friendship broke-up over a loan. Another, because men, sex and dates took priority over women friends. Others ended because of intellectual differences, competition, ambition, and betrayal. A few stories are devastating in nature, one involves the loss of a child. Authors Heather Abel and Emily Chenoweth discuss their mutual college friendship, and its demise, in separate essays. \\"I've never had a friendship that was that intense,\\" Chenoweth said in a recent interview. \\"It did make it volatile in the way that a love relationship can be. But the thing is, lovers have a vocabulary for talking about the relationship. I'm not sure that exists for friends.\\" Now, at age 33, both have reconciled.Contributors Heather Abel, Diana Abu Jaber, Dorothy Allison, Nuar Alsadir, Kate Bernheimer, Emily Chenoweth, Jennifer Gilmore, Beverly Gologorsky, Vivian Gornick, Ann Hood, Nicole Keeter, Patricia Marx, Lydia Millet, Mary Morris, Francine Prose, Katie Roiphe, Helen Schulman, Elizabeth Strout, Emily White, share their well written, unique stories with the reader, which will inevitably evoke a multitude of feelings.

While it's not at all surprising to hear of love lost, it is somehow startling and fascinating when friendship ends. That person who knew you like no other, to whom you confided all your dreams and secrets, is no longer in your life --- leaving an enormous and sometimes heartbreaking gap.In this nonfiction anthology of essays, twenty well-known female writers tell their true tales of friendship lost. Two authors, once best friends, share separate perspectives of their parting.I was delighted to discover names of authors I admire, including Ann Hood, whose \\"How I Lost Her\\" made me weep. Other standouts include the horribly disturbing \\"Flawless\\" by Lydia Millet (I'm not sure I can say I enjoyed it, but I'll be thinking about it for a very long time). \\"Want\\" by Nuar Alsadir, describing a friend who takes imitation to a distressing level, also intrigued and bothered me. The black-humored \\"Tenure\\" by Patricia Marx, in which the author wryly describes herself as \\"the most easygoing, accommodating, nonjudgmental, and unassuming friend in the world\\" was the one tale that made me laugh ruefully.Curiously, Diana Abu-Jaber's \\"In-Betweens,\\" telling of the author's childhood relationship with two boys, is the only story in the anthology describing a lost friendship with a male. I can't help but wonder why that is, and if it's representative.The theme of friendship won and lost is universal and riveting; each story in this collection is sincere and regretful. Several tales struck a chord, reminding me of my own lost friends. Others fascinated me by telling of friendships unlike any I've encountered. However, as much as I enjoyed THE FRIEND WHO GOT AWAY, I couldn't help but notice that tale after tale of loss can make for a downbeat reading experience. Despite that minor quibble (easily solved by interspersing these stories with other, lighter reading), I definitely recommend this thought-provoking and intriguing anthology.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon"},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"This book explains that loosing friends is a natural but painful part of a woman's life. Because I had inadvertently assumed myself and other people who did this somehow 'failed' at having friends, this book provided critical reassurance.The end to a friendship can come suddenly, as in the result of a heated argument, or it can develop over time, like high school friends who move away from their hometown to attend college or school friends who move apart and 'forget' to write to each other. Even if nothing intentionally provokes the development, some things just cannot be sustained indefinitely. Letting go of a friendship which drifts away is much healthier than attempting to sustain it for appearances sake.Because I have had several friendships end in my own lifetime, I appreciated the frank monologues inside this book. There was not anything which we could have done to save the friendship and a friendship's end does not mean that either one of us were bad people to another. It's just something that happens throughout life.I sporadically still think about many of my former friends, and wonder if they also remember the good times which we had shared at a mutual point in our lives. However, I also recognize that because we are presently in different places-- both geographically and mentally--our friendship would not necessarily rekindle itself were we to again meet up. Even assuming that we would be able to work everything out, we would then have to start the relationship over.I usually do not like self-help or advice books, but this book avoids nagging in favor of real answers to common problems. Plus, it does not blame the women whose friendships end."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"I wonder often if the authors of books like these realize at all how few people really live the lives they are writing about. By this I mean lives of art show openings, long intellectual conversations, shopping at small trendy boutiques for interesting clothes, traveling the world and having moments of revelations while watching exotic sunsets...I am not saying all these times are literally included here, but you get the picture! Most of the essays here seem much more written to show off the authors' Writer's Workshop prose than to really talk about lost friendships. I was eager to read this book as it's a big issue in many women's lives---friendship is such a vital part of our lives and lost friendships can be much like divorces, yet it's not often written about. A few of the essays did not disappoint, most notably the one by Ann Hood. I had thought of her so often since reading in the paper about the tragic loss of her daughter, and her lost friendship in the aftermath of that tragedy is so affecting to read about. A few other essays were wonderful, mainly the ones written about childhood friendships, such as the one by Nicole Keeter. But almost all the rest were nothing that I could relate to at all. I think the editors could have looked for a little more divesity---do no blue collar women lose friends? Do very few women with children lose friends? Do those in rural areas lose friends? Do those who, heaven forbid, write with styles not honed in writers workshops lose friends?Overall, a good idea marred by the choices of essays and authors."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"Twenty women share their personal accounts of friendships that ended, sometimes by choice, other times by distance, death, money or men. There are stories of regret and others of relief. Most interestingly, two writers who used to be best friends each detail the beginning and demise of their relationship from their own perspectives (\\"Emily\\", by Heather Abel, and \\"Heather\\", by Emily Chenoweth). There isn't a woman alive (or man, for that matter) who hasn't been in the same situation; for whatever reason, a friendship ends. In our society, which is usually exclusively concerned with the drama and importance of romantic and familial relationships, we don't give much thought to the weight of platonic friendships and there are no easy rules or platitudes upon which to base one's behavior or draw boundaries. The confusion and ambiguity that envelops such relationships is captured perfectly in the pages of this book. While it may be difficult to relate to the life circumstances of all the authors (most are upper-middle class white women with Ivy League educations), the emotions that arise from the death of their friendships are not. Only a few essays contained viewpoints with which I had difficulty empathizing. Overall, this book tackles a subject that is universal but is usually relegated to the backs of our minds, not widely discussed. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"I read this book as a comfort. To realize that others have gone through this too. Having a friend that knows everything about you, helps you make life changing decisions, lends a hand as you climb out of situations, grieves with you, smile and laughs with you - those are the friends that make your life content. It is always nice to share all the little tidbits of your day, your thoughts with someone who won't judge you, someone who encourages you, someone who knows you when the barriers come down. Friends can be so amazing but once someone is that close - sometimes you find yourself at a stage where you just can't be their everything. And they can't be everything you want/need. As your life grows, it alters your personality and responsibilities, your priorities and your time gets divided into smaller available sections. If the friendship isn't flexible enough to reinvents itself through those changing times - it can break. Losing a friend that is that close is really like losing a part of you. They were your conscience, they were your diary - your sounding board. You confided in them a variety of topics probably more than anyone else. When they are gone - a part of you is lost. I was hoping this book would help me figure out a way to either find myself again - or to maybe shed some light on how I might possibily rebuild my fractured friendship."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"I picked up this book because of the intriguing title and cover. As a close observer of adolescent girls and their friendships, the stories of adult women and the \\"what happens after\\" drew me in. I also wondered if the friendships discussed were fractured by the same relationally aggressive behaviors I see regularly in teens. Not much had changed. Jealousy, exclusion, gossip, and, in paricular, competition over a man (who goes blameless) seems capable of driving a wedge between women across the decades. Still, the sense of sad longing for something treasured and lost renews my belief that making a friendship work is worth it."},{"Title":"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away","review":"My book club just read this anthology and it was a huge hit, one of the few books we've read that everyone liked.

I loved the fact that the essays covered a wide range of issues between friends (death, marriage, divorce, money, distance, careers etc.) and representative of various life stages in women's lives (school-aged, teenagers, young adults, 20-something, 30-something and beyond).

The intent of the 'The Founders' is to condense that series into a single volume. While I am sympathetic to this goal, it seems that perhaps it was the publisher's idea rather than the author's; I can't help but feel that the author's heart just wasn't in it. It reads very much like a cut-and-paste job from his earlier books. Choppy in parts and lacking in the specific hypotheses that make for interesting historical reading, the section on Rome, in particular, lacks style. Augustus is dealt with fairly well, but most of the Emperors are dealt with in an almost Old Testament-like manner: so-and-so begat so-and-so who begat so-and-so who begat.... The author would have been better off inserting a few original ideas into this section and skipping the long and pointless recitation of the succession of later Emperors.The Greek section is organized by geography. I did extract some enjoyment from this treatment. By organizing the text in this way, the author has avoided the usual near-exclusive focus on Athens and Sparta that characterizes many popular treatments of ancient Greece. However, like the Roman section, this focus on geography leads to a certain amount of choppiness as the author skips from one city state to the next, and a consequent feeling of disjointedness that stylistically belies the author's stated purpose of conceptually unifying the Greco-Roman world.In praise of the book, I will say that I appreciate the back matter. The author provides references to original Greek and Roman sources for many of the most significant statements in the book, a table of dates comparing contemporary Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and American events, as well as a decent set of maps of the ancient world - a feature lacking in so many popular history books.In closing, I would say that abridgement is an underappreciated art. D.M. Low's abridgement of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a good example of abridgement by a significant scholar. Somervell's abridgement of Toynbee's A Study of History is another example of fine and seemless condensing. Grant, unfortunately, it seems, though a decent original writer, has little talent and less patience for the art of abridgement. Perhaps this volume should not have been attempted in the first place."},{"Title":"The Founders of The Western World","review":"If you always wanted to learn about Ancient Greece and Rome but didn't know where to start this book by Michael Grant is a good place to do it. In this small but comprehensive book, Michael Grant carefully outlines all of the historical milestones that made both civilizations great and timeless.Grant first begins with covering the Greek world and devotes 2/3 of his book to that subject. Grant covers the origins of Greek speaking peoples with groups such as the Myceneans and their contact with other Mediterranean civilizations. Grant then proceeds to Classical Greece, the Persian Wars, and the Peloponnesian War. Grant explains the origins of democracy in Athens and contrast with Sparta's dual monarchy. Grant also devotes significant attention to the political, philosophical, and artistic contributions of the Greeks. The section on Greece concludes with Alexander The Great and the Hellenic period.Grant's section on Rome is also comprehensive in covering the significant events that shaped Rome and her contributions. Grant covers the origins of Rome under the Etruscans and the Greek Italian colonies. Grant also covers the importance of the Punic Wars, Rome's contact with the Celts, and Rome's conquest of the Hellenic monarchies. Grant also discusses the impact of popular Roman leaders such as Marius, Sulla, Caesar, Pompey, Cicero, and Crassus. After explaining the Republic, Grant does a broad overview of the Principate devoting most of his attention to Augustus, Constantine, and Diocletian. As with his Greek section, Grant devotes some sections to discuss Rome's contributions in government, military, and artistic areas.This is a very good introductory text where the reader won't feel overwhelmed by strange names or concepts in their efforts to learn about ancient Greece and Rome. The book also puts those civilizations in perspective by explaining the legacy they left to the modern world in various fields such as language and culture; political science; military science; architecture; and, philosophy. I strongly recommend this book to anyone beginning to learn about Rome or who's looking for a good intorductory classroom textbook suitable for Jr. High and up."},{"Title":"The Founders of The Western World","review":"I agree with the reviewer who called it a cut and paste job, but disagree with the \\"Not bad\\" judgement.

I would recommend \\"The Teaching Company\\" lectures as a far better way to learn about early modern civilizations.

Even now, I cannot claim that this book has made me an expert, far from it, in fact. But, I have a much greater appreciation of what like was like in the Transvaal (or black locations) in South Africa. Even though the title is a work of fiction, I believe that the reader will get a much greater understanding on this topic. (And like other reviewers, I admit I picked this up because it is written by Orlando Bloom's father.I will use any excuse to pick up a new and different book! )Bloom's story is set in the fictional town of Nelstroom, S. Africa. We are introduced to two main characters, Du Toit, the location manager and Mabaso; a black man who has come from Johannesburg with the hopes of easing the hardships of life in the location. Du Toit begins his job with the best of intentions, trying to make life better while still enforcing the laws of apartheid. He will eventually, of course, give in to the higher ups. Mabaso is an educated man. He makes the people of the location aware of how they suffer. And we all know education is a powerful thing. The people who stand behind these two men will clash and begin to rebel against each other. This is a book you know will not have a happy ending from the first page.Since I can't find the words from my own experiences to describe the total unfairness and confusion of apartheid, I would like to take a quote from the book, which stuck with me from the point I read it until I finished and long after that. \\"Facts are twisted, illusions fostered, truth destroyed to prove that the perverted is normal, the sordid noble, the brutal beautiful, the guilty innocent, the coward a hero, disaster a victory-and the reverse of all these things.\\"(Pgs 277-278). Harry Bloom was imprisoned for writing this book, that alone is testament to its truth. Despite its heavy subject, it is a great, fast paced read. And a book that will stick with you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Transvaal Episode","review":"I must admit that I originally picked up this book for the curiosity factor of it having been written by actor Orlando Bloom's father. However, from the very first page the gripping tale of oppression, hopelessness, and desperation in South Africa sucked me in like few novels I can remember. The writing style was lush in its descriptive power, and the author's intimate knowledge of both the people and the problems of the region shines through page after page. Although one knows from the very first page that this tale will *not* have a happy ending, even in its horror the conclusion makes perfect sense and holds one until the very last paragraph. The one minor gripe I had with the novel was the shifting perspective and timeline; however, both were required to gain a full sense of the events and the insanity behind them. This is a serious work for the serious reader and definitely worth more than a single reading. I highly recommend this work."},{"Title":"Transvaal Episode","review":"Walter Mabaso, a black freedom fighter who comes to Nelstroom, a fictional town in Africa, and Hendrik Du Toit, the newly arrived white Manager for Nelstroom's &quot;Location,&quot; the segregated ghetto where the African population must live, are the two major characters whose psyches and lives Harry Bloom explores with the skill of a literary surgeon. They and the other characters are strikingly drawn, reminding me of the clarity of characterization in John Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH. Both novels deal with dispossesed people struggling to salvage their lives and their dignity against poverty and oppression, except in Bloom's gentle masterpiece, the oppressors are the proponents of apartheid in South Africa. Now we live in a world where Nelson Mandela has triumphed, but Bloom's story takes us to the early days of the fight for racial equality, and goes beyond it. The plot is elegantly structured to show how oppressive governments create a vicious system where the victim becomes the human fuel it runs upon, until the ruling class' blithe disregard for the human rights of the under class ignites into a storm of confrontation . . . one so volatile that no cover-up can sweep away the ashes. Add to this a use of language that is so concise, every word builds a sparse clear picture in the reader's mind and eye. Transvaal Episode won the British Authors Club Award in 1957 for best novel of the year. What amazes me is how the characters and events in this novel could be equally played out today in other countries where human right struggles are still ongoing. This novel should be required reading for anyone dealing with national and international politics and power. It teaches us to understand how easily those in power can brainwash us into believing what we think we see, when we're really seeing what they want us to, and the true picture is totally different.

Yes, there is far too much interaction with the pseudo-science of the day, but this &quot;abridgement&quot; lays waste to whole areas of interest to anyone who would want to read Hodge in the first place. It's interesting that one of the areas where the cutting is most obvious is in the area where the &quot;editor&quot; disagrees with Hodge the most, that is the locus of &quot;eschatology&quot;. The editor is a Premillennialist and Hodge, like all Princetonians was a clear Postmillennialist. If you want to read Hodge without the excess verbiage, buy A.A Hodge's &quot;Outlines of Theology&quot;, which is based on the very same lectures that Charles Hodge published as his Systematics. It's simpler, yet doesn't alter the truth the way this chopped-up mess does. This abridgement is a master maligned."},{"Title":"Systematic theology","review":"The original Hodge's theology was three large volumes, with frequent pages cited in Latin, German, Greek, and occaisional other languages. But, it was the best of American Reformed theology from the turn of the century. Edward Gross has condensed and revised this work, and made it readable (all in English). I recommend this book for any Christian interested in the deeper side of the faith, and advise also reading Basic Theology by Charles Ryrie as a balancing view."},{"Title":"Systematic theology","review":"This is the most extensive theology from the REFORMED tradition in fairly recent times. Written by Charles Hodge, a professor at Princeton in the early 1900's, it is a scholarly presentation of the historic Christian faith.

Written at a Graduate level, I do not recommend it before studying college level theology. At least read Ryrie's &quot;Basic Theology&quot; (ISBN 089693814X) first. But for a really comprehensive study, this is the book."},{"Title":"Systematic theology","review":"Hodge's work is one of the great reformed theologies ever done.

If wanted to study theology that was consistent Orthodox Presbyterian theology, consistent what was taught by the Puritans and the Westminster Confession of Faith. Hodges Systematic Theology is consistent with what Princeton University was then and no longer. Princeton fell into the suede to the popular intellectual pursuits of other theological seminaries. This work is comprehensive in presenting sound theological thought. Comparisons are made between theological thought of the Presbyterian church and Calvinism with other schools of thought in theology: Roman Catholic (called Romanist), Lutheran, liberal theology and nonChristian thought. The arguments for historic theology of the Reformed theology are sound and give a fair presentation of contrary thought.I do not think this book is a difficult read who is familiar with theological terms, but its length demands a determine reader. I read each of the three volumes at three distinct times. I read several other books before moving until I went to the next volume. Although in three volumes the book is divided into four topics: Theology Proper, Anthropology, Soteriology and Eschatology. Charles Hodge argues on page 32 Ecclesiology is included throughout the book.Theology Proper is the study of God. Hodge includes a discussion what the Bible teaches of the being of God, of the three held personality of the Godhead, or that of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are distinct in persons, same in substance, equal in power and glory, relation of God to the world, or His decrees and His works in creation and Providence.Anthropology is the study of man. Hodge includes in this discussion the origin and nature of man. In this discussion he includes Darwin's theory of Evolution and why he finds it wanting. Besides thoughts from other theologians, Hodge discusses other scientific arguments of the origin of the universe. Anthropology is not limited to the origin of man and creation. It included of man's original state before God, man's original probation, Man's fall before God, the nature of sin, effect of Adam's sin on himself and the effects of Adams sin on prosperity. Who and what is man?Soteriology is the study of Salvation. Hodge includes in this discussion God's purpose in providing salvation to man, God's plan of salvation for man, the person of Jesus, the work of Jesus, Jesus as redeemer, the application of redemption; regeneration, Justification, sanctification and means of grace.Eschatology is the study of death and final events. Hodge includes in this discussion the state of the soul after death, man's resurrection unto life or unto death, the second advent of Jesus, the general judgment of all men: (some unto salvation and others unto damnation), the end of the world, and a new Heaven and New earth.Ecclesiology is the study of the Church. That is the True church that includes all those truly saved by the Grace of God. What makes up what is taught in the Bible and what is contrary to God's Word. I repeat this book shares the views contrary to orthodox teaching of then the Presbyterian church."},{"Title":"Systematic theology","review":"Even without a table of contents, this is worth the time reading through it and studying its contents.

However, before he can accomplish his life's quest, he knows he needs employment, but depressingly has no prospects having to count pennies to buy cigarettes. When he sees the note on a convenience store bulletin board that the Green Valley Christian Church seeks a custodian, he expects rejection, but instead Pastor Jacobson hires him.The church congregation reaches out to Dylan inviting him to dinners, events, and Sunday services. Their outreach begins to provide solace to Dylan who begins to embrace Jesus though he still trips up like any human does. Though he still wants Lorraine at his side, Dylan has found comfort in the Lord. However, perhaps it is the mysterious ways, but an unconscious Dylan finally meets up with Lorraine in the hospital where she works at.The key to this inspirational second chance at redemption novel is Dylan, who over the course of the plot learns what is really THE MISSING PIECE in his life. He starts off the tale with no hope tenuously clinging to one pathetic goal. Starting with the kindness of the Pastor, over time he begins to change and modifies his goals to something much loftier though he still wants Lorraine with him and he also takes backward steps on his journey. Readers who delight in tales that focus on second chance relationships with the Lord and beloved humans will relish Carol McCormick's heartening novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Missing Piece (Inspirational Love Story)","review":"I was so caught up in this book because it was so believable.

Bravo Carol!"},{"Title":"The Missing Piece (Inspirational Love Story)","review":"The Missing Piece captivated me. As a man, it caused me to pause and take a fresh look at my own life. In the beginning, Dylan is looking for a job after misplaced priorities landed him in jail. He loves to fish and have a few (too many) drinks. He's a \\"man's man\\", so to speak, but he is someone that I (and so many men) can relate to.Dylan experiences many hardships and struggles, but with the help of a local church and his eventual faith in God, he begins to find deeper, more meaningful desires, his true passions, and the real man begins to emerge. This is a story of surrender and redemption, sin and forgiveness, passion and true love. Reading The Missing Piece was a very deep and moving experience for me. This story and mine intersect at various points with uncanny similarities. There were times while reading that all I could do was stop and reflect on my own life. Most men (myself included) have a difficult time identifying with characters in romance fiction, but this book is a rare exception. I'm sure The Missing Piece will help many find there missing piece and there missing PEACE as well.A great book for men and for couples to share.

He will read the rest on his own."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece (Inspirational Love Story)","review":"I started reading this late one day, not expecting much and not really knowing what to expect at all - the cover was sort of ambiguous. But this book kept me up in the wee hours of the morning because I had to finish it. I was very emotionally gripped by it. It was amazing how the female author had realistically, I thought, captured the voice of the male protagonist. Sometimes when a romance inspired book is written by a female the point of view still comes across too 'female'. And this is so much more than a romance. It is really drama dealing with realistic issues. I feel that the issues were resolved too quickly and so not like real life in that sense, but then again, I expect that. This is a novel and it can't go on forever. And to top it all off it was a clean read! There are so many books that I read, finish, and then just keep scrolling by on my Kindle ever after. They leave no impression, though not bad books at all.

My litmus test of a great book is one that you can't put down, and that you think about the characters as friends long after you are done. Honestly, after I finished this book, I had to work to remember the characters names.It had it's good points: the main character struggles with addiction, and the author did a good job of portraying the consequences that follow addiction. I also liked how the author realistically portrayed the fact that even after giving his life to Jesus, the character still had to battle the intense desires of the flesh. So many Christian fiction writers act as if, after the character becomes a Christian, they no longer have any troubles or temptations.The book was weak in some aspects of character development and detail. For example, our heroine obtained her nursing degree in 18 months? (Yes, I've very picky over accuracy of details). Also, at times I found the immaturity of the heroine annoying.Overall, not a bad book. It's your typical, run-of-the-mill Christian fiction.

After a brief introduction into Posture-Movement Therapy he provides a section on how your back works, the physiology of the spine, discs, joints, etc. and how this relates to your posture, movement and back problems. Bruce Kodish covers everything that you need to understand in order to safely use the techniques on yourself.For myself, I was having some problems with discomfort in my upper back and used the appropriate technique in the book. I found that I was able to completely relieve the problem. I would have liked more specific techniques and specific excercises for different situations, but then again it had all I needed to help myself so maybe it is complete.

It is good to be reminded of the need for good posture. However, little or no mention is made of special back conditions or other causes or practically applicable solutions for back pain. This book won't be of much help to someone who has any sort of special back condition, which would typically be the person who would buy such a book and take the time to read it.

A good online search would have probably provided more.Even aesthetically speaking, the text in poorly written and the diagrams are pixelated, giving out the feeling that this was a poor attempt to make a book out of notes from a seminar.I would urge you to check the book out in a bookstore, before purchasing it !As for exercising postural awareness, I would definitely recommend Eric Franklin's books."},{"Title":"SPLENDOURS AND MISERIES","review":"Received book yesterday; securely wrapped, arrived in perfect condition.

And the major character is a Christian Sheriff, having to almost hide his faith because of people's mistaken belief that Christians are not tolerant of other's.Well before it's time, it covers issues of faith, family, political corectness, and forgiveness.

Pure physiology books are usually so packed full of tiny text and incomprehensible diagrams that most people will be either beside themselves with panic or comatose after just a few pages. The authors of Essential Medical Physiology seem to have realised these facts and have produced a book which differs significantly from others in the field. The text is marginally larger than in comparable books and the chapters are thoroughly indexed and summarised. In short, the authors seem to be refreshingly in tune with the medical student's needs. Explanations are written in an almost informal manner and reach the level of complexity exactly appropriate for a medical degree. Processes students traditionally struggle with (such as the countercurrent exchange system in the nephron) are presented clearly and lucidly with extremely accessible accompanying diagrams that take you through the arguments step-by-step. Essential Medical Physiology also tackles any feelings of apathy towards the preclinical teaching by continually supplying the reader with \`Clinical Notes' which flag-up the importance of understanding the physiological mechanisms to the practise of clinical medicine. The figures are extremely clear and lucid throughout, despite being presenting in a two-tone blue and black format. Diagrams of this quality, however, require a large amount of space and areas slightly off the beaten track of core medical physiology have been cut to a minimum. The reader will find explanations of intracellular processes, such as protein synthesis, extremely brief - but it is not a medical physiology book that one would immediately turn to for this information. In summary, when lost in the jungle that is preclinical physiology, it is depressingly often that the book you turn to for guidance is not only ignorant of the direction you should take but doesn't even seem to speak your language. Essential Medical Physiology will not only point you in the right direction, it will draw you a map and advise you on the best guest houses for when you get out. It is a refreshingly clear book in both text and diagrams."},{"Title":"Essential Medical Physiology","review":"I teach renal physiology for different courses, so I will focus my opinion mostly in this area. In general this is a very good book, especially in renal,digestive and endocrine physiology.It covers from system to cell physiology whenever is possible.Althogh the section on muscle physiology needs to be improved with more information in excitation contraction coupling and smooth muscle. Clearly written and provided with good illustrations. Clinical notes provide a good nexus between normal function and pathology.Renal physiology is particulary clear in concepts and facts.However, it uses names of the nephron nomenclature, especially fron micropuncture, which are not defined in the corresponding section. Also it seems to me that the chapter of acid and base physiology needs a more detailed discussion concerning the handling of NH4+.Renal physiology is hard to learn and the section in this book is a very good help."},{"Title":"Essential Medical Physiology","review":"The number of typographical errors in this textbook is utterly astounding. This is completely unacceptable for a text that many medical students will use as gospel for physiology. In addition, much of the book goes into excruciating and unecessary detail, making it extremely slow to read. There are only a few positive things to say: (1) the renal and endocrine sections are quite good and (2) the clinical vignettes provide important information. There are far better texts available, try Guyton's &quot;Textbook of Medical Physiology,&quot; already in its ninth edition."},{"Title":"Essential Medical Physiology","review":"This textbook was our &quot;required text&quot; during first year medical school. I always assumed that bribery of some sort resulted in this situation, as I cannot find any redeeming qualities of this book except that it makes an excellent doorstop. Why is this book a waste of your time? Under the assumption that you are a medical student, let me tell you: it's way too detailed for any medical student to dream of ever learning during first year physiology. Let's face it- we have a lot to learn in an extremely short amount of time, and the time must be rationed wisely. Most students will never have the time or patience to sit and spend hours reading about the mathematics of diffusion (example). Some great, useful physiology textbooks are &quot;Principles of Physiology&quot; by Berne and Levy (the thinner paperback) and Guyton &amp; Hall as a reference book. Don't waste your time with the Johnson."},{"Title":"Essential Medical Physiology","review":"While not the avid &quot;reviewer&quot; type, I thought it necessary to warn others about this text. Purchasing this book as an &quot;optional&quot; text for my undergraduate physiology course, I expected that it would provide clear explanations of the processes being covered in lectures. I was first disappointed in flipping through to discover that the book only includes a few diagrams all of which are entirely composed of blue and or black ink. Then, hoping to find clear explanations inside the small type, journal style, marginless and endless paragraphs, I was again disappointed.Halfway through my full year course I am searching for more options as this book fails to help me in those desperate moments when lecture notes just don't seem to make sense. This book goes into lengthy detail with mediocre summaries, such that the reader gets lost in details (and the neverending sentences) long before any understanding of the topic occurs. The lack of diagrams leaves no other option other than finding another source.Any students out there?? Find another book!

Luckily, I had spent some time with Landau & Lifshitz's books so I had some foundation that was necessary to run through this book.I didn't necessarily loathe this book, but I also didn't care for it very much either. It has a strange brevity to it, almost akin to Landau's books, but unlike Landau (or should I say Lifshitz), I believe Kittel fails in effectively relaying the information to the reader. Some sections are abnormally short, whereas others are long and could have been easily referenced to other (better) texts/papers.

I have not finished it nor will I probably; I checked out some other references from the library but most other authors even use a different outline for the course so I'm forced to look back at Kittel. I am not afraid to tackle a complex subject but my experience so far with this book has been confusion and frustration: the author uses terminology without explaining it, talks about new concepts without any sort of introduction. At many points in the reading you'll find yourself wondering what is going on.My worst experience with a textbook in my entire education. There is a book by Burns that's been tremendously helpful. Ashcroft & Mermin seem adequate as well."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"I think the word which best describes the book is either dreadful or possibly horrendous.While there is no doubt Kittel does indeed know his way around the subject it would appear his long academic career has rendered him unable to teach it.

I do not believe I have ever encountered a worse book. As a student in love with math and physics with grades to match this STILL instilled a hatred for anything related to the book and the course.Professors and universities; PLEASE do NOT use this book.

Sadly, the quality of the text has deteriorated with time. The 7th edition is poorly organized, much of the new material is too sketchy to be useful and some of it is flat wrong. References were made to works of various individuals but the actual publications were not cited so it was difficult to locate the original papers.Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a really good beginning level solid state text available. Aschcroft &amp; Mermin is a little too advanced and has not been revised since the 70's, although I did find myself referring to it frequently to clarify some of the muddle in Kittel's book. Christman is out of print. Ibach and Luth is a little too thin and leaves out many important details. Burns may be a good choice if I teach this course again, altough it is somewhat dated.

I would consider Ibach & Lueth as an introductory text, while Ashcroft & Mermin is more graduate level (and dated). Omar's book is elementary, yet well structured, and the exposition is crystal clear. And if your interests are in semiconductor physics, try Sze's books as well as Cardona's.SSP is a beautiful subject to study, provided that it is properly taught and the student is furnished with well-written books. I hope that someone will come up with a new text and provide a modern treatment of the subject sometimes soon.November 2006 Update: A colleague of mine indicated that the first edition of Kittel's book, which dates back to 1966, was a \\"coherent\\" text, discussing topics in a systematic manner. He indicated that the updates in the ensuing years made it rather disorganized.

It's actually worse than that, because the book simply uses results or assumes familiarity with some technique without stating so much as \\"it is well-known from X...\\"If this weren't bad enough, the main body of the text is cluttered with pedagogically useless references to charts and experimental data.

It presents a wide range of topics in solid state physics at the level of sophistication typical of college seniors or new graduate students in physics. Whenever I am faced with any problem in condensed matter physics, I can confidently turn to Kittel, knowing that there is almost certainly an elementary explanation of the phenomenon in the book and references to further sources for more detailed or advanced treatments.The ordering of topics in the book does not appear to display much continuity. However, the chapters are presented in a rough order of increasing difficulty, which is also the order in which those topics are introduced in a typical solid state physics class. The first twelve chapters, in particular, provide a good outline of a one-semester course in the basics of the subject. The ordering of the later chapters in not as logical, but the selection of topics used by instructors beyond the basics is very diverse. Introduction to Solid State Physics covers most of the interesting further topics that could reasonably be covered by a student familiar with the first half of the text.In covering these further topics, the latest edition of the book offers a great deal of information about current topics in physics. The treatment of magnetic resonance, while hardly exhaustive, treats the major methods of the field in enough detail that an interested student could easilty learn more. Many of the topics, such as interface physics, are relatively new, but Kittel's treatment is excellent, stressing new experimental results whenever possible.Kittel provides a great deal of experimental data as examples and to help the reader form a physical intuition about the effects being discussed. Moreover, the level of the physics and math required are not terrible advanced. For example, rather than delving into the details of BCS theory in the lengthy chapter on superconductivity, Kittel instead spends time on the experimentally observed facts of the phenomenon, treating Type I and Type II superconductors, the details of the Meissner effect, and other empirical topics.The greatest weakness of the book is its somewhat awkward prose. However, an interested student should have little trouble with Kittel's style if he starts with the relatively easy early chapters, to get used to the style of writing."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"... until I cared about actually learning the topic instead of trying to pass a class and do homework. This text is pretty amazing, and on the level of Landau/Lifshitz's theory of 'every single sentence counts'.

I was in the group of people frothing at the mouth over this book, but now I find it very accessible and prefer it to Ashcroft's text. The two books cover roughly the same material (I don't know why people are calling A&M's more advanced), but Kittel definitely has a style you need to get used to. 'Relentless' is a good word, actually. But if you learn to trust what Kittel is trying to do, you will end up in a good place at the end.(And rote memorization never hurt anyone.) He is trying to lay a rough foundation and preparation of things to come, a proper quantum treatment of condensed matter theory. There is a method to his madness, and all of the explanations and examples everyone is looking for are there, in the depths of the figures, context, and periodic tables he provides. Trust in Kittel, he may seem like a sadomasochist at first, but, as many are saying, there is a reason this is a standard text. Like many good texts, the more you hate it at first, the more you love it when you understand it after the fact. Have a good fight with this book. You'll thank Kittel if you continue on in physics."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"This book cannot be used to learn solid state physics. Kittel has a problem with leaving out large portions of derivations. It seems that with each successive edition he removes essential details in return for covering new science.

This book was one of the main reason that I didn't finish the class until three years later and almost gave up on solid state physics.To be more concrete, some of the problems I have with this beast are:1. Kittel has the annoying habit of saying somethings first, and motivating it afterwards. In the beginning, I found myself constantly agitated because I didn't understand a thing he said. Desperately, I read on and found that he was explaining it on the next page.2. The constant mixture of qm and classical physics annoyed me.3.

He skips many steps in his derivations of basic equations,yet he wastes a lot of space trying to illuminate some obscure detail that only a specialist would be interested in. There are very few end of chapter problems and even fewer that are solvable based on his bare-bones chapters. Many seemingly difficult problems are in fact mathematically trivial (i.e. a few lines of high school math, or freshman calculus), but there is no way average students can figure them out no matter how many times they re-read the chapter.

The approaches make little sense for someone who eventually wants to be able to research. No physical interpretations are given. No examples are given. The first 6 chapters feel like a mere summary of a random assortment of topics with no effort to delve deeper. The problems at the end are basic but the texts gives little in the way to interpret or solve these problems. Too much is left up to classical treatments. If you are taking a course like this then you should be beyond the need for that. Its hard to find any merits to this book.

The writing in it is awful, and sadly contributes to the stereotype that scientists do not know how to write. It is foolish to always give conclusions before derivations. It gives no motivation whatsoever for approaching certain questions nor the methods in which they are approached. It moves in a very inconsistent manner, developing topics very much at random, most annoyingly fading in and out of discussion of electronic models (Drude, Sommerfeld, Boch, weak periodic, etc). These models are at the core of the development of the field, and Kittel just kind of weaves in and out of random topics without bothering to explain why to describe things in such a manner (no discussion of why phonons are a good way to discuss system, no discussion of why we should obsess over k-space to describe every problem). Ashcroft and Mermin, by comparison, is a fantastic textbook which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"The popularity of this text is mysterious and unfortunate, because it could be so much better. Kittel's prose is simply awful: disjointed, sometimes almost to the point of incoherence, and some of his affectations (writing acronyms as if they were words: &quot;Ac&quot; and &quot;Dc&quot;) I find annoying. He often explains what could be simply stated, but simply states what must be explained: e.g., he loves to toss off rigorous-sounding mathematical one-liners, where he could explain more carefully why the result actually means what he says. Some topics are belabored, but other topics simply sketched, without any clear reason why.I suspect that this is the most popular intro text because its problems are much easier than Ashcroft &amp; Mermin's, and Ziman's text lacks problems entirely. For experimentalists who have to teach an intro course, this provides a level of protection.To be fair, this text book does cover some topics in more depth and cover more steps in some derivations than the other two I mentioned.

For instance, we were asked to solve something for x-ray diffraction and though we had a little bit of an understanding a la Kittel, we found that that little tidbit of knowledge could not in fact be used with confronted with data or a simple experimental setup. There are simply no examples. We have not read Ashcroft or the other books suggested, but after I write this review, we will certainly be out there to purchase another book.I just wanted to say that I'm sorry we harbored the professor that wrote ths book.

I dutifully bought both, but by the midpoint of the semester hardly ever opened Kittel. Solid state physics is a hard, subtle subject, tempting the author of an introductory textbook to offer results to be memorized, rather than explanations to be understood; Kittel succumbs to this temptation repeatedly. In doing so he leaves the serious student frustrated. The book would perhaps satisfy someone seeking a final course in solid state physics, hoping to gobble up as many facts as possible in a single semester, but it does not offer a good introduction to the study of the subject.I wholeheartedly recommendSolid State Physicsby Ashcroft & Mermin as a replacement; it is a beautifully written, carefully thought out book that shows not only what, but wherefrom."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"This book has been compared so much with A&M; that I have a suggestion - read both together! There are some parts in Kittel where a better treatment can be found in A&M;, such as the treatment on Bravais lattice. And A&M; goes into greater detail into some topics such as the Drude and Sommerfeld theory of metals. But I feel that there are many areas where Kittel is superior simply because the notation is simpler and the treatment more concise. See, for instance, the material on the empty lattice approximation and energy bands. Kittel is also more updated, and the 8th edition includes a chapter on nanostructures written by Paul McEuen.Kittel is not a perfect book, but neither is A&M.; The two, however, seem to complement each other.

To the best of my knowledge, by no means there is a lack of books on solid state physics. In the past, I have studied from books such as Omar, Ashcroft &amp; Mermin, Ibach &amp; Lueth, Kittel and Dekker and, in my opinion, Kittel is the least effective one among those. For some reason, the organization of the book is quite unorthodox. The chapters are, in my opinion, very disconnected. The topics are not developed by following a sensible line of reasoning which is indeed the foremost requirement of a textbook. One needs to make quantum jumps, back and forth, between chapter to unit the comcepts in a meaningful and coherent manner. Regrettably, I would not recommend this book as an introductory text to SSP. Otherwise the uninitiated student may quite easily develop a ill-posed dislike for a &quot;beautiful&quot; area in physics. I'd say start with Omar and proceed onto Ashcroft and Mermin. Ibach and Luth is also a good primer. If you want to learn more about SSP as applied to Semiconductors then Sze's book is the right choice."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"As somebody mentionned the best part of this book are the tables of physical properties. That said, I don't like this book either. There is a solution manual to this book, if you can get your advisor or whoever to sign a letter for it. I don't like this book for a few reasons. First, the explanations aren't that clear. I can't really say why but I've seen better. Second the topic choices in the dielectric and magnetism sections are a little strange (you'll have to compare different books to see what I mean). The section on Fourier transforms and diffraction is confusing. In short I wouldn't get this book. For an undergrad I'd recommend Omar, for a grad student Ashcroft and Mermin is the classic text, though it assumes you know math and Q.M. For the life of me I can't figure out why this book is so popular. In one way, all SS physics books are doomed to fail: because there is so much to cover you're either going to miss some of the detail easy stuff that helps (like A+M) or not be really complete (like most of the undergrad books). Kittel doesn't really do either very well."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"If you can read through every page of Kittel's ISSP, then you are really tough and understand solid state physics.

Looked new but for less than half of the new price love it."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"Before I embark on my review of this book, I want to mention that I am not the kind of student who relies on the professors instruction when learning a new subject. I always take careful notes, and then pour over the book with sharp attention to detail. Having said that, I do not believe that this book is one in which crucial details regarding the subject can be obtained and synthesized. I believe Kittel, despite his long and distinguished career in solid state physics, has been rendered incapable of teaching the subject due to his extensive knowledge of the subject. He frequently makes statements that, although no doubt make perfect sense to him, leave the student perplexed. Moreover, he frequently relies on techniques that do not serve to illuminate the underlying physical concepts. An example of this is his chapter on band structure. In it, Kittel discusses the reduced zone scheme for calculating band structures, with the result that the student is left with not an inkling of an idea what it means, what it serves to illustrate, or how one could even replicate the procedure for a different case. Despite the fact that this model is not useful to my knowledge in actual solid state physics, key physical ideas are left out that illustrate how bands are actually formed in solids. This type of analysis, in which the student is left with a foggy and/or incomplete understanding of the concepts, is disturbingly common. If you are looking for a book that illustrates in clear terms the ideas of solid state physics appropriate for an undergraduate course in the subject, I recommend the wonderful (albeit outdated) book on solid state physics by Omar Ali."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"In my opinion this text(i have the seventh edition) is a very good introduction to solid state physics.The strong point is the attempt to build a &quot;coeherent&quot; theory of the solid state from the very basics.All the major areas of solid state physics are introduced.There is a good use of experimental tables which is very welcome and a careful and student-friendly approach to developing and motivating the needed analytical instruments.No other book(Ashcroft Mermin and many others) in my opinion comes even close to this at the undergraduate level.5 stars!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"This book is terrible.

There are no examples, Kittel doesn't really explain pictures and graphs very well. He doesn't state things in the most logical manner or concise manner. Maybe Kittel is a genius but not at writing an introductory book from what I have seen. There's really no help beyond your fellow students, and professor on solving any of the problems. Moreover, Kittel leaves a lot of steps out of his derivations. We were assigned to derive the Debye T^3 model, which only took Kittel I think a page, page and a half at most. It took me and a fellow student 8 or 9 pages of derivations.I will pass the course with probably an A, but honestly if asked what I have learned, I probably couldn't tell you anything more than a short discussion on lattice points.Professors, please try to find better material, there is better out there."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"Generations of solid state physics students, including myself, have been brought up using this text by Kittel.

I have resolved never again to make my students suffer with this text. Ashcroft & Mermin is wonderful book, but too advance as an introductory text.

As my first contact with Solid State Physics it proved, above all, disorganized. Sometimes you have to reread a paragraph (or a whole section) because the explanation to the beginning is in the end of it. I also felt a serious lack of physical intuition over the phenomena at stake. Sometimes two (would be) comparable graphics were side by side with totally different scales and looks, rendering the comparison difficult. Maybe as a reference it could be used, mostly because of the many tables encountered throughout it. But they are present in other (better) books too...

I know it's hard to find a good SSP book, but so far, Ashcroft and Mermin's is the best."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"This is a classic in its field. I wonder why? It's by far one of the worst books I read in physics, math or electronics. It's disjointed, jumping around. Unfortunately when I was a student this book was our textbook. I tried other books--I enjoyed the first few chapters of Ashcroft's book a lot more, but even that book degenerated in later chapters. If this book is assigned to you as a textbook, don't give up on Solid State, just try some other books. Any other book has to be better."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"Wanting to brush up on magnetism recently, I consulted my 6th edition of Kittel, and quickly remembered why I hated this book so much. It was used in a senior undergraduate physics course that I took as a graduate student in solid state chemistry. As an instructor myself now, I simply cannot tolerate textbook authors who are incapable of writing pedagogically.What is wrong with Kittel?1. The prose does not flow and is so terse that the need to read between the lines translates to reading another book altogether.2. Topics are not properly introduced or motivated, and equations are often produced without defining symbols and without careful physical interpretation.3. And yet some incredibly banal statements are made. In the section on magnetism of rare-earth ions, Kittel mentions that radii decrease on going across the f-elements, and then says, &quot;This is the 'famous' lanthanide contraction.&quot; There is nothing particularly famous about this trend; in general, on going from left to right across any row of the periodic table, the radii decrease. I also doubt that a typical physics major would have taken an inorganic chemistry course to have been aware of this 'famous' observation. He then concludes (I'm paraphrasing), &quot;thus,... (the lanthanides) are the most interesting elements in the periodic table.&quot; What a laughably ignorant comment. Our own research focuses on rare-earth elements, and they are interesting in their own right, but I would hardly make such a foolhardy claim in front of other chemists.Kittel has some good reference tables which I consult from time to time, but if you want to learn solid state physics, there are other superior texts in the market. Just a couple of alternatives: Rosenberg's little paperback is a delight to read because it focuses on physical interpretation rather than getting bogged down on the mathematics. The standard graduate solid state physics text should be Ashcroft and Mermin, which is also a pleasure to read, but assumes a strong mathematical grounding.Textbooks tend to diminish in readability with further editions, and I would extrapolate that the 7th edition would not be any better than the preceding one. But to give Kittel some credit, his solid state book is at one notch better (hence the rating of 2) than his statistical thermodynamics book, &quot;Thermal Physics&quot;. That last one is even worse."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"I like this book. It's great to keep around as a reference. Any edition will do.

In fact many of bad review regard the fact that the text is not an introductory one because it assume a priori knowledge of Classical Mechanics,Classical Electrodynamics,Quantum Mechanics etc. I say that only crazy people could think to start to study Solid State Physics,that is an advanced branch of Physics ,without having a minimal knowledge of Classical and Quantum Physics. It is like if a Math student says that a book on introductory differential geometry is not good because assume a priori knowledge on differential calculus. It is obvious that you must have some basis in this field of physics because if it were not so you have a book of at least one thousand pages so dense of cross reference and digression in the other field of Physics so that you lose the logic path of the matter.Hence start from here your trip in the land of Solid State Physics and then you can, in more easily and satisfactory manner, pursue one's studies of this theory using more in-depth text that make appeal to group theory or a more heavier quantum description"},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"This book does not, in any stretch of the imagination, deserve to be the \\"standard text.\\" Utterly incapable of educating willing subjects."},{"Title":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","review":"I wanted to plunge directly to learn solid state physics and i bought the most widely used book in town.

Of course, it's also necessary to understand classical mechanics for many of the argurments used in say, lattice vibrations and whatnot. Unfortunately, there is no easy way in. All the other introductory solid state books that don't use any mathematics, or minimize its use, do a very poor job of really describing sold state phenomena.Kittel is an excellent author and the range and depth of topics described in this book are really very nice and at just the perfect level. If you think SSP is hard from this book, try looking at any of the \\"quantum theory of solids\\" type books, where the \\"real\\" physics is done.

Her contrast of the Marxian and Hegelian views show us both the continuing attraction of Marxism as well as its fatal flaws, and make us understand why a 160 year old debate is still relevant.In an age where discourse is often reduced to televised shouting matches, the half-baked opinions of celebrities and carefully crafted statements matched to opinion poles, read Himmelfarb to re-discover what intelligent argument and essays can and should be."},{"Title":"On Looking Into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society","review":"Himmelfarb's observations on post-modern 'history' are right on target. The apologists for the Holocaust (revisionism is always apologetics) in academia are hideously indifferent to the greatest devastation and assault on humanity ever known. I had to laugh at the post-modern historian's lament about the 'fact fettish' of traditional historians. This book may be considered the starting point in the inquiry on why many students leave academia less able to think critically than when they enter. This is a tragedy, particularly because the 'new' history (or literature or psychology, etc.) is so boring and formula-driven that a daily newspaper is more informative, relevant, and interesting in comparison.

And since then, generations of intelligent students under the guidance of their enlightened professors have looked into the abyss, have contemplated those beasts, and have said, 'How interesting how exciting.' Today, students in some of the most distinguished departments of literature are all too often reading books about how to read books.

Structuralism and deconstruction, gender theory and the new historicism, reader-response and speech-act theory-these are more hotly debated than the content and style of particular novels or poems.\\"P.17 \\"This is the intention behind some of the most fashionable schools of history: that which explains everything in terms of race, class, and gender; that which focuses entirely upon the daily lives of ordinary people; that which structuralizes history, displacing individuals, events, and ideas by impersonal structures, forces, and institutions. The effect in each case is to mute the drama of history, to void it of moral content, to mitigate evil and belittle greatness. Looking into the most fearsome abysses of modern times, these historians see not beasts but faceless bureaucrats, not corpses but statistics.\\"There is a whole chapter on Marx and his writings. Also a chapter on the significance in the long story of history of nationalism and post modernism."},{"Title":"On Looking Into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society","review":"With impressive scholarship, keen insight and courteous polemics, Himmelfarb challenges the intellectual deception and spiritual poverty of our era. Most of the essays examine the trash that's become intellectually fashionable since the1980s. The title essay braves the swamps of postmodernism inhabited by the demons of nihilism, irrationality and immorality. She dissects deconstruction and related pseudo-philosophies particularly for their baleful effect upon philosophy, literary criticism and historical studies. In the madhouse of deconstruction, the interpreter takes precedence over the text that is interpreted, with comical or insane results. The objective is to undermine reality by denying that it exists.She warns of the consequences when we are informed that philosophy has nothing to do with wisdom or virtue, that metaphysics is really linguistics, that morality is a form of aesthetics and that the best approach is not to take philosophy seriously. And about what happens to our sense of the past when we are told there is no past except that which the historian creates, or to our perception of the significance of history when we are assured that it is we who give it meaning, or to that terrifying historical event, the Holocaust, when it can be so easily 'demystified' and 'deconstructed'?Hegel deified Reason, arguing that every individual could rely on their own reason, accepting as true what seems rational according to individual judgment. Thus a train of thought was set in motion that led to Feuerbach representing religion as the failure of humanity's critical reason and Max Stirner claiming the Ego as the only reality. The destination becomes obvious. Himmelfarb shows up many contradictions in Marx: his habit of portraying his proletarian protagonist in pejorative ways, his counterfactual assertion that the needy would forever become poorer and thesinister sacrificial visionlurking behind his materialist interpretation of history. The author's epitaph for Marx has proved to be far too optimistic: the collectivist serpent returns from Hades again and again.The essay on Liberty confronts the icon of modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill. She convincingly argues that his doctrine of the absolute freedom of the individual inevitably leads to relativism. And if truth can be relativized, morality will follow. She laments our materialist culture that bans unhealthy foods but not sadistic movies and forbids racial segregation but not moral degradation. Absolute liberty tends to subvert the very freedom it seeks to maintain as it grants itself the right to assault the foundations. This was also clearly pointed out by Polanyi in his seminal work Science, Faith and Society.The Dark and Bloody Crossroads Where Nationalism and Religion Meet includes a comparison between the newer versus the established nation states. As the newer ones become more assertive and brutal, the older nations are becomingspineless and passive, ashamed of affirming the legitimacy of their own benevolent expression of nationalism and afraid of challenging the legitimacy of the oppressive tribal mode. The same can be said for Western standards of decency and what's left of our religion. In this regard, The Return of History and the End of Dreams by Robert Kagan is most relevant.Himmelfarb believes that the historian should be able to identify heroes and villains in history and judge their behavior. The denial of good and evil trivializes theShoah/Holocaust and the Gulag. It is incumbent upon us to maintain the reality of the past. She maintains that professionalism in history respects the reader and our ancestors whilst upholding the credibility of the discipline. The practice of professionalism confirms the humility of the serious historian that rejects both the arrogant claim to exactly recapture the past and the ludicrous notion of the past's unreality.Historians educated in the old school of footnoting is struck by the increasing number of academic publications that have no notes at all and even boasts about their lack of sources. The skeptic Voltaire called historical details \\"the pests that destroy books.\\" His heirs the postmodernists have taken this disdain for research to extremes by denying truth itself. The fatuousness with which postmodernists proclaim the failure of beauty, truth and value contrasts sharply with the reverence of the modernists who defined it. Chantal Delsol sets out an interesting diagnosis of this affliction in her books Icarus Fallen andThe Unlearned Lessons Of the Twentieth Century.Himmelfarb explains how postmodernist historians long to be considered creative and imaginative but by rejecting the causal and chronological narrative, they turn history into fiction. Like all honest historians,the modernistswere aware that total objectivity is impossible but they still pursued it through the critical evaluation of evidence. They placed a premium on research and primary sources, the authenticity of documents, reliability of witnesses, the need to obtain substantiating and countervailing evidence, the accuracy of quotations and citations and prescribed forms of documentation in footnotes and bibliography.Postmodernistphilosophy holds truth in such contempt that one doubts the jokers themselves believe their assertions. Just like literary critics play with texts by twisting them in a myriad ways, so postmodern historians tell tales aimed at empowering whatever victim group is the flavor of the moment. Himmelfarb's abyss refers to the chasm of meaninglessness and despite her courtesy, at times a tone of exasperation and more rarely of revulsion surfaces in her writing. She takes on both the originators like Nietzsche, Mill, De Mann and Heidegger and their disciples such as inter alia Derrida, Foucault and Rorty.I also recommendThe Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politicsby Mark Lilla, Last Exit to Utopia by Jean-Franois Revel, Explaining Postmodernism by Stephen Hicks,Why Truth Mattersby Ophelia Benson & Jeremy Stangroom, Experiments Against Reality by Roger Kimball and the same author'sTenured Radicalsin the 3rd edition of which he demonstrates how the trends he observed in the early 1990s had taken over the humanities and started to seep into popular culture within the space of a decade."},{"Title":"On Looking Into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society","review":"\\"Formerly, when historians invoked the idea of imagination, they meant the exercise of imagination required to transcend the present and immerse oneself in the past. This is the genius attributed to the great nineteenth-century historians: 'empathy, imagination, the attempt to place oneself in an historic situation and into an historic character without prejudgment.' For the postmodernist it means exactly the opposite: the imagination to create a past in the image of the present and in accord with the prejudgment of the present-minded historian.\\"- Gertrude Himmelfarb(From: Postmodernist History)Essay List -On Looking into the AbyssOf Heroes, Villains, and ValetsFrom Marx to HegelLiberty: \\"One Very Simple Principle\\"?The Dark and Bloody Crossroads Where Nationalism and Religion MeetWhere Have All the Footnotes Gone?Postmodernist History"},{"Title":"On Looking Into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society","review":"The moral debility of our Western universities has no more incisive a critic than Gertrude Himmelfarb.

In the middle of buying film equipment, trying to put finishing touches on two scripts, editing a friend's screenplay and working through an out-sourcing at my work - the last thing I needed was a book with a lot of \\"high-falutin'\\" words and abstract comments when it comes to writing. Just tell me about story and lets get on with it.That, of course, was my assumption. How pleasantly surprised I was when the book I read was an honest, open and easy read about \\"Story.\\" I will admit that, sometimes, I want to get away from books that take storytelling to a level of grandiose and mythic proportions. Where I almost tremble with fear when I put pen to paper or digits to keyboard - but this book is not that. This book is a straight-forward and very basic book about story. ALL about story: Character Development, Structure, Dialogue and, of course, Conflict. And more.Is it a book for \\"Beginners?\\" I do not know if I would classify this book as \\"How to Write a Story 101\\" - but I can tell you that Ms. Jones's format is one that is very basic and very truthful and that anyone starting to write or an old (unproduced) veteran such as myself can learn something in these pages and can grow as a writer. In some ways I would say this book does an excellent job of reeling in the abstract to get a writer back to the basics and I, frankly, think we all need that once in a while.Where the book falters, a bit, is in the fact that most every chapter ends with \\"Exercises\\" to do. Out of all my classes and many conversations with writers I've never met one person who said that they did the exercises found in books such as these. Most of the time they're too excited and want to move on to the next chapter. I would rather the exercises be moved to the back of the book or removed altogether and replaced with more horror (and not so horror) stories of Ms. Jones's journey from the stage to Hollywood. And yes, dear readers, this book is written by someone who has actually had success in Hollywood and knows what she is talking about.One other plus in this book is that she fills the book with quotes on writing. Wonderful quotes from all across the spectrum. I will include one of my favorite quotes that she did not include:\\"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit at a typewriter and open a vein.\\" Walter (\\"Red\\") Smith - American SportswriterBottom line: Ms. Jones does a wonderful job reminding the reader that it is all about the story. This is a great book for beginners and professionals alike."},{"Title":"The Way of Story: The Craft and Soul of Writing","review":"It was the subtitle of this book about writing that drew me to it: The Craft and Soul of Writing. The use of the word \\"soul\\" in connection with writing stopped me in my tracks. I too believe that good writing comes from the soul, yet my writing always has sounded more like a lawyer's brief than a soulful memoir or story. And so I wondered... Might this book free me from my mental prison? My hopes soared when on the first page, I read, \\"The whole of life can be a meditation, even writing.\\" Clearly, I was in the hands of a philosopher as well as a writer. Here was a book which combined practical guidelines with spiritual experience.I left the bookstore, looking at the book's unusual cover--a picture of an elderly fellow seated in a large old rowboat, its empty space in the rear crowded with colorful flowers. He uses a single wooden oar to paddle through the wide open sea as sprays of watery foam hit his face and obstruct his view. I see this as a metaphor for the obstacles and endlessly murky situations humans encounter as they row their way through each and every day, experiencing both the beauty they enjoy and the unpredictable vicissitudes that inevitably become obstacles along the way.Numerous brilliant, relevant quotes by famous people appear on every page of The Way of Story. They remind the reader of the importance of soul to writing, of the path that writing must take in order to include the elusive soul. I read the profound and unique philosophies of such luminaries as Winston Churchill, Rimbaud, Harold Clurman, Lao Tzu, and many more, all of whom guide us to honor the soul. And we honor the soul by listening, by being still, by believing passionately in ourselves. \\"Passion,\\" Jones writes, \\"must come first, then craft. The essence of Art is to use the outer form to convey an inner experience. This sacred thread, your innermost being or Soul, binds you emotionally to what you write, and if given respect, will lead you on to the desired end. Stories written from this center will move mountains--and even create livelihoods. Years ago, when interviewed by the New York Times about my approach to teaching, I was quoted as saying, 'We've become lopsided living only in our heads. Writing, in order to serve the Soul, must integrate outer craft with the inner world of intuition and feeling.'\\"This book has become my bible because I am among those who are lopsided. And for all those writers who believe they are lopsided, Jones offers excellent guidance. Among the numerous suggestions she offers is a remarkable exercise called Soul Dialogue, in which she guides us to envision our soul, to learn from it what it wants, what it truly wants, and sincerely wishes to communicate to others. This message pervades her book. One of the many quotes I will always remember comes from another spiritual teacher--Butoh, a famous Japanese dancer: \\"The Soul is the important thing. Form will follow.\\"Form is the craft; soul, the art and passion. The author insists that the goal of writing is to reach the essence of feeling. She shares stories revealing how she has achieved this. An example was a day when Jones was in an acting class with the famous teacher, Uta Hagen. Jones was playing Ophelia. Having already played Shakespearean roles for a well known director in England, she felt confident that her improvisation was a good one. Until Ms. Hagen shouted, \\"I want you to play an Ophelia I believe goes to the bathroom!\\" At the time, she was stunned by her failure, but she carries this lesson over to writing. \\"Characters,\\" she reminds us, \\"must be three-dimensional, grounded, and not just an extension of the writer's projected aesthetic imagination.\\"The essence of the author's advice is to dare to be personal. Jones reminds us that how we remember is how we give meaning to our lives. Lao Tzu asks, \\"How do I know about the world?\\" His answer: \\"By what is within me\\"--five important words I have placed on my mirror where I can see them each morning before I begin my day.Catherine Ann Jones does not overlook the supreme importance of craft, and she is nothing less than inspiring in her chapters delineating the various genres. She covers the more obvious and less interesting ones (to me) such as structure, rewrites, outlines and dialogue. But her book is about so much more--about the voice of character and how to convey it, the unexpected synchronicities of writing, the resource of memory, the writer's voice, discovering your personal myth, one woman's remarkable story. She believes we must pay no attention to what will happen to the work, whether it will succeed in the marketplace, whether it will even reach the marketplace, quoting Robert Frost... \\"All the great things are done for their own sake.\\"There is no way to do this book justice in a brief review. Like most things in life, this book must be experienced to be fully known and appreciated. I can promise any student of writing, experienced writers, and anyone merely interested in learning more about the craft that this book will make you glad you did not leave it behind in the bookstore.by Duffie Bartfor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"The Way of Story: The Craft and Soul of Writing","review":"After a ten year sabbatical from \\"serious\\" writing while I concentrated on making a living as a technical writer; and a three-year bout of taking care of and eventually saying goodbye to failing parents, it seemed that every original, clever, creative idea I ever had for story, character, or setting had been flushed out of my head with Drano.Right-brain cluttered and left-brain heartbroken, I could barely find the spirit to pick up a pencil, let alone get down to serious writing. Catherine's book, The Way of Story, helped me renew fertility to those little places inside me that nurture creativity and desire to write, and trust that all those little idea seeds have stored inside them everything I need to create a fantasy world. The result was a renewed writing spirit and the completion of a novel as haunting and beautiful as I imagined it could be.I am especially grateful for the wise and insightful choice of quotes Catherine included from great writers and philosophers. These have often led me down paths I might not have explored. While I have done many of the exercises, some of them several times, I've yet to complete them all and look forward to those little bits of time I reserve to seek out another one to try.

A writer who inspires writers to write while at the same time sharing her insights into and experience of the actual writing business. Spice is added to the mix with anecdotes sprinkled throughout about the many famous creative people she has known and met.'To be an artist of any kind in a time in history that does not value the creative fields provides a continuing tension in relation to the art of survival. Still, you have the advantage of living your dream,' says Jones. After relating an incident where a wealthy NY doctor told her he had always wanted to be a writer but hadn't because his father who had been a doctor expected him tobe one too, she notes that he probably earns a lot more money than she does, then quotes sculptor Louise Nevelson, who said, 'You pay a price for what you do, and you pay a price for what you don't do.' Jones commentsthat 'the plain truth is you must choose which price to pay'. She believes that those who do not do as they want to do pay the greater price, and says, 'The challenge is to hold the tension and let it work within you in acreative, constructive manner...This inner tension aids in creating complex characters strong enough to hold the chaos.'Yes but HOW does a writer create such characters? In a chapter entitled 'Creating Character-Driven Stories', Jones offers pointers to what she calls the 'solid craft' of writing, plus some additional advice to ease the pain of being an unknown, underpaid or forgotten writer, and inspiration to carry on despite all odds set against one, quoting people like Goethe, who observed in 1771: 'Where the light is brightest, the shadows are deepest.'She even offers a whole chapter called 'Transcending Writer's Block', considering what it is and how one may counteract the depression that often accompanies it. 'Creative people are committed to risk,' she nobly says, which somehow clarifies the situation and calms the upset the artist feels when everything is seeming to go badly wrong on the material level.But even success, as she has found, can cause an emptiness to grow in the soul. This led her to escape her success on a coastal walk in Cornwall where she experienced an epiphany upon hearing a small thrushsinging 'for the sheer, natural joy of singing, not for agents or critics'.Then she relates how a publisher rejected Emily Dickinson's poems in 1866, offering to teach her grammar. Dickinson's poems were found only after her death 'wrapped in a carefully sewn parcel, hidden under the carpet'.As Catherine Ann Jones says, sometimes time and space are required to 'prepare the ground' for writing, as is courage to 'risk everything for the moment' while remaining 'open to change'. Finally she reveals her secret: that writing arises from meditation on something greater than herself, that it is her way of expressing her connection with that greater something.Aside from the invaluable exercises and tips on what she calls the writer's 'craft', this is a deeply personal and honest account of what it means to be a writer, and of how to use writing as a meditation practice so that your intuition may be freed enough that it will just possibly lead you to the door of greatness.- Amy Corzine, Author of THE SECRET LIFE OF THE UNIVERSE: THE QUEST FOR THE SOUL OF SCIENCE (Watkins, UK, 2008); a graphic novel adaptation of JANE EYRE (Classical Comics, UK, 2008); and TAKE THE KIDS: IRELAND (Cadogan Guides, UK, 2nd ed. 2006)"},{"Title":"The Way of Story: The Craft and Soul of Writing","review":"Reading The Way of Story is like having a talk with a trusted, intelligent and interesting friend.

It's not like other writing books, full of tecniques and formulas. What I liked about the book is it mainly focused on trusting your heart and point of view as a writer.

Dubner is the child of two first generation Brooklyn Jews, who had each converted to Catholicism during the second world war. They met, married, moved to Upstate New York and had eight children. Stephen was the youngest. When he was nine his father died, and Stephen began dreaming about a mysterious, black Italian, Pittsburgh Steelers football player named Franco Harris. Stephen signed his school papers Franco Dubner, and wore a Steelers Jersey. He fiercely followed Harris' life and career for all the years of his lonely childhood and adolescence. Twenty years later, a grown man, a published author, a New York Times magazine editor and writer, Dubner caught sight of his boyhood hero's picture on the cover of Black Enterprise magazine. He was seized by a strong desire to find his boyhood hero and try to understand the meaning of his long and passionate hero worship. Dubner's search is an extraordinary story of love, loss, and healing. The writing is beautiful and honest. I laughed and cried. Even the descriptions of Harris' football playing held my interest, and I am no sports fan. This is a tremendously moving, authentic story of how the human spirit can transcend the most terrible tragedy, with glorious grace."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"It seemed like a simple story about a man who tracks down his childhood hero. Becomes much more than that, though. It's about life, love, football, fatherhood, sonhood, etc. Dubner is a great writer. Smart, funny, gentle, with an old-fashioned ear for storytelling. Couldn't put it down, was really sad when it ended."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"Having read, enjoyed and reviewed Mr. Dubner's first book, &quot;TURBULENT SOULS&quot;, I was most anxious to read his latest book, &quot;CONFESSIONS OF A HERO WORSHIPPER&quot;. I found the book to be full of entertaining humor as Mr. Dubner seeks out and finds his childhood hero, Franco Harris, star football player of the Pitttsburgh Steelers. It also explains the need of a hero to come into Mr. Dubner's life to help him deal with the loss of his own father when Stephen was a small boy.This is a most enjoyable easy read....a pleasant true story."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"I too worshipped a sports God in my youth-in my case, it was Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins. Thus, I could relate to Dubner's moving tribute to his hero, Franco Harris. I know what it is like to be a teenager and to think that this person really would be your good friend if only they knew you.Dubner takes one small aspect of American society shared by many people-the worship of a sports hero at a young age-and explores it. He meets Harris as an adult and decides to write a book on him. Only the experience doesn't turn out to be the dream of a lifetime. In many ways, it is more of a nightmare.The reader feels for both the author and Harris. Franco Harris clearly is an athlete who has moved on with his life, much to his credit. At times, the author seemed to almost stalk him. Yet you feel for the author also. No one should lose the image of a hero at any stage in his or her life.I would recommend this book for sports lovers of all ages and both genders. If you're not into sports, then this would be a more challenging read. Yet most people have heroes in their youth in many arenas (sports, history, politics), so in that sense, the book's theme is universal."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"After reading Stephen Dubner's first book, Turbulent Souls, I couldn't wait to read his latest work. I thoroughly enjoyed Confessions of a Hero Worshiper. It is a poignant, beautifully-written story about Dubner, who as a ten-year-old boy, grasped on to his football hero to help him survive his loneliness and insecurity after his father died. Dubner's childhood hero was Franco Harris of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the \\"man of steel\\" becomes much more to the young, fatherless boy than anyone would ever imagine. In school Dubner even wrote his name as \\"Franco Dubner\\" on his papers. For the next 4 years, Dubner has the same dream every night of meeting Franco Harris, inviting him over to his house for dinner, and playing a game of football in the backyard with him afterwards. Every night in the dream, Franco breaks his ankle just as he's about to score a touchdown. He hands the ball to Dubner and tells him, \\"You gotta take it from here yourself, kid.\\" The words end up being prophetic.Fast forward about twenty-five years. Dubner is now a successful writer and former editor of the NY Times Magazine. When he spies a magazine cover sporting Franco Harris's picture, his long-buried feelings are rekindled. Dubner is overcome by a deep desire to meet his hero and let him know what an important part he played in Dubner's young life.When Dubner finally gets to rubs elbows with Franco Harris, the time spent with him and his athlete buddies is both exhilerating and frustrating. What transpires between them over the next months enables Dubner to finally shed his childhood ghosts when he comes to an epiphany of sorts. The story is both a heartfelt and at times hilarious account of Dubner's trip back into his past as he comes to grips with the present and discovers the secret to his future.The story is so engaging and well-written that I couldn't put it down...and me, a sports fan...NOT!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"It's easy to get caught up in the little details of our lives, getting kids off to school, getting the car (or dog) fixed, paying the mortgage, raking the leaves, and doing the thousand other things that we do, so much that we forget or never get the big picture.But it's impossible to get through even a chapter of Confessions of a Hero Worshipper, by Stephen J. Dubner, without stepping back taking a longer look at our own trajectories.In fact, the book, which details a psychic journey of mythic proportions conducted by shuttle between New York and Pittsburgh, is nothing but a long look back at the childhood of the author, carefree until his father's unexpected death at 57 years of age. Dubner proceeded to do what any 10 year old kid would have done, set about to replace that figure, and he promptly selected a football player, Franco Harris of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who in very unlikely fashion proceeded to fill the gap in a profound way. For a time Dubner signed his school work, \\"Franco Dubner.\\"Dubner grew up, went off to college, got a job and pretty much forgot Franco, until a chance sighting of the former football star on a magazine cover ignited a fool's errand, for the author to actually meet his childhood hero and establish a connection.In the process Dubner is forced to re-examine the loss of his father, look long and hard at how he filled that void and, more importantly, take stock of the remaining sense of loss and sorrow.In reading the book, I found it impossible not to examine such holes in my past, as well.I'm currently reading \\"Turbulent Souls,\\" another book by Dubner, which details the strange spiritual and cultural journey taken by his parents, which led them from a life as Jews in New York City to life as committed Catholics on a farm in rural Upstate New York. That's where they all were when I came to know them during my year in Duanesburg as the 13 year shortstop of the local sandlot baseball team."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"Dubner's book had a special meaning to me when I read it. I had just come back from a trip where I met a childhood idol of mine. While the meeting was great, somehow I came home feeling a bit of emptiness.Dubner's tale eventually delves into this emptiness. First, he relates the story of his childhood fascination with Franco Harris, a great running back with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1970's. It is the tale of a typical boy's love of a sports hero. Then, Dubner goes through school and leaves most of this behind. Later, as an adult when he has the chance to meet Harris, the book really hits a high note.Dubner explores his feelings and Franco's feelings as the two meet several times. In the end, it is nothing like he expected or wanted, yet in the end it is exactly that.Anyone who ever called himself a fan of a celebrity should read Dubner's story."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"How could I not love this book? I was born in Pittsburgh, grew up watching the Steelers, and, like the author, lost my father when I was still in grade school.However, Dubner doesn't get the Pittsburgh mindset, despite mining the Steelers story for years (as the articles in the P.S. demonstrate). Pittsburghers do not suffer from an inferiority complex as Dubner asserts. Perhaps living in New York has made him equate not being full of oneself with an inferiority complex. Like most Pittsburghers I know, Franco Harris is open, friendly, down-to-earth, hardworking but a little offbeat and not the least bit full of himself. Perhaps we like Franco not only because of the immaculate reception, but also because he is just like us."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"I agree that this book is profound and beautifully written. I just can't understand why some called the book \\"disjointed,\\" notably the \\"Publisher's Weekly\\" reviewer above who called Dubner's discussion of Carlyle out of place, just digging for material. I found that Carlyle discussion and that whole chapter, \\"A Brief History of Hero Worship,\\" not only incredibly interesting and enlightening (and disturbing), but also perfectly germane. That's the beauty of this book: it manages to weave together deeply personal reflections with insights into broad social patterns,from the history of Pittsburgh and the U.S. to the entire sweep of Judeo-Christianity, as well as sports and crowd psychology, including Carlyle and others. To me, it all hangs together beautifully."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"I've met Stephen Dubner - he's an incredible human being. He seems to be one of those people that just \\"gets it\\". After hearing him speak at my university I decided to borrow all his books from the Library. I read about 2 books a year for pleasure, and when I read I am generally bored out of my mind. That being said, I opened to page 1 of Confessions and didn't stop reading until I finished (except to use the bathroom). It doesn't even matter what Dubner is writing about - his writing style is so effective that you won't be able to stop. He essentially wrote two memoirs about his family life and if you were to read the cliff notes you'd find him to have a relatively normal life - and yet, I found myself dying to get to the next page, next sentence, next word. This guy is a genius writer. The thing I really appreciated about Confessions (and Turbulent Souls) is how honest he is. There are many anecdotes that few people would be comfortable revealing and Stephen is man enough to do so throughout. This book is great insight into the psyche of a hero-worshipper - and should be read by every American - since we so thoroughly worship our \\"heros\\". Get this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"Dubnar takes me back to those years of my childhood when I cared more about Earl Campbell's stats than my family or my school work. I couldn't help but thinking as I read about the adult Dubnar's still relentless quest to bond with Franco, that the guy is a bit of a creeper. Don't think I'd like him as a neighbor, but he wrote a profound book here. Funny how the bond he tried to force with Franco came so easily with Franco's Mom. I had no problem finishing this one."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"I was a little predisposed to enjoying this book for a number of reasons, and I think I should describe them before getting too much into the review.I am nearly the same age as the author, lost my Dad in 1974 and am a lifelong Steelers fan, who grew up well outside Pittsburgh, but followed the team religiously. My Mother was a religious and caring woman, and we were raised in relative poverty. I idolized Jack Lambert (another Steeler) and my own Mother passed away around the same time in life as the authors. In short, the similarities between the author's life and mine are much the same, so that might be relevant in knowing my thoughts on this book.\\"Confessions of a Hero Worshipper\\" takes the reader through the author's childhood and his early search for identity. It gives a vivid description of his Father's death and his attempt at identifying with the star running back of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Franco Harris. Dubner arranges to meet Harris and the book gives a narrative of his frustrations- sometimes comical- at understanding Franco, when in truth, the author was really searching himself. As the book develops, Dubner skillfully explores why people choose to worship heroes and what heroes are. He also discusses the religious aspects of hero worship and concludes that they are a necessity. In a surprise twist, Dubner finds heroic qualities in Mr. Harris' mother, whom he befriends late in the book. He finally breaks free of his need to see Harris as Superhuman after talking with him in a final interview in Mr. Harris' home and through the first years of Dubner's own son's life.Although this book is (as a few other reviewers have pointed out) somewhat disjointed, the prose style is enjoyable and unpredictably funny. Frankly, I did not expect the book to provoke as much thought as it did about why people choose the heroes they do, or the larger meaning of building people into what we want them to be. With the disclaimer of what this book meant personally to me, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper","review":"This book compares the Jewish view to that of Christians. With the Jewish ban on idolatry, there are no people -- only things and places in pictures. That's strange, as my photos are full of views, beautiful or unusual scenes and things of the past, but very few people. In the Bible, there are prophets in abundance, but in the New Testament, the pictures are most always a glorified Jesus and his apostles. A messiah is less a person than an idea, a hope, and the yearning for the world to have a happy ending.Thomas Carlyle, a pious Scottish Presbyterian, who died in 1881, wrote that hero worship is a human condition that \\"cannot cease till man himself ceases.\\" I've had many heroes in my time. One of them is listed below.A hero is someone we admire for who he is, but not so much because he is someone special to us when we need someone to love, a person who can take the place of a busy family, someone you don't come home to and have to listen to their complaints. A hero is perfect, he's an image we conjure up in our minds as being the person we would like to be.Lincoln was shot five days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox on Good Friday; Booth was a crazed hero-worshipper and had to die for his mistake. Each era in America has its hero. Charles Lindbergh in 1927 because he did what no one else had done. General MacArthur in WWII because of his determination and defiance to do what his heart dictated. A Civil War hero, Abner Doubleday, was dubbed \\"father of baseball\\" after his death.We all know that politicians say one thing behind closed doors and another in public. Movie stars and pop singers were \\"images\\" created for a purpose, to give us an imaginary world to enter in the theaters. The superheroes of the comics were Jewish American creations.All of this history to establish his hero-worship for a ball player because of his will to win, mainly the will to survive. His father had been a newspaperman. He became a writer, thus subconsciously was emulating his dead father who was the real hero in his mind. A Mother is a Mother is a Mother...how can she be a hero?

My books only spell out more particularly the theories underlying what's known in the psychological literature as the subliminal psychodynamic activation method. There do appear to be some messages that are psycho-active beneficial for almost all. Another example of this is our forgiveness set of messages.

However, when blame is removed from the equation, personal empowerment follows. I choose to take responsibility instead of displace it through blame.

There are a few chapters on the history and chemistry of this vital process, and they are reasonably well written. But the vast majority of the book is an endless litany of statistics, completely devoid of narrative structure. For example:&quot;In the United Kingdom more than half of all nitrogen fertilizer has been applied to grasslands. A Royal Society study found that in the late 1970s average applications on pastures surpassed the inputs to arable land (172 vs. 135 kg N/ha), and that synthetic compounds accounted for 57-63% of all inputs. The overall use of fertilizer nitrogen in the United Kingdom rose by almost 50% between the late 1970s and the mid 1980s, but it declined afterwards, and its average during the late 1990s has been only about 20% higher than a generation earlier, which means that the synthetic fertilizers supply between 65 and 70% of all nitrogen inputs. But high-yielding winter wheat -- the 1998 mean was 7.97 t/ha -- still receives more than 180 kg N/ha, double the amount applied in 1970 when the yield was around 4 t/ha, and the secular correlation between the rising applications of inorganic nitrogen and rising harvests is obvious (fig. 7.8).&quot;Now imagine 300 more pages of text just like that, and you get the idea. There is no *story* here, just data. It's a shame, because there is definitely a story to be told.The material on the Haber process itself is better, but not great. In particular, the author can't seem to choose the level of the audience: descriptions of chemistry alternate between being too simplistic and assuming too much. Details essential to understanding often seemed to be missing, while details of no apparent relevance are in abundance. I don't really care whether the process takes place under 137 vs. 152 atmospheres; but I do care *why* the pressure is so critical, which is never explained.I really wanted to like this book more than I did. There *is* plenty of good material here, but you have to sort through a lot of empty statistics to get it, and the omission of key pieces of scientific explanation makes for a painfully frustrating read."},{"Title":"Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production","review":"First of all, this is not a book that most people would take to the beach to read, but rather a fairly scientific book on the use of nitrogen in agriculture, as befits a publication of MIT Press.Smil initially set out to write a biography of Fritz Haber, but found that Haber's contribution to agriculture was so much more complicated than he could fit into a biography. Instead, he wrote a history of nitrogen supplements in agriculture. The amount of nitrogen is by far the main determinant of crop yield; within common sense limits, a crop's yield is more or less linearly dependent on how much nitrogen a farmer spreads on his fields. In the 1910s, Fritz Haber and Bosch, devised a way to extract nitrogen from the air; until then farmers had been dependent on compost and the shipments of guano (bird dung) from South America to get more nitrogen onto their fields. The results include a huge increase in crop yields, a huge decrease in the percentage of the population that must toil the fields, a huge increase in literacy and much more.Smil's book is quite interesting to anyone interested by science; if you have a teen that you are trying to interest in science, this is a book you could send his way. If you're averse to the occasional number, equation, graph, or scientific nomenclature, you're best off avoiding this book. These caveats stipulated, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production","review":"This is a great book for any one interested in the way the Haber-Bosch process of making Nitrogen fertilizer changed the world. Enriching the Earth provides in depth information on the history that led up to the discovery of the process of using N2 and H2 to make NH3. It also contains up to date information on the effects that all of this new nitrogen has on the earth.The book can get a little technical at times, with chemical formulas and schematics of the instruments. While I found this information useful, some people might find it overwhelming. If you skip over the techincal parts, the book is very well written for the average person.These little known scientists really changed the world as we know it. When you think about it, what has Einstein done for you lately? These guys put food on the table."},{"Title":"Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production","review":"This is an interesting and interdisciplinary examination of one of the most important technological innovations of the 20th century; the Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation process. To explain the impact of this innovation, Smil explains the importance of nitrogen in the biosphere and agriculture, the complex nitrogen cycle, and has an extended discussion of how the Haber-Bosch process affected modern agriculture and demography. In the first half-two thirds of the book, Smil nicely and concisely cover both the basics of nitrogen cycling, the discovery of the importance of nitrogen in agriculture, and the discovery and implementation of the Haber-Bosch process. Briefly, nitrogen is an essential element for many, many crucial biomolecules including amino acids and nucleotides. While nitrogen is abundant in the biosphere, it is largely in the form of non-bioavailable atmospheric N2. As realized in the first half of the 19th century by talented European scientists, the amount of bioavailable nitrogen in soils is a major limiting factor in soil fertility and agricultural productivity. What is called by some the First Green Revolution in the second half of the 19th century was based on inorganic fertilizers mined from guano and other deposits in South America. By the end of the 19th century, it was quite clear that some substitute for this non-renewable resource would need to be discovered to maintain or increase agricultural productivity. Enter a number of talented chemists, mostly Germans, who worked on this problem in the years just before WWI. Fritz Haber made the crucial breakthrough, developing a method to produce ammonia from atmospheric N2. Carl Bosch, leading a team of talented chemists and engineers at the German firm BASF, rapidly scaled up Haber's process to produce a commercially viable and remarkably productive industrial process.In the remainder of the book, Smil covers further developments of the industrialization of nitrogen fixation, its use in agriculture, and both the productive and deleterious impacts of increased use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. Smil shows the importance of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers for modern agriculture in both developed adn developing nations. He shows that such fertilizers made possible much of the enhanced agricultural productivity of recent years. In developed countries like the USA, this made possible agricultural exports and meat production, in developing nations like China, the expansion of grain production for feeding expanding populations. Smil provides a reasonable estimate of the contribution of inorganic fertilizers to population growth across the 20th century. While the exact number is unknowable, it must be the range of hundreds of millions to 1-2 billion humans. Since most industrially produced inorganic nitrogen fertilizer is based on the Haber-Bosch process, a great deal of world-wide population growth and improved nutrition can be attributed to the achievements of a relatively small number of talented German chemists and engineers working just prior to WWI. Smil is also very good on the negative impacts of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer use, notably eutrophication. This book is an interesting combination of biology, historical research, and demographic analysis."},{"Title":"Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production","review":"No other technology of the 20th Century had more effect on raising the standard of living of the people of the world than the synthesis of ammonia which allowed the population to be several times higher than it otherwise would have been and also greatly reduced hunger and malnutrition in most parts of the world.The book begins with the early science of chemistry and the development of a basic understanding of crop nutrition and the role of nitrogen in the early 1800's. After nitrogen's vital role was established a fertilizer industry based on guano and later Chilean nitrates, but supplies were being depleted. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers were developed in the late 1800's, but the processes were very costly.Fritz Haber built on the works of other chemists and eventually determined conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst) whereby ammonia could be synthesized from hydrogen and nitrogen with a satisfactory yield. The process required high pressures and elevated temperatures which had never been used on an industrial scale before. It was Carl Bosch, a chemical engineer, who believed the process could be commercialized, and proceeded to develop the field of high pressure chemistry.This is an excellent semi-technical book because: 1) subject matter importance, 2) overall it was interesting because it is part historical, part biographical, part popular science, 3) it is exceptionally well researched and documented. However, while it was very easy for a chemical engineer like myself to read, I am not sure it would be appreciated by someone without a similar background, although the sections pertaining to the use of nitrogen fertilizers may be of interest to those involved with agriculture. Also, it is highly recommended to economists involved with the impacts of technology on the economy."},{"Title":"Same Homework, New Plan: How to Help Your Kid Sit Down And Get It Done","review":"Same Homework: New Plan by Sally G.

Unfortunately she has opted to start writing mainstream thrillers. I knew who dunnit very early in the book. Hocus was lousy too. I won't be reading her anymore."},{"Title":"Liar (Irene Kelly Mysteries)","review":"Jan Burke is a good writer. But here, she has con- structed a so called thriller with a plot that is tied to following a preposterous family tree that can only be called absurd. Imagine if you will, a 16 year old illiterate gardener marrying a 45 year old millionairess and himself becoming a self made millionaire because of his innate brilliance. Then, despite becoming a bigamist , he is depicted as one of the most beloved human beings who have ever lived, based on the recollection of all his friends, relatives and associates. On top of this plotting, there is a subplot involving the strange sign language of &quot;hobos&quot; that is off putting and could'nt be more out of place in a novel of this sort. Strange stuff! In addition to all this, there are numerous allusions to a hostage incident involving the heroine's husband that obviously occured in an earlier book that is not explained at all--unless I missed it trying to keep track of the family tree. I have read many books that involve a series where incidents occuring in earlier books are referred to--usually in a way that explains behavior in the current book--but they are always explained. This seems necessary, whether you have read the earlier book or not. I will read Burke again, hopefully because I am sure she has exhausted the exploration of her boring family history. She can do better"},{"Title":"Liar (Irene Kelly Mysteries)","review":"If you love Jan Burke's mysteries-and anyone who loves mysteries will love Jan Burke-then you will love Liar. It is her best book yet.Burke is such a good writer that her characters truly come to life in her books. I feel like I know Irene Kelly, the reporter/sleuth of the series. I am always anxious for the next Irene Kelly book to come out and read about her latest exploits. The wait for this book was well worth it. Liar does not disappoint.Irene investigates the death of her aunt and meets new and strange relatives as she becomes the prime suspect of what the police now believe is a murder. Burke skillfullly weaves the reader through the cast of well written new and familiar characters. This is a crefully crafted book, with a complicated plot, but it is thoroughly readable and enjoyable.

You will love it."},{"Title":"Liar (Irene Kelly Mysteries)","review":"Over two decades ago, Irene's family discovered that her aunt was married to a man who also was married, at the same time, to a wealthy, much older heiress. When the rich woman was found murdered, the bigamist was the only suspect. However, testimony from Irene's aunt and their teenage son gave him an air tight alibi. Since that scandal, the Kelly family has had no contact with the Macguires until it was discovered that Irene's aunt was murdered. Irene is assigned the task of finding her deceased aunt's son Trevor and breaking the news to him.When she finally locates the man and overcomes his resentment towards her and her family for deserting him, she tells him about his mother. A devastated Trevor is unaware that his father is also dead and he is now a wealthy person. Attempts have been made on his life and Irene, who is fond of her cousin, is determined to stop the culprit before Trevor becomes the next victim.Of all the on-going mystery series on the market today, the Irene Kelly novels are one of favorite of this reviewer. The best book in this wonderful collection is the latest, LIAR which turns me into a fibber because I said that about the previous book, HOCUS. The story line is an action-packed mystery, filled with interesting characters whose traits are explored. The trademark Jan Burke prose makes this a winner that deserves to be the breakout book for the talented author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Liar (Irene Kelly Mysteries)","review":"While I read Goodnight Irene and enjoyed it, this novel was just a little too long and just a little too confusing. There were too many characters. I had trouble keeping track of brothers, in-laws, nephews, etc. I found myself trying to finish this book as a pain, not a pleasure. I think I will read the next &quot;Bones&quot;, hoping that Burke has tightened up her act a little. Don't give me 400 pages when 350 would do just as well.

During this conversation she learns about long lost relatives and family feud that started two decades ago. After some sleuthing at thedeceased' s house she locates her cousin Travis. The rest of the book is about Irene learning the truth about things that happened during her parent's marriage and why her mother and aunt was deceased. At some point I gave up on this plot, it just another tired family saga of who did who wrong. The mystery was justthere to give the book a purpose which it failed miserably. I thought after Hocus Burke was hitting her stride as a writer who spins page turning stories. Sadly she returned to the lackluster style of Remember Me Irene. Many times I found myself thinking why am I still reading this and the answer is Frank. If he inthe forefront of the stories then it has meat and I want to read more.

Blessed with unusual powers of observation, Walker proceeds cautiously, and sometimes clumsily, through childhood, worrying about what might happen next. Often, his fears are justfied. As a kid, he's sent to a hell hole of a summer camp. As a teen, he's violated by a quick-draw enema artist of a school nurse. Jack survives it all, and comes through his often hilarious adventures a little wiser, and less innocent. It all makes for a wonderful read, a coming-of-age tale that unfolds as naturally and unhurriedly as a Saturday afternoon baseball game. Heller, a copy editor at the Washington Post, writes with the sensibility of a novelist and the precision of a veteran journalist. He has a gift for dead-on descriptions and small insights that evoke memories of what growing up was really like."},{"Title":"A Long Run Home","review":"Wow, this author has a sense of humour that is quite dry and witty.

What Holloway offers in this handy little book is plenty of food for thought on this most sacred and mysterious of topics. He deftly cuts through to the humanity of all involved and so makes it highly relevant for the modern Christian. I would also recommend this book for those outside of or on the fringes of Christianity who are trying to understand this central aspect of Christianity."},{"Title":"THE KILLING: meditations on the death of Christ","review":"It is my opinion that a study of the Bible is not complete until you have watched Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (1977). the reason is that when we read the Bible (especially with hindsight of who is considered good or bad) it is easy to see less than the whole picture. The mood for this book \\"The Killing\\" is set by a line from Peter in \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\" After the crucifixion, the apostles are hiding from the religious authorities. Peter says: \\"We accused Judas of being a traitor, but the truth is we all betrayed him. At least our brothers in the San Hedrin who crucified him din't know him. The Romans, they did not know him.\\"As Christians today, it is easy to place these events in the past. Well Richard Holloway says otherwise. In the 1st half of the book, he explains that Peter, Judas, Pilate, and Caiaphas were 3d human beings. Amongst other things, Peter is often knocked for denying Christ 3 times. Well, anyone in his position would have been frightened. Judas is knocked for betraying Christ. While no unanimous opinion as to why prevails, Holloway suspects it may be that Judas was expecting Jesus as predicted in the OT) to put an end to the Roman occupation of Israel. Why not? Not only was it predicted in the OT, but the OT is full of stories of God freeing the Jews from their enemies. By betraying Jesus, Judas mayhave felt he was forcing God's hand to act.Caiaphas is often despised as the man who handed Jesus over to the Romans. Well, if we wish to understand, Jesus called himself the son of God, and as the high priest, Caiaphas had to react to that. Pilate is often disliked for consenting to the crucifixion. Well, Pilate did not want to do this. he tried to save Jesus, but it was Pilate's duty to keep a certain order, and he feared uprising and riots if he did not consent to the demand of the multitude.Holloway's next step is to explain to some extent we ALL have some traits of the people we often see as villains in the Gospels. (To be sure, most of us find it in our heart to forgive Peter, but he is often more popular for denying Christ than any of his good deeds.)We are all frightened to say the truth sometimes; we all try to manipulate people for our own purposes; we all make decisions under pressure that are not so benevolent; we all make wrong decisions to keep peace sometimes. Even the Romans who nailed Jesus to the cross were hired men. How often have we heard ourselves say: \\"I was just doing my job?\\"later, Holloway gives some time to the different things Jesus said as he was dying on the cross. While this is a short book (75 pages), it is really profound. not only does it explain that the characters in the Bible were 3d human beings, but it also explains that we are ALL often guilty of the things we condemn them for. If you can not find this book, I would suggest you watch \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (1977). this movie shows that characters we tend to label as good or bad, were in fact 3d human beings."},{"Title":"Maggie's Hope","review":"Maggie's Hope is a great summer read, specially on the beach!

She suffers heart aches that any mother can relate deeply to and in her decision making you can always empathize with her struggles to act with strong morality in the face of easier and less demanding courses of action. As most good mothers do, she places her childrens' needs ahead of her own desires but never loses track of who she is and what she ultimately aspires to. I cried with Maggie, was righteously angry with her, and worried along with her childrens'and friends' misfortunes. The action and multiple romances of Mrs. Abrahamson's novel kept me turning pages rapidly because she fleshed out the characters so well that I deeply cared to know each event's conclusion. With class and authenticity, the characters tumble through coal miner strikes, rum running secret rendavous, twilight romance meetings, deaths, alcohlic and physically abusive family lives, sexually pervse attractions, snobbery, and surprise fortunes.

Among other things General Semantics focuses on the fact that what we perceive to be fact and reality is only a portion or one aspect of true reality. By opening your understanding to more fully grasp all of reality it opens the doors to deeper understanding, happiness and better communication in all areas of life.At several points the authors refer to \\"Science and Sanity\\" by Korzibsky. This was the first authoritative text on General Semantics but was written in a very technical style that most people would find very difficult to follow and digest. All the major points of Korzibsky's work are included here in a much more readable style that allows the reader not only to understand the concepts but to actually start applying them right away.An excellent book for those who are interested in bettering their communication with others, NLP students and other communication professionals, as well as those interested in General Semantics, it is a recommended read."},{"Title":"Drive Yourself Sane : Using the Uncommon Sense of General Semantics, Revised Second Edition","review":"This is an excellent introduction and explanation of Korzybski's work, and I recommend it to both newcomers and experts alike. Alfred Korzybski was one of the unacknowledged geniuses of the twentieth century. He influenced a host of other thinkers and writers, among them Buckminster Fuller, Robert Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard. Korzybski's great work, &quot;Science and Sanity&quot; (1933), can be a difficult book. I thus I tried to get this book, &quot;Drive Yourself Sane,&quot; but the at that time it was out of print. I was forced to tackle &quot;Science and Sanity&quot; alone. I had to read it three times through over a period of several years. I wish I'd had &quot;Drive Yourself Sane&quot; to help me through some of the rough spots. It is well organized, nicely laid out, and has a valuable glossary in the back. It also includes valuable personal accounts from the authors. However, even an expert can gain knowledge from this book. I found that it filled in gaps in my knowledge of the subject (general semantics), gave me some new insights, and told me what others had been doing in the field since 1933. Regardless of whether you are interested in Korzybski or not, you won't finish this book without a little IQ rise."},{"Title":"Drive Yourself Sane : Using the Uncommon Sense of General Semantics, Revised Second Edition","review":"Having followed NLP training (up to Trainer's Level) I have tried for years to live the expression &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;. NLPers (including myself) often use this expression from Korzibsky methophorically to indicate that what we are saying or percieving is only a part of reality. Much of NLP as a field (as well as of my book on emotional intelligence) has to do with taking apart our &quot;subjective experience&quot; and trying to avoid mixing up what we think (our interpretation) with &quot;hard facts&quot;.NLP borrows some of its ideas in this area from a field known as &quot;general semantics&quot; and points to Korzibsky and his writings. But there is a &quot;small&quot; problem&quot;: most people I've met find &quot;Science and Sananity&quot;, Korzibsky's main book, &quot;quite challenging&quot; to read (to say the least).For me, the authors of this book have succeeded to render the ideas of General Semantics more accessible. What I appreciated especially was that this book does more than explaining Korzibsky's concepts: it also makes them usable as a tool to formulate what you want to say, so that you prevent being misunderstood (in stead of having to catch up after that people have misunderstood you).Whether you have had NLP training or not, if you want to communicate in a way that helps to avoid misunderstanding, this book may be a welcome source for help!Patrick E.C.

Further both served as senior editors of the \\"General Semantics Bulletin\\".Our daily functioning depends upon notions comprising of personal, collective, etc., experiences, perhaps involving some level of scientific understanding, but organized by Aristotle's (c. 350 B.C.) 'logic', which has an equivalence to a cultural 'common sense' forming a world view (paradigm). However when we evaluate using such mis-information, this leads to mis-perceivings, resulting in inappropriate, inflexible, functionings, etc., hence appearing maladjusted. Further that we do not question our false assumptions remains apart of the 'common sense' notions, that we are not aware as to how language affects our evaluating (event(s)-insight-logic), 'filtering' our perceivings. For example, Benjamin Whorf (1956) while an insurance investigator, had (re-)discovered (Korzybski, 1933) that, such 'unconscious' language 'habibts' can lead to accidents: people often smoked carelessly around 'empty' (filled with vapour) gaseoline drums.Such that an uncommon sense, must involve an extensional (factual evaluating) orientation, thus scientific, as 'opposed' to 'conditioned' 'aristotelian metaphysical-logical' 'deductions'. That our premises (theories, guesses, etc) lead to consequences, as poorly developed forms of Mathematical-logic, first became noticed by Cassius J. Keyser (1922) as \\"Logical Fate\\". So that it appeared clear that if we can apply a mathematical framework, making our premises extensionally conscious, then we might function more adjusted, adaptively, (sanely), etc.; since different premises leads to different consequences, we must revise them inductively.Where Alfred Korzybski's (1933) General Semantics (Science of values, hence evaluating), addresses these along with many other problems.Whereas this book represents an excellent primer for General Semantics."},{"Title":"County Tipperary One Hundred Years Ago: A Guide and Directory, 1889","review":"This book is a combination of a postal directory of County Tipperary,Ireland in 1889 and local history. The book was originally published as &quot;A manual and directory for manufacturers,merchants,traders,professional men,land-owners,farmers,tourists, anglers and sportsmen generally&quot;.Approximately half of the book consists of pictures and advertisements from businesses. The remainder of the book is divided between a postal directory of 1889 and local and county history. There is an overall index for merchants,but &quot;Farmers &amp; Residents&quot; must be looked up at their postal directory listing. This book is of great interest for the genealogist looking for anyone circa 1889 in Tipperary. The directory also can give a person an idea of the number of individuals of a particular surname that stayed behind in post-famine Ireland. The listing of names appears to be comprehensive for any person that owned or leased land in Tipperary. Persons living in a hotel or working as a laborer for others on a farm may not be listed. I was able to locate all of my many ancestors (head of houshold) who lived in Tipperary at this time. In one case I found an ancestor whose postal address was different than his acutal Townsland address.

Or for that matter psychological, philisophical or religious. Nash's poetry, written from the early 20's to the late 50's is remark on the social niceties. A critique of the love-hate relationship of men and women. A funny peek into the lives of animals. And silly stories for the sake of being silly. The uniqueness in Nash's work is not the poetry itself, but his play with words. Its clear he does not take language seriously at all which allows him to mix and maneuver words to create new ones that will create a genuine laugh. Such as: &quot;Well I have learned that life is something about which you can't conclude anything except that it is full of vicissitudes. And when you expect logic you only come across eccentricitudes.&quot; The other aspect of Nash's writing is his outlaw verse where, although things rhyme, the rythm is thown askew.&quot;I know that a year has rolled around once moreWhen I find myself thumbing a crisp new cigarette lighter just like the coven of other cigarette lighters strewn on a shelf in the garage along with the broken tire chains and the license plates for 1934.&quot;Nash's work was surely ahead of its time and I am dleighted to have come across such remarkable work.

It contains essays by such big names in philosophy as J&uuml;rgen Habermas, Charles Taylor, Richard Rorty, Ian Hacking, Edward Said, and Hubert Dreyfus, as well as by such big names in Foucauldian scholarship as Arnold Davidson and Paul Rabinow (along with Dreyfus). These essays are all generally respectful in tone, but some are of a highly critical nature (those of Charles Taylor and Habermas, especially) while others are of an interpretive nature (those of Arnold Davidson, Richard Rorty, Dreyfus/Rabinow, Ian Hacking). Most of these essays are of very fine quality, and even ones with which I do not agree (like that of Charles Taylor) are still extremely interesting and valuable, perhaps for that very reason.I've read a great deal of Foucault as well as secondary literature about him, and I would go so far as to say that this is the best critical volume available, if you are looking for a nice array (from positive to negative) of philosophically important perspectives. The CAMBRIDGE COMPANION TO FOUCAULT is valuable as a collection of scholarly essays concerning Foucault, but this FOUCAULT: A CRITICAL READER provides a completely different realm of discussion by incorporating a sense of active philosophical dialogue where Foucault is not necessarily the central participant. That is not to say that Foucault is not the subject of these essays, as they run the gamut from analysis of his early work on madness, to his middle quasi-structuralist work, to his later work on ethics. But, the thought contained in these essays are not always confined within the realm of thought Foucault opened up and actively confront pragmatic and philosophical problems with his workThe essay by Dreyfus and Rabinow is particularly fine as an interpretation of Foucault's oeuvre. Their book, MICHEL FOUCAULT: BEYOND STRUCTURALISM AND HERMENEUTICS, is still the standard text for a philosophically rigorous interpretation of Foucault. This essay seems to update the reading they provided in that text and is very engaging.Another great feature of this collection is that many of the essays cite the others or at least the authors of the others, so one gets the sense of a superb discussion. The essays by Arnold Davidson and Richard Rorty have conflicting interpretations about the coherency of Foucault's oeuvre, the former viewing archaeology and genealogy as companion methods (as Foucault did...most of the time...) and the latter viewing archaeology as a failed project then replaced by a more philosophically coherent project of genealogy. More directly, Rorty's essay is a response to a lecture given by Ian Hacking, a lecture which is one of the two items by Hacking published in this collection. Almost every author (to my recollection) cites Dreyfus and Rabinow, and some speak about the Habermas/Foucault debate-that-never-was, while Habermas himself includes a short article partially (but only partially) summarizing his criticisms of Foucault in his very engaging THE PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE OF MODERNITY.For anyone interested in Foucault in any significant way or for those interested in the takes of any of these thinkers on Foucault, this volume is a must."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"The Rights of Man is a riposte to Edmund Burke's criticism of the French Revolution. Its message is the superiority of reason, in the form of Republican government armed with the Declaration of the Rights of Man, over despotism which holds populations in ignorance. With the American and French revolutions fresh in his mind, Paine was writing in a world on the threshold of freedom and that comes through in his forceful and forthright style. That said, and most important for the reader to appreciate, much of what he has to say still applies today. Paine in scathing in his critique of hereditary monarchy and privilege. He says &quot;the idea of hereditary legislation is.......as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man.&quot; He rejects the notion of government laws being justified by tradition and therefore irrevocable. His argument against Burke's defence of the 1688 revolution in England is perhaps the best in the book. Paine argues that the only thing that is truly hereditary is the Rights of Man : &quot;The Rights of men in society, are neither devisable, nor transferrable, nor annihilable, but descendable only.&quot; The book is a superb polemic when both understood in its historical context and applied to world politics today. His arguments for reform of the House of Lords strike a particularly pertinent note. He expresses liberal doctrines that many people take for granted but in our own genocidal times Paine reminds us that many of the topics that impassioned him should continue to impassion everyone with an interest in humanity. The style of the writing may put off a few as many themes disappear and reappear throughout the book instead of being dealt with in a coherant whole. The fact that it was written in two parts and that he is one of the greatest pamphleteers of modern times should compensate for this minor irritation."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"Thomas Paine's &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"\\"Rights of Man\\" (1791-92) is Thomas Paine's famous response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution of France\\" (1790). Although it helps have read Burke's essay, a general background is sufficient to understand and appreciate Paine's basic and groundbreaking arguments.Paine and Burke were originally allies; Burke not only supported self-rule for the American colonies, he also supported the emancipation of the House of Commons from monarchical control and the independence of both Ireland and India. Many of his allies, then, were bewildered by his fervent opposition to the French Revolution; Burke drew the line between territorial autonomy from a distant or aloof government and the total overthrow of existing monarchies and institutions. For Burke, humankind's real enemies were drastic change and \\"unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos,\\" and he proved himself a staunch defender of the status quo, of precedent, and of gradual reform.Jerry Muller, in his recent--and superb--book \\"The Mind and the Market\\" asserts that Burke's denunciation of the French revolution is \\"the single most influential work of conservative thought published from his day to ours.\\" (This, of course, depends on what one means by \\"conservative.\\") Yet Muller and likeminded historians inevitably cherry-pick Burke's more attractive economic and philosophical arguments and foreground Burke's critique, in Muller's words, \\"of the revolutionary mentality that attempts to create entirely new structures on the basis of rational, abstract principles.\\" (Muller doesn't even mention Paine, much less the example of the United States.) Such a focus inevitably sidesteps Burke's brief for the supremacy of European monarchical institutions and of the landed aristocracy. And that's where Paine comes in.With his usual acerbic wit and extravagant rhetoric, Paine, in the first part of his treatise, makes mincemeat out of Burke's sillier statements. For example, he finds especially unspeakable Burke's claim that that \\"the English nation did, at the time of the [1688] Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate [the right of self-rule], for themselves, and for all their posterity for ever.\\" Paine correctly challenges the primacy of a decision made by members of that generation over desires of other generations, questions the right of any generation to surrender the rights of their descendants, and notes that \\"government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it.\\"He also chastises the English for a system of hereditary government that virtually guarantees unfettered rule by children, madmen, idiots, and foreign-born pretenders (and he certainly has plenty of examples from which to choose), many of whom led their realms into chaos and terror without the help of radical revolutionaries. And Paine argues that wars would cease with the promotion of democracy and the cessation of the selfish interests of absolutists. His critics rightly respond that the rise of democratic institutions has hardly stopped wars, although one might pose the counterargument that, relatively speaking, democratic governments go to war with each other much less frequently.In the second part, Paine proposes a radical agenda for an overhaul of the British government. Although his anecdotally based statistics and figures must be viewed with skepticism and a few laughs, the prescience of his proposals is startling: poverty relief, social security, public education, maternity care, homeless shelters, workfare, veteran's benefits, and progressive taxation. His is the agenda of the idealist: \\"When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive . . . when these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and its government.\\"Paine, of course, had the nascent United States to cite in support of his proposals, but he and Burke were debating these matters before the onset of the Jacobin Reign of Terror, which dismayed Paine and seems to have realized Burke's worst fears. Yet, throughout history, for every Robespierre or Lenin, one can find a Mandela or a Walesa; monarchies too were no strangers to upheaval. Paine hardly argued for \\"mob rule\\" or even \\"majority rule\\"; the French Revolution failed in part because it violated the fundamental tenet that the citizens of each nation have a right to choose whatever rule they please, even \\"a bad or defective government, . . . so long as the majority to not impose conditions on the minority, different to what they impose on themselves\\"--a caveat we all should take to heart in today's political climate."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"Paine wrote RoM while in France, during the early years of the revolution, in response to an antirevolutionary pamphlet from his previous friend Burke. There is lots of polemics going on, and the crux of the matter is that Burke makes light of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, which was adopted by the French National Assembly in August 1789, after the storm of the Bastille. The Declaration, written by Lafayette with some input by Jefferson, is a brief and concise document. It became the preamble of the constitution of 1791.Here a shortened version.1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the ... rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. ...4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; ... These limits can only be determined by law.5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. ...7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. ...8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.9. ...all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty ...10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be intrusted.13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their means.14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of the taxes.15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his administration.16. A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all.17. ... property is an inviolable and sacred right ...Paine contrasts this brilliantly utopian text with England's lack of a constitution.But there is not just the matter of principle, there is also disagreement over matters of fact.Burke had denied not only the French right to revolt, but also the reason to revolt, as the current holder of the throne was not known to be a despot. Paine's point is that the revolution was not against the king as a person, but against a despotic system, which divided and sub-divided in 1000 steps and acted by deputation. Popper's concept of the \`open society' comes to mind. The \`declaration' quoted above aims at an open society. That is not a question of the personal quality of an individual ruler.(I can't help thinking laterally, about a special country, which right now also has a reasonably mild and rational government, within the limits of the system... What is the leader of the revolution over here quoted as having said when asked about the French Revolution? It is too early to tell. Well, that seems to be apocryphal.)Government, wrote Paine, arises out of 3 sources:a)superstition (priest craft, think of Islamic or other religious states),b)power (dictatorships, one party rules), orc)reason (which i.m.o. is synonym with secular).Unfortunately we know from history that many cases which started out from reason went into some kind of hybrid state, down the road.

Read what he has to say for yourself and make your own judgements.This work is rather amazing when you consider the date that he penned these masterpieces. Don't pay any attention to the right-wing attempts at slurring Tom even today. He made sense in 1776 and his arguments makes sense today. If there were no Tom Paine I doubt if their would be an independent United States today - even George Washington admitted that fact.

He listens to this over and over again. Thanks so much."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"The book is a response to arguments made by Edmond Burke that were critical to the constitution and behavior that resulted from the French revolution. Edmond Burke believed in the English constitution and the structure of the government in Great Britain. Mr. Paine argued the British did not have a constitution, the government was tyrannical, not efficient, a poor economic system, and not democratic. The sporadic alterations in the general design of the English government was not designed by the people voted on by the population in Great Britain, so it cannot be considered a constitution. The purpose of this work is to make an argument why the constitution set up by the French revolution is superior to the pre-Revolutionary French government and the current British government at the time of publication. No constitution cannot be established but through referendum.Thomas Paine argues that the equality of man is established by his very nature. His arguments come from the bible and other religious resources. The rationale for the rights from man come from God, but the author does not believe an individual religion has a monopoly on the truth. Pain believed in freedom of association and the organization of individuals in the making a political argument. He believed people of opposing thoughts could come to accommodation while they walked this earth. Anyhow he believed in the arguments of different world views could be made to come to the conclusion all men equal in his natural state.Paine argued government is formed either through Superstition (Religious manipulation) Power (war, conquering a people) and those that arise out of society (constitutional government). Constitution must occur before the government. The United States and France were his examples of governments coming from society. Governments that exist out of power or superstition produce a hereditary government or government ruled by a certain association not from the population or society. Edmond Burke defended the nobility. Mr. Paine made a distinction between government privileges inherited based on birth and the wealth obtained through inheritance. Titles are nicknames of legal sanction to have authority over others in the population. Consequence is not just unfairness, but a less competent government and the lack of fairness in governmental decisions. Distinction between people must be determined by the person's utility. Does the person improve society by holding a specific position of trust. The sovereign and legislators should be determined by the vote. Transmission of ideas through debate will improve the government. Debate is formed through association. People should be encouraged form into groups in order to form alliance to their point across. Society and Civilization, the wants of the people can be pursued more efficiently when a structure exists where ideas may be debated, thoughts learned, and more may seek participation. Some men have abilities that other do not posses. Society therefore the individual function better under structure but that does not mean all governments are equally as effective. Thomas Paine did not want the rights of a select few chosen through heredity protected at the expense of others. Men seek a fair government where their concerns are heard.Thomas Paine believed in the Universal Right of Conscience. Man does not worship man, but God. The mortal worships the immortal. Government should not presume or regulate how man worships the immortal neither should government define who the immortal is. - If man is free to judge his own faith his beliefs will hold what is to be true. - If man is free to judge another's faith he will hold or believe the idea of another God to be false. Thomas Pain makes the argument government corrupts religion. I have no argument here. But when he argues that government is the cause of religious intolerance that argument is absurd.The author saw the forces of history on the side democracy. Thomas Paine saw democracy as a major factor in developing the free enterprise system. He saw the United State as a major example of democracy and prosperity. Man was set free to go after wealth in so doing creating more wealth. He presumed France would soon follow the United States. Thomas Paine argued government sanctioned Charters (monopolies for the Aristocrats ) hindering ingenuity and the betterment of man. The more efficient the trade between people and nations the more wealth is produced.The author goes into great length to argue for less regressive taxes. Taxes on products hit the poor the hardest and increase the need for more in the population to receive aid to be able to survive. Thomas Paine was an advocate of a more progressive tax. He also argued for more government to those in aid by taking returns of investments and taxes on the wealthy.."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"This book was written in 1790 and 91. It was written in two parts. It started out as a rebuttal to Edmund Burke's book on the French Revolution, but as it developed Paine ended up discussing the whole aspect of democracy and goes in quite detail into the ills of a monarchial government. Paine was an ex-patriot Englishman who lived for a time in the United States. His time there coincided with the American Revolution, and Paine was a contemporary of George Washington and Ben Franklin. Paine was an idealist and that comes out clear in this important work. He also made a lot of enemies in England with his radical viewpoints. His was not an easy life, but he certainly lived at a crucial time in world history, and his viewpoints are actually quite valid in some respects even today. Not an easy book to read, but an important work to make the effort to do so."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"How far the mighty fall.Paine refuses to condemn even the most hideous atrocities of the French Revolution, and indeed, imagines that other countries should applaud and emulate them. As if \\"FREEDOM\\" meant \\"freedom to live in terror of the Paris mob,\\" or indeed, \\"freedom to participate in the random, vicious slaughter of innocents ALONGSIDE the Paris mob.\\" But in this book, there is no such thing as an \\"innocent\\" aristocrat. The aristocracy concept itself is oppressive, and must be rooted out through violence in pursuit of a \\"pure\\" France of poverty, random dismemberment, starvation, and despair.In this book, Paine considers ALL the authority of the past illegitimate -- all of it. All structures from family to piety to duty to honor must fall ... supposedly because it is \\"enlightened\\" to think so. Paine thinks the only thing holding people back from becoming truly transcendant beings (heaven on earth again) is those moldy old conventions. If this sounds like Pol Pot and Mao and today's \\"pragmatic\\" politicians, it's because revolutionaries from that age to this have borrowed these words in pursuit of their true goal: POWER. They've also borrowed the methods of the French Revolution -- terrorizing their own people and destroying their own nations.SO, my big question is this: Is it because of Paine that Jefferson failed to comprehend the evil of the French Revolution?How could Paine, who championed the American Revolution (a war to UPHOLD the long-standing British principles of natural rights and common laws, which were being violated by the Colonial governors) have written this book so soon on the heels? Was Paine secretly paid by the National Assembly to produce this? Did he instead revel in misery and bloodshed, was he a real sicko? One must wonder.The person to read on the French Revolution is Governeur Morris, the American minister to France after Jefferson's stint there -- his journals reflect the reality on the ground, and he roundly conveys his disgust.Gentleman Revolutionary: Gouverneur Morris, the Rake Who Wrote the ConstitutionEnvoy to the Terror: Gouverneur Morris and the French Revolution"},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"On time, and as promised.

It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL \\"democratic\\" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow."},{"Title":"Rights of man: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French Revolution (The thinker's library)","review":"This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.

Regardless, the second part, the chapter on &quot;Ways and Means&quot; in particular, is composed of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find. What Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state, replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other fine statist amenities. Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever. It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty. In truth, he is actually one of its worst enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression, revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy."},{"Title":"Beyond The Lingo","review":"This is am impressive first book, a great achievement.

The author also does not hesitate to include some philosophical argumentation wherever needed. It is written for the advanced undergraduate, and will prepare such a reader for more advanced reading in the subject.The first chapter of the book is the best, for it is a comprehensive discussion of the origins of the theory of relativity as one that rejected the assertion that space and time were absolute. The author also gives an interesting historical discussion of Lorentz's ether theory, wherein Lorentz hypothesized that bodies moving through the ether undergo a contraction, and he discovered a time transformation that implied that clocks moving through the ether run slow. As the author points out, Lorentz thought such considerations were purely mathematical, and not important physically. In addition, in the section on Mach's principle, the author discusses briefly the work of Dennis Sciama who showed that the 1872 gravitational theory of F. Tisserand included Mach's principle. I was not aware of this work, and it motivated me to do further reading on the subject. The author also gives several examples to show that Mach's principle is not physically vacuous, but has observational consequences.Chapter two overviews the kinematic consequences of the special theory of relativity. The most interesting part of this discussion was the section on the formulation of special relativity without assuming the invariance of the speed of light. The author shows that the principle of relativity implies that either all inertial frames are related by Galilean transformations, or all are related by Lorentz transformations with the same (postive) velocity (squared).A discussion of optical effects follows in chapter 3. One unexpected and interesting result in this chapter is that a moving sphere has a circular outline to all observers because of length contraction.Some of the mathematical formalism needed in special relativity is overviewed in chapter four. The class of four-vectors and four-tensors is defined, and the light cone geometry discussed in detail.The relativistic mechanics of point particles is covered in chapter five. Such a theory is cast in the language of four-vectors, and the author explains nicely the mass-energy equivalence, analyzes scattering from a relativistic standpoint in the center of momentum frame, and shows how Newtonian mechanics is altered in the relativistic realm. He also spends a little time on relativistic continuum mechanics, via the energy tensor of the simplest continua: dust.The connection between relativity and electrodynamics is outlined in chapter six. The material is standard and found in most books on relativity.The author begins the study of general relativity in chapter seven with some elementary considerations of the differential geometry of curved surfaces and also Riemannian spaces. The author endeavors, rightfully, to explain the mathematics in a way that is intuitive as possible, rather than hitting the reader with highly abstract formalism.He then presents the mathematica foundations of general relativity in chapter eight. After a brief review of tensor calculus, the author considers the gravitational field equations in a vacuum, emphasizing their nonlinearity. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the famous Schwarzschild solution. In addition, he considers a particular exact solution of the Einstein field equations in a vacuum, namely a plane-fronted gravitational wave. Although not physical, this solution illustrates some important properties of general gravitational radiation.The author ends the book with a fairly detailed overview of cosmology. The difficulties in the pre-relativistic cosmology are discussed, one of the more interesting being the consideration of the Newtonian gravitational field inside a cavity resulting from the removal of a finite sphere from a static universe. Recognizing that Poisson's equation does not have a constant solution led to the alteration of the Newtonian potential and thus a modification of the Poisson equation. As the author observes, this move to get a static Newtonian universe is formally the same as what Einstein did via the introduction of the cosmological constant in his field equations (also to get a static universe). The author also considers the Robertson-Walker, Milne, and Friedman universe, and compares these to what is known observationally."},{"Title":"Essential Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological","review":"Although not the most comprehesive text onthe subject (see Thorne's tome, Gravitation),Essential Relativity is perhaps the mostfulfilling book from which to learn both special and general relativity on a graduate school level.Flipping through the pages, one cannot helpbut notice that it often reads like a novel.For the student or the adventurous, a widevariety of problems are found in an appendix.The author's background in differential geometryis very evident in his excellent explanationsof difficult concepts."},{"Title":"Essential Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological","review":"This is a good book to learn the basic concepts behind relativity beyond the popular science books. It is a mid-level text aimed at an audience familiar with mathematics/physics but less inclined to go through something more comprehensive like Weinberg. Its value is largely in its discussion rather than rigorous derivations and proofs. In fact, it is quite lacking in the mathematical discussion (results occasionally show up with little introduction or explanation). What popular science tries to convey via hand waving and the advanced texts ignore (due to their \\"philosophical rather than scientific relevance\\"), this book attempts to correctly explain. Examples would be discussions regarding inertial frames, Mach's principle, and the general physical/philosophical/practical implications of seemingly \\"benign\\" results.I would not recommend this book to learn general relativity (as opposed to special relativity), however. It glosses over several mathematical preliminaries, especially those of tensor calculus. Once the concepts and strategies are understood, the best way to learn general relativity is directly via tensor calculus. Lawden's concise book in this case (Introduction to Tensor Calculus, Relativity and Cosmology) is undoubtedly one of the best investments to make in this regard. Otherwise, Weinberg is, as mentioned previously, the veritable bible of relativity and related cosmology but is not definitely not something to read sitting in front of the fireplace.Also be warned, the hardcover copy is of quite poor quality. The pages seem low grade recycled (nothing wrong with that though) and the print is blurry (not crisp)."},{"Title":"Essential Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological","review":"This is a wonderful book, very amusing and thought provoking.

It happens at some point to all of us. Compton-Burnett is an unusual writer, true. She is not a \\"realist\\". \\"Do people really speak this way?\\" he asks. Strangely enough, there are no actual people inside the covers of this book - only characters. And characters in literature speak any damned way the author pleases. Did King Henry IV speak in verse? This may not be one of Ivy's top five (I particularly recommend \\"Manservant and Maidservant\\"), yet it is still quite distinctive and enjoyable. But it's a highly literary fantasy/satire. If you enjoy Peacock, Firbank, Beerbohm or Schuyler, this is your cup of tea. \\"Germinal\\" it's not."},{"Title":"A Family and a Fortune","review":"&quot;The rich are different from us,&quot; Scott Fitzgerald is reputed to have once said to Ernest Hemingway -- to which the celebrated Nobel Prizewinning author is said to have (obviously with tongue in cheek) replied: &quot;Yes, they have more money.&quot; Now whether Hemingway was speaking in a kind of jest, or whether the whole thing, like Oscar Wilde's declaration of his genius at the New York Customs House, was apocryphal, we will never know for sure; yet the point is well taken.The rich ARE different. But only in an economic sense. Human nature remains human nature. And it seems the novelist's job is to illuminate the conundrums of the human condition for the reader. So why do Compton-Burnett's characters speak in what is best described as an almost inscrutable language? Yes, the characters in her novels are quite different, but it's difficult to believe people do or have ever spoken like this; it's difficult for the reader to identify with or sympathize over characters such as these being portrayed here. It's a Jacobean or a Herculean struggle for the reader to read this odd, quirky, mostly dialog-laden prose of this strange, albeit unique writer.So to any reader comptemplating dipping into this author's almost impregnable prose, unless doing it out of an academic exercise or personal sense of obligation, I would issue a strong caveat -- be advised: don't. Not unless you're the masochistic type or the type who enjoys the monumental struggle of trying to ferret out meaning from virtually every sentence, having to read twice or thrice, so much so, that quite often the reader is left adrift in a sea of uncertainty as to where he or she is in the course of the story; you'd be well-advised to pass this up.Still, I am aware that there are reviewers, readers and critics who swear by this author, as being an acute observer of the human condition. Fair enough. But what I would want is to read an author who does not take language and twist and bend it into an instrument of his or her own choosing and give it an almost alien life to that found in this one in which we live. To those who find meaning in her works for them, I say fine, and best of luck. This reviewer doesn't. For communication should be of more substance than merely the esoteric. It should speak to all.Nevertheless, there are artists who are considered great and are virtually laden with layers of interpretation and enigma, providing commentators and scholars with plenty of work to last some of them -- and us -- a lifetime: Joyce, Faulkner, Proust, Picasso, and on and on.Let there be no mistake: I am not a stranger to difficult writers, having worked my way through a good portion of them. Start with the works of Shakespeare and go on to that of Faulkner, Henry James (with the exception of WHAT MASIE KNEW, which is one of those books James wrote, like the writer under discussion, which seems to be a kind of closet drama and an insoluble puzzle) and Joyce's ULYSSES, the latter twice and well understood. Even Thomas Pynchon in our own time, who is quite a challenge; even he yields much pleasure, much wit. Never, I say, had I had the kind of comprehension struggle with those mentioned, and even boredom I had with Compton-Burnett. Besides, I have been through a great deal of 18th and 19th century British literature; yet never have I encountered the kind of resistance I get with this author.A FAMILY AND A FORTUNE is the kind of novel one rejoices in seeing come to a merciful conclusion. I think perhaps a large part of the problem rests more with the reader than the writer. Perhaps. For I suspect this is a woman's book, with a woman's perspective and a woman's sensibility. Consider, for example, this kind of sentence:&quot;Oh, don't let us joke about it. Do let us turn serious eyes on a serious human situation.&quot;Oh. Do people really speak this way? Even English people of the upper classes? I'm not persuaded. Why not say something like this: &quot;Oh, let's not be funny, but do be serious about this.&quot; There are oh so many other examples of this kind of thing that could have been cited. But I'll spare the reader further examples.This reviewer has been visiting the U.K. for over a fifteen-year period in summers and has never had the kind of epic struggle in understanding them (except in Scotland) that I find here.Again, I cannot recommend this author to most readers who read for pleasure, which, after all, is the goal of almost any book that purports to be published to be read. The other kind is the kind that the writer writes for the writer's own benefit. In other words, a self-indulgent undertaking. But its author is gone, and like the Faulkners, the Jameses, et al. of this world, will never return to remedy and make clear what, in many respects, should have been made clear for the reader in its original incarnation. The only reason I embarked on this arduous struggle is the fact that I had a professor -- highly regarded and respected in his time in matters of taste and subtlety -- who mentioned this in the context of a lecture on MACBETH. In short, I wish he hadn't."},{"Title":"A Journey in the Human Dilemma","review":"This book of poems displays the roots of Hendricks' &quot;political satirist&quot; writings. His poems reflect a solid grounding in an awareness of the rhythms of the universe. A keen observer of the natural environment, he shows us how far humanity has strayed from its connection to the natural world that sustains us.His rational mind does not presume to prophesy, rather *project* where our separation from Nature may take us. While many of the poems may not be considered lyrical, his reading of those that are not, become so in the reading.Not all poets read their own work well. Anthony is one who reads his poems as he wishes them to be heard. It is a pity all readers of his poems cannot have a personal reading."},{"Title":"Silva Method Ultra CD/DVD Set (3 CD's and 1 DVD)","review":"I've been a Silva student for years -- this package (and the course) expands on the Basic Series.

Another great book to go with it would be the excellent work of Flintlock Fowlers by Tom Grinslade. Its own section on Colonial fowlers though good would be well augmented. It also provides insights into some of the fighting men of the period. It certainly could use a little work on the French section as well as German but none the less is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Muskets of the Revolution and the French & Indian Wars","review":"It would have been a much better book with color illustrations and comparison photos of different locks close together, but it is still a very good book on this subject and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Muskets of the Revolution and the French & Indian Wars","review":"\\"The exciting, true story of the guns that fought the American Revolution, including intimate details of the men who carried them and the desperate battles in which they served.

The author chose many muskets to describe where the piece could be traced to a unit or sometimes an individual. The battles that these units fought in are briefly described and are traced to the likelyhood of the place of their use or possible capture, due to where the muskets were found or purchased, or the date that units were captured or left campaigning. This illustrations would have been nice in color, but this is not neccesary. What I like is the fact that each musket chosen for inclusion comes with a story. I have had enough of books that give all of the statistics, but tell you nothing of the history of the weapons pictured. To know the likely history of each piece is fascinating. I have several weapons that have a story to tell, but no markings let me know where they were or who used them.

My maps always look pristine on the first day, by the time I have arrived at my final destination the maps are beyond redemption, often consisting of segments and various pieces. This map holds up! The Rough Guide Maps are \\"Rip-Proof\\" & Waterproof because they are printed on a high grade sheet of plastic (kudos). Because of the plastic fabric it is easier to fold than paper maps.The roads (expressway, highway, secondary and other) are cleanly printed and in sharp detail making reading this map a breeze. The coloring and shading used allows for a good decimation of physical features, such as mountain ranges, valleys and peaks (Altitude noted).

Great way to understand the Christian heritage of Hawaii."},{"Title":"Grapes of Canaan: Hawaii 1820: The True Story of Hawaii's Missionaries","review":"One of the best books I've read on the Missionary era in Hawaii, newly republished by the Mission Houses Museum, Honolulu, Albertine Loomis' Grapes of Caanan shows how the Islands' society was rapidly changing and disintegrating after a civil war and the end of the onerous tabu system. Into this chaos came New England missionaries, peddling a stern form of Christianity but a gentle, dedicated care for the Hawaiian people. Their individual sorrows and struggles, especially but not exclusively difficult for the women, draw readers into the core of their efforts. This was heightened by resistance from Western traders already established on the Islands who wanted nothing better than to remove resources, especially sandalwood, and undermine the native culture through alcohol and promiscuity. The native people themselves often had trouble deciding which Westerners to trust, but eventually many of their leaders fell in love with reading, which the missionaries thoroughly supported. Perhaps more than any other gifts to the Islands, the missionaries offered reading in the Hawaiian language and guidance in political resistance to Western powers and traders who wanted to co-opt the native government. A bit too much business history for my taste; otherwise a page-turner."},{"Title":"Grapes of Canaan: Hawaii 1820: The True Story of Hawaii's Missionaries","review":"This is an excellent, well written book covering the history of missions in Hawaii. It deals with the trials and triumphs of the haoles as they came to bring Christ to the island."},{"Title":"The Sistine Chapel","review":"This work has every image of the Sistine Chapel represented. This work consist of two large tomes: quite heavy in their own casing: each page is quite thick and meant to last centuries. Each illustration is obviously hand pasted into the books and because of this was probably meant to be a limited addition.However, the author is not detailed in his analysis of what he is observing in the chapel, which can be quite misleading. He does not explain his approach to discussing the illustrations. For example he list all 28-popes portrayed on the North, East and South walls but he does it in an alternate manner. Listing each pope by going from the North Wall then to the South Wall in an continuous alternate manner as if walking down the length of the chapel crisscrossing the popes from the West Wall to the East Wall. This is not quite apparent when reading the texts and viewing the illustrations of the popes. In laying out the 28-individual popes Roberto Salvini does not mention that he has listed the popes in this manner so one assumes they are as they appear on the walls from the North Wall by the Last Judgment round to the South Wall by the Last Judgment. I did not discovery my false assumption for years. This taught me that one must not assume the researcher is discussing the images of the chapel in what is considered a normal manner and that one must eyeball personally the data for oneself in verifying even what one consider mundane 'common sense' data. Mr. Salvini considered the frescoes of these popes to be quite boring and uninteresting. Actually, his assumption is the furthest thing from the truth. There are many other nuances to the problem of the popes, which I will not entertain here.Otherwise I found this set of books quite refreshing in how it laid out the illustrations."},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","review":"First, as a rebuttal to shechem, I wouldn't recommend this book to an engaged couple or an angry person because this book is really for married couples who exist with this constant undercurrent of anger. Just because you have a temper doesn't mean you will have an angry marriage. Yes, the author does take a long time to make her point but it is a point well made: that we are all products of how we were raised and that that shapes our actions and attitudes. This is not a blame your parents book because if it were, I would not have read it. It simply states that our parents are our first role models for marriage. We take from them roles and responses to our own marriages. I found that the most enlightening aspect of the book was reading each couple's childhood background, which I'm sure, helped bring understanding to each of the marriages. Often, we don't know what bags our spouse is coming out of and get frustrated that he/she isn't more like ourselves.After reading the profiles of each type of angry marriage (which, to me took too long because you kind of got the picture in the 3rd or so chapter) the basic message I got is to begin to reclaim that goodwill toward your spouse that sustains you through boredom, disappontment, conflict and tragedy; that if you don't have good feelings toward your spouse, you simply will not make it. With ill will, everything a spouse does is framed negatively.Keep in mind that this is a modern day book, an extended version of advice that might be given in the &quot;Can This Marriage Be Saved?&quot; or in Redbook. No new revelations, but for a marriage that is on the wrong track, this just may help push it back."},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","review":"This is truly a must for any person committed to a long-term relationship, not just one that's presently &quot;troubled&quot; by anger and resentment. I would prescribe this book prophylactically! Of course, it is also a self help reference book in the best sense of the term. I was impressed by how skillfully Dr. Maslin's case vignettes are being put to work to illustrate the various patterns of marital discord, and to show the potential for a healthier solution. Dr. Maslin is a highly experienced psychologist who wrote this book for all people who want to become serious (again) about a marriage and continue to build it. Once you've read it thoroughly (once, or more than once), you will want to make this book a quick reference (if your best friend hasn't borrowed it!)."},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","review":"The book helped me realize several ways my anger affects my marriage and I wish I had read it before marrying. However, I wish the author had provided suggestions throughout the book as opposed to waiting until the last chapter. I found myself somewhat discouraged reading what was wrong but not having suggestions at hand."},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","review":"This is a really good book about the dynamics of anger or 'the dance of anger' as it's been expressed in other books. What it helped me to see was that my seemingly angry spouse was not the only problem in my marriage -- rather, over the years, we had evolved a difficult relationship style that we are just now starting to repair. I wasn't actively angry but I was deeply resentful -- because I usually agree with my spouse, even when I don't want to do something, because I'm so afriad of upsetting the relationship.This book also helps you to understand all these family of origin issues and how they play into the dance that you eventually evolve with your partner -- is one of you perhaps on some level avoiding getting too close to your partner? Are you both, perhaps, uncomfortable with drawing too close to another person? Perhaps you were punished in your family of origin for expressing anger? Perhaps your parents withdrew their affections when you disagreed with them.It turns out that the anger is in some ways just a symptom of some other problems -- like difficulties in trusting another person. And since the anger is merely a symptom, just treating the anger doesn't go far enough in addressing the problem. This makes this book fundamentally different from other books which purport to teach you to fight fair or control your anger. This one rather forces you to take a good hard look inside yourself to figure out WHY exactly you're angry (particularly if you're one of those repressed people who would prefer to sweep the ugly emotions under the rug) and then to deal with it. First rate."},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","review":"This Book is the best I've read on helping heal a troubled marriage. I only wish I could have a session or two with the author! I think every married couple I know should read it. Great!"},{"Title":"The Angry Marriage: Overcoming The Rage, Reclaiming the Love","review":"I bought this book because I am getting married in a year. I'm not an &quot;angry person&quot;, but I have a temper and I wanted to learn a better way of communicating.This was not the book for me. After slogging through the first 3 chapters of it, the author finally got around to stating her thesis which is, there are three parts to an angry marriage. The visible marriage, the invisible marriage (the needs that are not getting expressed) and the primal marriage. the primal marriage is the realtionship one had with their parents, which is why they are angry with thier spouse.at that point I quit reading. I personally have a problem with blaming everything on one's parents because one's parents weren't perfect. From the examples the author puts forth to support her idea aren't absuive parents, but parents that are a bit annoying. Who doesn't have a parent that doens't get under their skin once in a while? to blame that on why folks don't communicate well strikes me as silly.this book was both a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Bob, son of Battle","review":"The best dog story ever written, bar none (I'm including Lassie Come Home and The Call of the Wild). What makes it so are two things: detail and duality. The book works on two levels, with one level being a very realistically drawn portrait of the lives of the shepherds of England's Yorkshire dales, and the other being a interlocking tale of two men, one good and the other evil, and their dogs, also good and evil, respectively.What really kicks this story up a notch from the usual dog story is the depth of the good-and-evil theme, with the point being that in even the best of men there are weaknesses, and that in even the worst of men there are strengths.A thinking man's dog story, and a parable of tolerance far ahead of its time.Note: The dialogue is written in the vernacular of the place and time (late nineteenth century England), and is not always easy to wade through. It's well worth doing so, however."},{"Title":"Bob, son of Battle","review":"I've read all of the usual classic dog stories, ie, Lassie Come Home,Call of the Wild (a personal favorite), White Fang and most of the Albert Payson Terhune books (Lad, A Dog etc). As you may surmise, dogs have been a close part of my life (for over 60 years). I saw the movie (Thunder in the Valley) based on this book, Bob, Son of Battle in 1947 when it was first released. The movie struck home because of the theme which roughly paralled this book and I never forgot it. I had the book in my library as a young boy and tried to read it several times but could not wade thru or understand some of the dialect so I never finished it then. I recently obtained a copy of the book and can say that this is one of the very best novels I have read. It is more than a tale of two men and their shepherd dogs or good vs. evil. The character of Adam MacAdam is more than that of a mean (or even evil) man. The description of MacAdam as he says goodbye to his dying wife will show that. And later in life, his soliloquoy to his fellow shepherders about his loneliness, the alienation from his son, his isolation, the loss of the coveted Dalesman cup etc. gives some insight to his feelings. The very last sentence of the the last page of the book stopped me in my tracks."},{"Title":"Bob, son of Battle","review":"Bob, Son of Battle is an old-fashioned tale, very enjoyable on a literal level, that rises to nearly epic proportions when examined as a character study. A story of shepherds and their dogs in northern England in the late nineteenth century, this book paints a fine portrait of faithful, skillful Bob and his gentle master, James Moore, but where the author truly shines is in his portrayal of Moore's and Bob's antagonists, the crotchety Adam M'Adam and his evil-tempered Red Wull. A book worth reading for its portrait of a century-old culture; of sheepdogs, their work, and the thrilling annual quest for the Dale Cup; and of a pitiful old man who is more complex than he at first seems."},{"Title":"Bob, son of Battle","review":"I love any book about dogs and have read pretty much anything I could find. I grew up reading the Terhune \\"Lad\\" series, Lassie, etc. and later I got involved in the Project Gutenberg project and started looking for dog books that were in the public domain that could be included, including some early Terhune books,Beautiful Joe,Greyfriars Bobby, etc. That's how I cam across Bob, Son of Battle. I was put off at first by the English dialect that it is written in, but soon became engrossed in what I soon realized was not so much a dog story, as one about a man and the failed relationship with his son. It is one of the best books I've read that explores the complexity of personality and how there is good and bad in all of us, but how easily things can unbalance to the wrong side. How difficult it can be sometimes for parents and children to communicate well. There are scenes in this book that really stay with you for the emotional impact they have. Anyone that loves great literature will enjoy this book, it is a real treasure that stands up the test of time as well as anything else I've read."},{"Title":"Bob, son of Battle","review":"I love this book \\" Bob, Son of Battle \\" It is as charmingly lively anticipating as a young boys coming of age, and as satisfyingly tender as an elders moments in memory.

Anyone have an explanation?"},{"Title":"Bob, son of Battle","review":"I liked Bob Son of Battle because I thought Bob was cute and nice. I didn't like when Bob was eating a lamb and blood was dripping."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"First off, let me say that this is not a bad book, even at hard-bound prices. The problem is that it would have been a better book if it had been twice as long. Let me explain. The plot is a series of snapshots of exciting or emotional episodes with very thin connecting material. The &quot;connecting material&quot; in SciFi or any speculative fiction usually describes how the people live and relate to each other when they are not under stress. It's often a better and more rewarding read than the action sequences. The connecting material wasn't used effectively in &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; and that's a shame because Ms. McCaffrey is one of the best at creating a society and having her characters really live in it.On the other hand, Ms. McCaffrey seems to be concluding her extended plot lines in all her series and &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; is worth reading just for that. The characters we met in &quot;Pegasus in Flight&quot; return and grow up. The real character problem here is the villains. I just can't buy good ole FlimFlam managing to have the freedom of the space station and arranging the big accident. He's not that smart - all the characters agree. And while our &quot;darling&quot; Ludmilla, Queen of the Space Station would be smart enough to pull off a small coup - no one's stupid enough to believe they could pull off a large coup in a telepathic environment. Space stations don't get &quot;taken over&quot; I don't care how many &quot;top&quot; people are attending the opening and available as hostages. &quot;Top&quot; people don't arrive without their own body guards. And if the body guards can't come, the celebrity doesn't arrive, either. Further, conspiracies that large fall apart under their own weight. Honestly now, Ludmilla is NOT a subtle kind of gal.Finally, though, Peter Reidinger is a wonderful character. McCaffrey matures him beautifully in the course of this book. I was disappointed in his relationship with the whimpy MD. I preferred Amariyah - she had much more personality but that's a quibble on my part. One final point, was Major Johnnie Green always so conniving? I don't recall this from the prior book. Oh yes... and how come we never see his wife?Unlike &quot;Pegasus in Flight&quot; which could have been read separately from &quot;To Ride Pegasus,&quot; &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; is a close sequel to 'Flight.' It must be read first for the new book to make sense. Both prior books are superior, especially 'Flight,' but &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; is certainly acceptable entry and closure from an extraordinary talent."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Altogether this one great piece of prose and should definitely be crowed as the best possible bridge between the Pegasus and Rowan/Tower and the Hive series. I thoroughly enjoyed it and consider it to be one of the top ten Anne McCaffrey novels ever written.For this installment of the Talent series, McCaffrey thrilled us with a much longer look into the heart of the parapsychics of the late 21st Century then we got in the first two books. Peter Reidinger's character develops in the ever-expanding psychic realm. From the first scenes in Bangladesh to the heart-stopping last \`port, Pegasus in Space keeps you on the edge of your seat. Rhyssa Owen-Lehardt, General Johnny Greene, Boris and Sascha Roznine, Tirla, Madlyn, Dorotea and the rest of the gang make excellent returning roles. Amariyah very much fills a gap that was left open at the end of Pegasus in Flight. Perhaps nothing was more shocking and awe-inspiring then the lasting effect she has on Peter. Great writing all around.Now for the positive technical stuff. I loved the opening \\"rescue\\" scene in Bangladesh and the edge-of-your-seat Padrugoi Mutiny. Beautifully written. Also, wonderful \\"scheming\\" on the part of Reidinger throughout. Nothing is funnier than watching General Greene jump from his chair in astonishment at something he himself did. Almost as if he sat on a whoopee-cushion. At 16/17 chapters it has a great length and every chapter blurs into the next, I couldn't put it down. I especially liked the scenes where Cass Cutler and Ranjit are scrounging the underbelly of Padrugoi and the Flimflam \\"chase scenes.\\" (reminds you of any scenes in Pegasus in Flight? Hmm...). Wonderful use of character mapping. Very \\"tidy.\\" You can almost see the situations as though you were there. Imagery is excellent. Great dramatic irony... We all knew Amariyah would save those torn plants... Love the Reidinger \\"pondering\\" scenes where Peter conceives of FT&amp;T and Callisto Tower. Johnny Greene is wonderful comic relief, as he seems to take on the roll of the older Peter Reidinger IV from the Rowan series. Oh yeah, and great ship names for the colony ships (wink, wink, nudge, nudge). Though I must admit to not catching on to the whole First Base thing until later in the book. My favorite scene is where Peter shows off \\"oh so timidly\\" to the Secretary of Space and his bean counters, perfect. All in all, a very well composed story on the part of McCaffrey. Kudos.Now for the unfortunate, negative technical stuff. As much as we all love a good McCaffrey Sci-Fi/Romance, this book tends to take after Nimisha's ship in its lack of. I particularly found myself missing the Sascha/Tirla scenes (or for that matter their character really at all...). A strange composition in that she keeps the reader thinking that Peter will go for Amariyah the entire time (or at least that's what I pulled out even though the age difference). Sort of a bait and switch, if you will. Not bad character development wise of Peter, but the time changes are frequent and can possibly confuse the reader if not taken in as a McCaffrey Original. For lack of a better word, the plot \\"simmered\\" but never really came to a boil (after Flimflam was out of the picture). It also took after most of the later Tower and the Hive books in the militaristic, \\"young resident Prime, older Admiral and commanders\\" look on Padrugoi. Good use of Amariyah as a micro-surgeon (if subconscious) instead of a more supporting kinetic roll which would favor Peter/Amariyah relationship. Nice use of science with Gadriel, but it was a tad \\"Hawkingish.\\"However, all around the book was marvelous. A must read for every Talent fan, or even for simply any McCaffrey fan. This was definitely a page-turned and an instant classic. Coming from myself (whom loved Pegasus in Flight and To Ride Pegasus and has all the Rowan books and has been patiently awaiting Pegasus in Space for a long time), I must say it was one heck of fine ride. Write on McCaffrey, write on!"},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Pegasus in Space provides the perfect link between Anne McCaffrey's Pegasus Series (To Ride Pegasus and Pegasus in Flight) and her Talent Series (The Rowan, Damia, Damia's Children, Lyon's Pride, and The Tower and the Hive) by showing the events that took place between Pegasus in Flight and The Rowan. The book blends the elements of both science fiction and fantasy well, describing the technology that allows expansion into new worlds while also giving the Talents powers that the reader can only dream of having. This novel also shows some of McCaffrey's strongest characterization in the past few years-- Peter Reidinger and Johnny Green are especially vivid and likable. Readers can not help but sympathize with Peter through his internal struggles and cheer at the points in the book where he succeeds. Perhaps Pegasus in Space's only flaw lies in the ease with which the enemy is repeatedly subverted. Still, Pegasus in Space is a must-read for all fans of the Talent books and McCaffrey's work."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"In the not so distant future, Earth has become so overcrowded that its people are forced to search outer space for planets to inhabit just so they can survive. A space station is erected so ships can be built and launched to other galaxies. Passengers will be in suspended animation until the crew finds a world they can colonize. The Talents, people with scientifically proven psychic powers play a pivotal role in the new world order. They teleport heavy items from earth to the space station, saving a fortune in fuel and transportation costs.The most powerful teleporter is Peter Reidenger, a paralyzed individual who remains mobile because of his psychic powers. The people running the space station eagerly accept Peter as a full team member even though some fear his power. On a space shuttle journey to the moon, someone sabotages the ship computers, forcing Peter to use his powers in ways he never knew he could in order to keep everyone alive. A full-scale investigation occurs to uncover the traitors who would rather destroy Peter for reasons of revenge rather than allow the people of earth to have a future in space.Although PEGASUS IN SPACE can stand alone as a superb work of science fiction, the novel is part of a trilogy (see PEGASUS IN FLIGHT and TO RIDE PEGASUS). This book links this saga with the Rowen collection as it shows the beginnings of a space-based society. Although the story line is classic space opera filled with action, there is great characterization in this work as well. The great Anne McCaffrey makes the people populating her novel feel complete, real and very much alive. The hero is not a marvelous rendition of Professor Xavior though some similar traits exist. Instead, he is a unique and special person who will not allow his true physical condition to stop him from enjoying life to the fullest. The talented Ms. McCaffrey, one of the top authors of the twentieth century, demonstrates she will also become one of the most beloved writers of the new millennium.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"I'm 27 and have Read Anne McCaffrey since I was in Grade Eight. My first book of hers was Dragonsdawn and I've been hooked ever since. At first I only wanted Pern but as I've matured I grew to love all her work. The talent series (both Rowan and Pegasus) have become my favorites. With Pegasus in Space I was enchanted from start to finish. I didn't intend to read it until my fiance had left town for a week but ended up reading it in one 2 to 3 hour sitting. I didn't feel a lack in the older characters because Peter was essentially the focus of this book. Just as Tirla was more evident in Pegasus in Flight. I simply loved it. And I can't wait for the next installment. {The way she linked the Rowan and Pegasus series was just plain wonderful)."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Another great McCaffrey Book. I read it in one reading. You just have to love a book that has spaceships name &quot;Andre Norton&quot;, &quot;Arrakis&quot; and &quot;Bradbury&quot;. As always well written.

As I recall the only time teleportation is mentioned is in &quot;To Ride Pegasus&quot; and not at all in connection with Peter Reidinger and Johnny Greene, yet at the beginning of this book, which is set within months of &quot;To Bridle Pegasus&quot;, (Rhyssa is still pregnant with her first child) both of them are teleporting supplies and equipment to Padragoi Station. Still a great read and worth the price. Anne shows the beginning of the FT&amp;T.

For those just beginning McCaffrey, start with Dragon flight or to Ride Pegasus. All in all a good novel and well worth the money paid."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Pegasus in Space is a nice cap to the trilogy-so-far of the Pegasus Talents books, but it lacks a little in overall plot and intrest--the previous two books, To Ride Peagsus and Pegasus in Flight, are quite a bit better. Pegasus in Space did a good job of finishing all the previous character's stories, and it was a very interesting prequel to The Rowan Talents books--it and its two mates set up the situation in The Rowan and onward books quite nicely--showing the origins of Talent and, in Pegasus in Space, the origin of FT&amp;T. But besides finishing up the trilogy and setting the stage for later books, it was pretty lacking. First of all, Pegasus in Space starts out making a very big deal about Amariyah--but never finishes it. She's this phenominal healer Talent, but the only mention of her after the age of 13 is such an &quot;oh, and by the way&quot; deal that it leaves one a little confused, after all the hype about her in the first part of the book. Then, in the middle of the book, Anne McCaffrey switches into heavy *heavy* sci-fi mode with all her descriptions of space walking and shuttle launching, etc. For a person like myself--a lover of sci-fi/fantasy, but not a die-hard sci-fi reader--it got quite boring and monotonus. And the whole book was mainly about one chracter--Peter Reidinger. Not that a story is not allowed to have a main character, but after the previous two books, which were both relatively oligarchal as far as characters went, it was quite a change. Seemed a bit of an overkill on Peter. The whole book was about his obsession with space. Like I said, it's a nice setup for The Rowan, but it was very overkill. And the only &quot;bad guys&quot; were a weak resurrection of Pegasus in Flight's main villians. It was nice to know what happened to all the characters from the previous two books, but they all paled in comparison to Peter's role in the book, and only got brief mentions and were reverted to completely two-dimensional personalites. Without the previous books, the accessory characters would have been totally lost. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable, with the happily ever after ending and the little dip into romance that Anne McCaffrey never fails to make in all of her books, but it lacked in comparison to the two previous books in the Pegasus trilogy. And it especially lacks if one chooses to comapre it to the Dragonriders of Pern books--which are all awesome novels, true masterpieces by Anne McCaffrey. Pegasus in Space seemed a little forced, as if the author had just wanted to get the story done, rather than enjoy it. But even for all its faults, it deserves three-stars, because it *was* good and because, of course, nearly everything Anne McCaffrey touches is golden. Pretty good, but most certainly not the best."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"This book picks up where Pegasus in Flight ends, with the addition of new psychics and old friends of Peter, who help him in unexpected and startling ways. Once I started reading the book I got to page 114 before tired eyes forced me to go to sleep.

McCaffrey's use of a wide range of telepathic powers (Talents) opened my mind (pun intended) to a vast array of possiblities. The progress of Peter's kenetic growth was not all that suprising yet when he 'ported to &quot;First Base&quot; (on the Moon)I was happy at first, impressed second than third annoyed; because when Peter &quot;landed&quot; Limo-34 he nearly destroyed the Apollo 12 historical site. What really suprised me was the regrowth of Peter's nerve endings and spinal cord, truly the most important event in the book (way more important than travelling 45 light years in the blick of an eye). Yet while the book was quickly paced it lacked the edge that I had found in &quot;Pegasus in Flight&quot;. And most upsetting was that Trile was only a minor character in this novel. The unusual thing is one I mentioned in my review of &quot;To Ride Pegasus,&quot; that was a lack of underhandedness by secret government/military involvement. Maybe McCaffrey is more of a Utopion, and I a Dysutopion. Or more likley the X-Files has just lodged itself in societies sub-conscience and we so look for such deceptions, but when it is not found, that scares us even more."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"I went through it in an afternoon.

There was far too much going on. It seems like McCaffrey decided to wind up every single plotline begun or even THOUGHT of beginning in the previous books. We get to see not only everyone married, but the number, names, and birth-order of their children. The plot moves too fast. Rebellion? Bam. Illness? Bam. Evil bad guys doing their thing again? Bam. One problem after the other, all solved with lightning-quick speed. It felt more like a plot outline than a book sometimes. Also, the new characters didn't feel very well fleshed-out. I didn't really care about any of them. That said, it WAS nice to have another outing with these characters. I do agree that more Tirla would have been nice, although that's one of my main complaints: too much time spent with the new characters (who were dull), not enough with the old (except Peter).One-sentence synopsis: Good if you've read and liked the other Pegasus books and want to find out what happens to the characters, bad as a beginner to the series."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Like others, I impatiently waited for this book. I greatly enjoyed Pegasus in Flight, and, to a lesser extent, To Ride Pegasus (the two books which come before Pegasus in Space).In the end, my experiences with it were disappointing. The motivations for the villains made little sense, other than as a way to move the plot along. Amariya's gift, too, seemed there to serve a specific purpose in the plot, and nothing more (as a character, she seemed horribly underdeveloped. All right, so she loves Peter. And gardening. Doesn't the poor child do -anything- else?). There was too little of older characters whom I wanted to see, and too much of newer characters with no attention paid to making them interesting. Finally, the &quot;secret of the generators&quot; made very little sense to me (perhaps I'm simply bitter because I, myself, am tone deaf?)Is it worth reading? If you liked the ones before, and happen to see a copy at the library, picking up a copy might not be a bad idea.

There is no one stopping him, no government(CIA, NSA, FBI)underhandness,and when Henry is tested the first time, with one of his people's psi abilties, his rich partner, George Henner, bails him out and from there, the psi have won, and that leads the way to Daffyd's time (Pegasus in Flight) and Peter's and Rhyssa's time(Pegausus in Space)Maybe the book would be better if Henry and George had to deal with MIB's or some other \\"XFiles\\" stuff. If Henry, George, Rhyssa, Peter, Tirla, or Daffyd had to contend with that, or be hurt or injured or one of them killed due to underhandness, I would believe the books more. How about a story in the very last where, Rhyssa talks about all the racism (ie \\"XMen\\") that Henry, and later Daffyd, had to contend with in the early days of the agency and how Henry was shot and George was killed, and how Daffyd had to go into hiding?(think of \\"The Terminator\\")We would all like to believe in an utopian society, but realistically, people can't do it.

This one, however, was overlong and unbelievably tedious. It is a character-driven (not story-driven) book; a series of thinly-connected vignettes, apparently meant to spotlight the psychic personalities of whom the author seems overly enamored. This style is often seen in fanzine-writing (I know this because I've done it); but it is an indulgence less often seen in a writer this accomplished.As a reader I was NOT enamored of these characters, who seemed superficially one-dimensional (for the number of pages allotted them!). The \\"villains\\" were positively cartoonish; and the circumstances of their \\"menace,\\" unconvincing. A felon, convicted or heinous crimes against persons, \\"sentenced\\" to unsupervised \\"janitorial work\\" aboard a space station? Are you KIDDING me?!? No government could be that stupid -- not even a liberal one.I didn't finish the book.

As with the best of McCaffrey I finished the book too quickly - so reread it immediately!"},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"This is the longest and last (to date) volume of McCaffrey's \\"Saga of the Talents,\\" published 27 years after the first (To Ride Pegasus), 10 afterThe Rowan, and a year afterThe Tower and the Hive (Rowan). Her objective was to tie together the chronologically earlier with the later books in the series, while still (as she points out in her Acknowledgments) trying to stay true to the parameters put in place when she wrote the first short story about the Talents in 1959.In the late 21st Century, humanity is finally making serious attempts to colonize the stars--and none too soon, for Earth is overcrowded and many people live in miserable conditions in vast tenement blocks. Central to the space program are the \\"parapsychics,\\" the 0.03% of the species who are born with special gifts--the empaths, telepaths, kinetics, precogs, and dozens of lesser talents. Among them is 15-year-old Peter Reidinger, who is a quadriplegic and an enormously powerful telekinetic: given a generator to get in \\"gestalt\\" with and draw power from, he can \\"toss\\" just about anything, regardless of its size, shape, or mass, to just about any destination, as long as he has a picture of that destination to focus on. He dreams of someday being able to hurl colony ships to distant systems, if he can only, like Archimedes, find \\"a place to stand\\"--for in this future the constraints of the speed of light mean that without instantaneous telekinetic transport, colonists must spend centuries in cryogenic suspension and colonies will quickly begin to lag technically behind the homeworld, with news and inventions unable to reach them any faster than that speed. Peter's foster sister Amareeyah has a special gift too, though it's not as showy as his and indeed takes a long time to be identified.The first great test of Peter's powers comes when his friend Gen. Johnny Greene wangles invitations for him and two others of the Talented to the ceremony marking the inauguration of Padrugoi Space Station--a function for which everyone thought they'd been overlooked. As it turns out, they hadn't--the oversight was 100% deliberate--and it's only their presence that prevents the bitter and jealous Construction Manager, Ludmila Barchenka, from successfully fomenting a mutiny and seizing control of the facility. Because of the part he plays in this action, Peter gets a leg up into the space program--and finds that as his work takes him regularly to Padrugoi and the Moon, he's in peril from enemies old and new, including a couple of very nasty and well-connected figures fromPegasus in Flight. And all the while, as he grows older and his powers mature, he must also search for ways to make his dream come true.McCaffrey inserts several links to the present in her story: two of her colony ships are the \\"Andre Norton\\" (named after the early sf writer who probably inspired most of the author's generation) and the \\"Arrakis;\\" Peter conscientiously does his daily \\"Reeve exercises\\" to keep muscle tone in his paralyzed body (the novel is dedicated to actor/activist Christopher \\"Superman\\" Reeve). And although her future Earth is now unified and at peace, terrorists remain a thorn in everyone's side. The book is lengthy and not notable for action, but given its purpose as stated, that's probably inevitable. Though I didn't like it as well as I have the Pern, Doona, or Brainship books, my deep interest in psychic powers guaranteed that I would find it interesting, and certainly it succeeds on its own terms."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"All books by Anne McCaffrey are amazing!

Pegasus in Space takes place within a year of the conclusion of Pegasus in Flight, and follows the Talented Peter Reidinger, Rhyssa Owen-Lehardt, and Johnny Green from Earth to the Stars.Though observant readers might notice some continuity problems between the two novels, Pegasus in Space is an emminently satisfying conclusion to the events first described in 'In Flight'. Multidimensional, believable characters, Peter, Rhyssa, Johhny and the other psychically gifted Talents provide realistic heros in a not-so-far-fetched near future.Pegasus in Space chronicals the begining of the FT&amp;T and is a better bridge to &quot;The Rowen&quot; series, taking place some 100 years in the future. McCaffrey blends Science Fiction with Fantasy almost seamlessly. Her science is believable, and her view of the future, given the problems in today's world, quite likely.Like much of her work, Anne McAffrey's Talent novel is quite enjoyable, and leaves readers smiling."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"I enjoyed this sequel immensely. I recommend this and the entire series for page turning fun and excitement and really great character development. However, I do have one little nit to pick. In the naming of the various sections of First Base it was somehow forgotten that Aaron starts with an 'a'! I have read all the Pegasus and Talent series - most many times and enjoyed them all. I also have read (and will continue to read) the other McCaffrey series (Dragons, Brain Ships, the whole works). Ms McCaffrey has provided me with many hours of reading enjoyment and even more hours of contemplating my own extensions to her various stories. Thanks."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"This is the weakest of the Pegasus/Talent series books. The whole book feels rushed to tie off the series, the villians are shallow and the plot weak. And I had previously thought that 'The Tower and the Hive' was rushed to tie off that end of the series. This was even more so.I enjoy Anne McCaffrey's books and actually prefer this set of series to most of her other work. I will be sorry if the series does end but based on this last book, better it ends than weak work when I know she can do so much better. This book only gets 3 stars from an author who usually delivers 4 and 5 star material.My ratings scale: 1=don't bother; 2=if you read it get it from the library only; 3=read it, either from the library or buy it if you are a fan, need to complete your collection, or have the cash; 4=buy it, read it! 5=BUY IT!

It flows as though this was the next book McCaffrey wrote, instead of coming back to the story 10 years later! Learning about the origins of the Talents was so rewarding. I would love for McCaffrey to write more adventures with Peter Remlinger..."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"'Pegasus In Space' is a very nice addition to Ms. McCaffrey's Talent series which started with 'To Ride Pegasus' and continued thru 'The Tower And The Hive.' This book picks up where 'Pegasus in Flight' (the second book) left off as the Talented and the people of Earth are just beginning to push into space. The struggle to get the space station, moonbase, and Mars base completed continues. Also, continuing is the struggle of the Talented to be accepted by 'normal' people, who continue to react with fear and prejudice...The story centers mainly around the life of Peter Reidinger, a Talented young boy who was first introduced in 'Flight.' It spans about 4 years of his life as we watch him mature both in age and in Talent while persuing his dream of space travel. The book, also, gives us brief glimpses of other characters from the previous book, such as Center Director Rhyssa Owen-Lehardt, her husband Dave, Dorthea (first seen in 'To Ride Pegasus'), Tirla, Sacha, and Colonel Johnny Green. There is, also, a new character introduced, Amiriyah, who has a profound and surprising affect on Peter's life...Tho' I enjoyed the book, I had two problems with the story: First, the 4 year span is more of a 4 year jump. It takes us too rapidly from Peter's 15th birthday to his 19th, showing only a few brief glimpses in between. My second problem is along the same lines - those brief glimpses of the other characters were far too brief. I would have like to have 'seen' more into the lives of Tirla, Sacha, Rhyssa, etc. and not just how they related to Peter. But, overall, it was a good story and I liked revisiting old familiar characters - I just would have like to have 'visited' longer...My advice, if you haven't already done it, is to read 'Pegasus In Flight' first. 'Space' contains characters, refers to characters and events which appeared in the previous book, while giving very little explanation to them. So, if you haven't read 'Flight' you might have trouble following this book."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"The Pegasus series is not only an interesting series in itself, but is naturally the bridge into The Rowen and follow-on Talent books. I particularly like the way she portrays telepaths and their often rocky relationship with &quot;normal&quot; people.I, too, fear that Anne may be wrapping up the series. I hope not, because I would definitely like to know just how Peter sets up FT&amp;T, and learn about the Talents who help colonize the worlds portrayed in the other series.While I adored the Pern series, the Pegasus and Talent series are my favorte McCaffrey books. If you like people stories, instead of technical science fiction, you'll enjoy these books. They do read better in sequence, but I think you'll like them any way you can get them."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Pegasus in Space is a natural follow up to Pegasus in Flight. However, this book is lacking much of what I expect from Anne McCaffrey. The first half of the book involves so much he-said - she said, that I was truly bored for the first time ever reading this wonderful author. I do own every one of her books but this one is a truly disappointing read. Weak dialog, a weak plot, characters that lack any depth at all - What happened??? This is NOT the Anne McCaffrey that has given me many, many hours of true pleasure. I do not recommend this book to my friends - I don't want them to read a truly embarassing literary turkey."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Anne MacCaffrey's books typically hit where the heart is, with excellent characterization that is often deeply touching. This book is entirely lacking that. Yes, it was good to revisit old friends, but when comparing this book to its predecessors, it seems almost not worth the read. Also, the information dumps were handled quite poorly, and I found myself skimming through them.In addition, an entire subplot seemed ridiculous after the motivation for it was revealed. All in all, this book was a major disappointment, and not up to Ms. MacCaffrey's usual standards."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"This new addition to the Talent series did not disappoint! As another reviewer mentioned, it certainly WAS a great link between the Pegasus books and the Tower stories. I agree with another reader, however,in that the villains were &quot;too&quot; incidental in the story. I kept waiting for all hell to break loose but it never did. That is the only flaw, though, and the rest of the book was terrific. The thing that appeals to me most about McCaffrey's works, this included, is her ability to develop characters and relationships between them that seem so real, one wishes they could be. I was elated to find this as a Rocket Edition, too! She is my favorite author, so I do hope Del Rey and her other publishers would be willing to put out all her books in this format -- I'm positive they wouldn't regret it. If you liked the Pegasus or the Tower stories, I'm sure you'll like this one! Ms. McCaffrey, if you read these reviews, here's a request for a book about Amariyah during that 11 year jump!"},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"I love the works of Anne McCaffrey and anxiously awaited the release of a new &quot;Pegasus&quot; book. The thing I love most about her works is the fact that you feel like you really KNOW the people she writes about. I feel this book was way to technical, very little about the lives of the people. Many times I found myself confused or bored during the discussion of how the gestalt worked etc... I cried like a baby when Masterharper Robinton died in the Dragonriders series but didn't even flinch when Dorotea had her stroke. It was like you already knew the outcome before you ever got there.

I was very dissapointed in the book because it seemed to forget about the characters and got heavy into the Sci-Fi Tech stuff. Anne McCaffrey spent too much of the book detailing space suits and other technical stuff, which was rather boring and monotonous to read.In the previous book , Pegasus in Flight, the book focused on Peter Reidinger, Tirla, and Rhyssa Owen. In this book the character of Tirla appears briefly in the beginning and then is only mentioned by other characters afterward. Rhyssa Owen fares little better as her character whines about protecting Peter while he is in space. A new character introduced in the book is Amareeya and her only purpose in the book is to further Peter's plot. Amareeya, who is obsessed with gardening and plants, drones on about her garden mentioning the planets using there latin names. One thing that puzzled me about this character was that she seemed quite aware of her talent and how to use it and yet the other characters seemed oblivious to this. No one talked to Amareeya about her Talent or about Talent in general.And this is what was wrong with the book, the characters never seemed to talk to each other about their lives or emotions. It would have been nice for the author to focus on Tirla's life rather than every once and awhile adding a throwaway line about her engagement, marriage, etc. Ms. McCaffrey seemed to forget her characters in favor of endless Sci-Fi Tech talk. If you are buying this book expecting to spend some time with the characters then you will be dissapointed.My recomendation is that if you are interested in reading the book - take it out of the library."},{"Title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"I thoroughly enjoy all Anne McCaffrey's stories and this one was wonderful.

It includes much hard-to-find material, including a translation (!) of Queneau's One-hundrerd-trillion sonnets, and some neat experiments in severe overdetermination. It also includes the wonderful Skinhead Hamlet, by Richard Curtis. (Oddly, the editors--Harry Mathews is one of the major members of the workshop--say they can't track him down, but he's the screenwriter for Four Weddings and a Funeral, so shouldn't be too hard to find.) Lot's of interesting material on Georges Perec, and also on an American writer who wrote a novel in which no word is used more than once--a kind of hyper-Flaubertian enterprise."},{"Title":"Oulipo Compendium (Atlas Archive)","review":"If you ever come across Arthur Brand's little article on the Oulipo, cherish it. I read it back in the late 80s, in an anthology somewhere, and I've never been able to find it since. It whet my appetite for these crazy masters of restricted composition, who spend their time devising totally new ways to write. This isn't a book for the &quot;poetry of everyday life&quot; set, or writing workshop clones. It's a book, as Brand said, for &quot;mad scientists, mathematicians, monster-makers and angels.&quot; It's a writer's encylopedia, stuffed with ideas, strategies, graphs, games, machines, etc for making poetry and fiction."},{"Title":"Oulipo Compendium (Atlas Archive)","review":"Before reading this book, I didn't know anything about Oulipo....do you? If not, here's the gist: Oulipo are a bunch of slightly crazy people who want to find new and fun ways to write stuff. So, they create all these interesting and zany techniques to generate their writing...to me, it seems similar to how modern composers generate notes and rhythms using tone rows and stuff like that. This book is a &quot;compendium&quot; of these techniques, Oulipo authors, their works, etc. I think it's great. I'd recommend it to writers who want to try something new (as opposed to just writing &quot;from the heart&quot;, or whatever) and I'd also recommend it to people who like modern, formalist type stuff. Have fun."},{"Title":"Oulipo Compendium (Atlas Archive)","review":"Oulipo is great! This book is just so full of STUFF. What they did was just spend a lot of time thinking of wild ways to inspire &amp; direct writing, &amp; what we're left with is this labyrinth of experimrents.

One of its founders, Raymond Queneau is the author of Exercises in Style.The book is a compendium of different techniques and approaches which are described, often with illuminating examples. It gives a fascinating glimpse into a host of different ways of thinking and looking at the world.One of the most fascinating consequences of constraints is that, far from reducing ideas and opportunities, the introduction of constraints serves as the stimulus to new ideas.Just take a look at the spam arriving with your email to see the creative lengths that spammers will go to, to get past anti-spam software.

From there onwards the book is a treasure trove of ideas to change the way you see.My personal favourite is \`The Skinhead Hamlet' by Richard Curtis which uses the technique of substituting a vocabulary drawn from a radically different environment, in this case \`skinheads', and applying it to Shakespeare's play.

This book is a synopsis of the surgery specialty around 1920s. The book is unexpectedly modern in terms of surgical diseases it describes but much outdated when it comes to pathophysiology and treatment. The reason I highly recommend reading this book is best stated in the foreword by Dr. Pestana: \\"[The book] puts our profession [surgery] in perspective. We have indeed come a long way. But let's not get too proud of our surgical practice in the first decade of the 21st century.

If you don't care about the prices, the 2001 edition offers very little compared to the 2000 edition. One of those new 2000 proof sets can be had for a similar price... The 2001 edition of the red book changes little from the 2000 edition. A number of B&amp;W pictures have been replaced with color versions of the same, and the results are generally more pleasing. Mintage figures have been updated to include 1999 numbers. The new quarters program is nicely presented, with a complete listing of all 50 states and the expected release years, as well as photos of all five 1999 designs. The new Sacagawea dollar is also listed with a brief introduction similar to that given other coins. With the exception of the new quarters and dollar, the entire regular issue (250+ pages) section is identical to the 2000 edition: no new error or variation photos or descriptions have been added. The commemoratives section has had some additional photos added and the bullion section has been re-arranged. The index also appears to be slightly improved. Giving the red book a rating is a bit silly, since most people buy it for a reference anyway. If I was comparing it to the 2000 edition, I'd give it a low rating. However, since I buy the new edition every year without thinking twice, I'll give it five stars."},{"Title":"A Guide Book of United States Coins 2001","review":"Handy, convenient, and more reliable than the internet.

The authors discuss the fact that draft horses have different digestion than light horses. There are hoof problems, muscular problems, and nutrient storage issues here that are unheard of among light horses as well. It was an eye-opener to read how many differences there are between these creatures and their lighter cousins. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for any prospective or present draft horse owner. There are many issues here that could be vital to your horse's health.As for other things... do not expect this book to overly extol the draft horse's positive values. It does briefly mention them, but in a more clinical, objective sense rather than warm praise. This is indeed an 'owner's manual', reminding me for the most part of an instructional book on a new lawnmower, except extremely well-written, easy to understand, and simple to apply. It is filled with good information.It seems that, if you are interested in such a book, you are already interested in the beautiful and enchanting draft horse.

I'm experienced with lighter breeds but only somewhat familiar with the specific maladies that can affect drafts (such as Shivers) which is why I bought this book. It was a great tool- I've already been loaning it out as a matter of fact! By NO MEANS is this an extensive study, but for a broad overview (with some specifics) it was perfect! I'm impressed by the way that the authors offered up some common habits that they weren't familiar with personally (which they specified) as alternative options to the way they work. This was a perfect starting point for me before I delve into the heavy horse world. Obviously, a book that is 231 pages isn't expected to be an all-inclusive compendium.Another reviewer stated that this was a poor reference because it didn't mention certain specifics- such as the length of time in between shoeing/trimming hooves and floating teeth. Indeed, this book specifically discusses those timelines (6-8 wks for trim- pg 48, once a year for floating- pg 79) as well as pointing out that you're best bet is to consult an expert in the field who has experience with heavy horses. In addition, the authors even warn that it can often be difficult to find experts (vets, farriers, etc) who are experienced much less willing to work with heavy horses."},{"Title":"Draft Horses: An Owner's Manual","review":"This really is THE Owner's Manual for draft horses!

This book does not give enough details nor does it explain the differences between draft horses and regular horses -- for example, draft horses only have to have their teeth floated maybe once every 2 years (shorter for some longer for others) as compared to a regular smaller breed horse. And their hooves need to be trimmed about once every 8-9 weeks as opposed to 4 weeks with a regular horse. Vet Schools and Farrier Schools do not teach but very little on draft horses, leading these folks to believe that draft horses should be treated exactly like their smaller cousins.

It begins with Wiener vs. Ito definitions of the stochastic integral and then takes on through stochastic calculus on manifolds, including stochastic calculus in the complex plane and on lie groups. Dyson had written earlier on the latter topic, and one of his papers is referenced. Here are some half-baked notes:1. The Markov property is not mentioned, it's asserted that 'Brownian motion starts afresh at stopping times' (pg. 10, 50).2. Time changes make it clear that only t-dependent difusion coefficients are treated in that case (pg. 31, 36, 41, 68 (Levy's theorem)).3. the connection of Hermite polynomials to the exponential martingale is treated thoroughly (pg. 37).4. Ito's proof of uniqueness and the condition for lack of finite time singularities is given on pg. 52.5. Finite time blow up is treated further (this explains why the stopping time is an important topic), pp. 54, 65, 796. Kolmogorov's backward diffusion eqn. has the wrong sign for the time derivative (pg. 64). McKean probably asumed time independent drift and diffusion and wrote 't-s' without informing the reader.7.Problem 2 for stopping times on pg 27 is easy and instructive.8. Sdes on tangent space are introduced via metric defined by elliptic operator, pg. 82 90, with patching together of solutions treated formally with no example (typical of discussions in differential geometry, the real work is left for the reader).9. Cameron-Martin-Girsanov on pp. 67.10. Brownian motion in the complex plane (!) via stereographic projection from the 2-sphere, pg. 106.11. Brownian motion on Lie groups, pg. 115.I've only scanned the book superficially to se what's in it, working easy exercises (with Friedman and Durrett as basis), topics 8, 10 and 11 are interesting and advanced and will require a lot of hard work."},{"Title":"Aged by Culture","review":"Gullete's observation that \\"We are aged more by culture than by chromosomes\\" piqued my curiosity enough to buy the book...and then WOW!

An up-market coffee-table book. We are treated to a behind the scenes look at the television Saint. However, those expecting a review of the novels will be disappointed. The book deals only with TV and film.The author obviously enjoys his subject, and though plainly serious about it keeps it all extremely light-hearted.For those that have just come into contact with recent re-runs of the TV series, or for those of us that can remember the originals, this book is an extremely pleasant and interesting trip down memory lane.For those Charteris afficianados amongst us, the book is a worthwhile addition to a collection as it provides some good background information.

The author is an historian and writes in a style that is easy to read. This is a real page turner and gives the reader an excellent insight into the time and life of the last Tsar of Russia."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Having put off reading \\"Catherine The Great\\" as I didn't think I would enjoy reading either Russian history or 18th Century history, I was thrilled with Robert Massie's ability to hold me spellbound in that book. So much so that I immediately downloaded \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\". Once again, he weaves a thoroughly enjoyable story of Russian history, while keeping the reader interested in the people involved. I had never been taught about the last Czar, other than the brief note that they were murdered when the Bolsheviks took control after the Russian Revolution in 1917.First, Nicholas and Alexandra is one of the greatest love stories I have ever read. They truly loved each other, and were devoted to each other. Yes, this was The Victorian Era. And, all of the European leaders were cousins and descendants of Queen Victoria of England. However, many of them were in unhappy marriages, with their mistresses and affairs, or on their second or third marriages. Not so with Nicholas and Alexandra. Of course, I knew about their son's hemophilia, and that Empress Alexandra was a devoted follower of Rasputin. But, I did not know exactly why she was (she deeply believed that Rasputin had saved her son after all of the medical doctors had given-up on him). Massie shows Nicholas as a kind and hard working leader of Russia. No, he wasn't the brightest leader in the world. But, he deeply loved his people. As with the other monarchs of the era, he had been trained to believe that he should rule his people totally. At the time, the vast majority of the Russians truly loved him. When there were problems, they blamed the people above them for the problems [and there were many], but they didn't blame their beloved leader. Massie shows how the Russian system of government failed Nicholas. He had to make decisions based on bits and pieces of information. And, when this failed in World War I, as it was bound to, the fault was laid on him.Robert Massie allows you to understand both sides of the horrors in Russia. The tragedy of the Russian people, and the tragedy of a ruler and his family who are caught in a changing world, in a situation that cannot understand. As I said, this book is highly entertaining, and informative. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I was looking for a book that could tell the history of this family and i found a great one!Once you start to read, you can't leave it!It's a envolving, tragic and sad history...and Massie's work is remarkable.

You can tell that his writting style has improved since writing this book. His later book flow better in that it reads more like a novel. In the beginning, the text gets bogged down in a lot of details that don't add much to the narrative. As you progress through the book, it become easier to read.I bought this book as a travel book because I fly a lot.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I read this book in high school over 20 years ago. It totally changed the way I looked at the world and sparked my interest in international affairs. Full, epic, and sad story very well told!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Here we have an aggregation of factual stories which effectively summarizes multiple historical events, chiefly of late-period Tsarist Russia, delivered by Robert K. Massie in the artful style of a great novelist.The principal theme is that of the marriage and family life of Tsar Nicholas [Romanov] II and his wife, the German Princess Alexandra, their privileged fairy tale existence with their five children, and their tragic and sudden fall, (and subsequent murders perpetrated by the Bolsheviks.)A parallel story craftily unfolds regarding Grigory Rasputin, the so-called \\"Mad Monk,\\" and how, though a comedy of tragic errors, Rasputin's remarkable and almost mystical influence over the Tsarina Alexandra and her weak husband gave rise to Lenin's successful conversion of the Russian government to that of Bolshevism (Communism.)A third tale is more medical and genetic than it is historic, that of hemophilia. The Tsarevich (Nicholas II's heir and only son, Alexis) was a hemophiliac, a disease which the child inherited through his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria of England. It was Rasputin who seemed to keep this child alive during times of medical crisis and thus cemented the Tsarina's unswayable belief in his apparently godly powers of healing. Unfortunately for the Tsar, she also fell under Rasputin's phenomenal influence in other realms of opinion, mainly that of how Russia could best be governed during a raging European war.All these chronicles are woven into one excellent timeline and account of the Russian Monarchy's decline, culminating in tragedy for nearly all involved.If there is a void in this tale, it's perhaps lacking a Dostoyevsky-ish paradigm on the plight of the Russian people during this turbulent period, a facet which was equally key to the events which transpired. While this actuality is mentioned as a matter of fact, I didn't feel that this important aspect of the legacy was driven home to the reader. Still, supplementary reading of the fiction of Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Lyeskov, and other notable Russian masters of period literature can fill in the gaps which Massie apparently felt unable to cover. Granted, such explorations may well have turned this fine history book into a burdensome tome since there is so much to say on the topic of Russian peasant misery.A superb (if little known) non-fiction work which conveys the plight of the Russian people prior to and during this bleak era was written by Prince Peter Kropotkin in biographical form:Memoirs of a Revolutionist (Collected Works of Peter Kropotkin).The author, Robert K. Massie, adopts the \\"linear\\" view of the sudden fall of the Romanov dynasty. To garner the entirety of what actually transpired during the Russian Revolution(s) [1905 and 1917] in detail, it would perhaps be better to read a text on that specific facet of history:A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution: 1891-1924. Figes is a renowned and widely-published authority on Russian history.The bigger picture of Massie's written legacy is that of the general madness which ultimately consumed most Monarchies from within -- the inevitable end seems nearly always to culminate with the extravagance and opulence on the parts of the royals and the nobility, and their appurtenant obliviousness and hubristic attitude toward the inevitable extreme poverty of the masses. In other words, the royals begin dwelling on their personal belief that they are indeed demi-gods. Throughout the text here, that historically factual concept is plainly conveyed to the reader.This book was written in 1967 and for that reason, Massie got decoyed by Nicholas Sokolov's somewhat flawed investigation [1919] of the mass murder of the Romanovs. Sokolov's difficult inquiry was generally a good one; however, we now know that his conclusions concerning the final disposition of the corpses of Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children was incorrect. They were not tossed down a mine shaft... they were buried in fairly shallow graves.Due chiefly to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent fall of the Soviet dictatorship, modern investigation teams have now been able to actually recover the remains of most of the Romanovs from their long-secret graves. The primary issue of contention which remains (between two separate teams of investigators) is whether it is Marie or Anastasia who continues to be unrecovered. This question will likely be resolved to the satisfaction of most at some later date. The Tsarevitch's mortal relics also remain missing.Some would say that the Romanovs got precisely what they deserved while others would assert that their demise was a shameful national tragedy. Thankfully, Massie allows the individual reader to make this determination.In summary, this is an outstanding book, nicely illustrated with several pages of relevant black-and-white photographs, and I know of no superior choice on the topic which covers all the aspects which this one does -- I highly recommend it. And if you would like to see this fine work brilliantly conveyed through the media of film, then be sure to see the 1974 BBC mini-series production of:Fall of Eagles."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I first read this book in seventh grade in 1990, my geography teacher lent it to me and I read it cover to cover in one weekend. This book sparked my interest and I have been reading and studying Russian history since. Massie paints a vivid picture of the life of the last tsar, a man who never wanted the title in the first place. I continually go back to reread this book. It will always be my favorite of the books about this period of Russian history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I last read this in 1996, but the book has stayed with me. Massie gives a moving insight into the life of the tragic figure Tsar Nikolai II, although he does not stray from the history of his reign. Nikolai was a man who did not want to be Tsar from the start, he had not been trained for the role of Tsar by his father Aleksandr II, and this was to be a major factor in his misunderstanding of his role and position in the Russian hierarchy.He was a weak man, dominated by his wife and followed the views and advice of the last minister he saw, proving that he was neither willing nor able for his chosen role.With excellent photographic evidence of the Tsar and Tsarina and family, Massie's account of his life is detailed and easy to read. If you want to find out about the structure of the Russian autocracy and Nikolai's life, then this book is worth the money."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"nicholas and alexandra should never had become czar and crazina of russia.nicholas was just to weak spirit and alexandra to strong without know the real russia people.she saw russian as childern who needed to be told how to run their lives by the papa czar.she hide her son illness and brought in a sexual twisted man of god into her family,ruin the romanov's relationship with it's people.stopping changes that would give citzen russian say in their country.in the end the people turn on the romanov's every thing end tragical."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is an awsome book.Glittering courts,sparkling jewelerry,formidable millitia-the essentials of the Russian court picturised with the minutest detail.Mr.Massie has put forward a mother's love,a king's worries.the immense love and bonding in this beautiful book"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This was the first of many books I read about Nicholas and Alexandra and remains my favorite.

I will read all other books by Massie and highly recommend both Peter the Great and Nicholas and Alexandra."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"What a tour de force! A wonderful, exciting history of the last Tsar and his family. For those of us who are victims of a US educational system that has little interest in teaching us about key non-American historical figures like Rasputin, this book is extraordinarily revealing. As others have noted, it reads more like a novel than history, except the content is historical fact (or as close as one gets, given the limitations of when it was written and the ambiguities of complex episodes).Just to offer criticism for the sake of some balance, the book does not completely inform the reader of the economic and cultural background to the events. I finished the book wondering, If Russia was little industrialized compared with Britain and Germany, was was it here that Communist revolution was able to succeed? But it is the virtue of this book that, rather than discouraging the reader, the text only encourages you to learn more."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie's writing is the best in Nicholas & Alexandria.

This book is very engaging, and a reader will find it hard to stop reading. It becomes so apparent that Nicholas was absolutely the wrong person at the wrong time, and Massie is very adept at showing why this misguided ruler was undone by a violent revolution. One can easily notice that Massie is sympathetic to his subjects, and has a slight bias against the revolutionaries such as Lenin and Trotsky who ultimately had him killed. Overall, this book does a fantastic job of keeping a reader's interest, and is lushly provided with flowing descriptions of life for all of the people of Russia and the growing revolution that would undo the reign of one of Europe's oldest monarchies."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This was a highly enjoyable book. It takes you a while to read, but it's worth all the time you put into it. If you like learning about history but you don't want to read something as boring as a textbook, then read this. It is historical and yet it is written as a story about a family in a time of troubles. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Amazing book! I have so much empathy for the Russian people now. I only wish there were more books like it, either on Russia, or any other country. Parts of this book were stunningly shocking, anything about Rasputin for example. The author did an incredible job of giving a fair account of all that happened to bring down the autocracy in Russia. I had heard all of the rumors regarding Anastasia before, but now feel I have the final word on all of it. There is no way she could have lived through it - read it for yourself, you won't be dissapointed. A long read, but I am slow and even I got through it."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I just finished reading this masterpiece. It is absolutely incredible. Massie is one of the few authors who present the last of the Romanovs in a objective light. He neither accuses or exalts Tsar Nicholas. He just presents the facts in the most detailed manner, but never tedious, and leaves it up to the reader to judge. By far, the best book written on the Tsar and his family."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"As one of the reviews below said, it is almost 'written like a novel'.

However, the intrigue, drama, action and romance in the book have changed my idea of learning history.

It makes clear all of the mistakes both Nicholas and Alexandra made, without whitewashing them or denying their existence, and yet at the same time makes them, as private individuals, completely sympathetic and understandable. In an era when we think it important to know every single thought in the head of a political figure, it is also a very revealing look at what it is actually like for a human being to have to maintain political rule while carrying an agonizing personal burden."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This wonderful book has thought me so much. The fate of the Russian Imperial Family is one that is known the world over. And, it is so that I find myself utterly and completely capivated by them. Even and the mystery/hope begins to fade that Anastasia or any of her sibling survied the massarce, I still find myself completey emerged in the gliter and spectale of their lives, and their hurrendous and gresome deaths. This book allowed me to see the entire family as a whole. Nicholas was a man I came to revere. He loved his country deeply and did what he believed best, which saddly enough was not. It is upsetting to see the unfair hand history has dealt this loving father and husband andlast tsar of Russia. Alexandra was a woman I questioned. She always appeared so remote and obessive. Yet, after reading the book I see her differently. I saw that she was a loyal and loving friend and mother.The Children, were a bit of a surprise. Olga, to my amazement wasn't the leader, she was instead a bit snobbish and direct. Tatiana, was different than I had imagined her. I always beloved she to be what in fact Olga was. Tatiana was indeed the &quot;Governess&quot;. Marie, was beauitful and just as a thrid child should be. Anastasia, good ole fat tutu. Oh, how funny it is that this seemingly unwanted girl, would be the one the world would know the best. Alexei, I had always believed to be utterly spoiled and a brat which in certain ways he was. Yet, I too see him in a new light, he was indeed darling and gracious and I sympathize with him and his terrible pain.I am sincerely glad I read this book. I would reccomend it to anyone with the slightest interest.It takes you beyond the doors of the palaces and prisons, and into the hearts and lives of all the characters in Nicholas's and Alexandra's court."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie's passion to find out all he can about his own son's blood disease gives him an understanding about the Royal family that few have noticed.

The patterns of their lives, particularly influenced by the tragic illness of their only son, and the mad monk Rasputin's effects on Russian politics as a result, produces an amazing story no novelist could invent. For an in-depth read of an era that helped define life today, this is an excellent book"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"In 2000, there was much talk about the \\"most important person of the 20th Century.\\" My choice was always Gavrilo Princip, the young Bosnian assassin who killed Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, igniting World War I, which caused the Russian Revolution, Communism, and the Treaty of Versailles, which led to Naziism, World War II, atomic bombs, and the Cold War.Of course, there were other factors which formed the tragedy of the twentieth century, and perhaps some of these historical events would have happened anyway. Almost for certain, the Romanov Monarchy would have fallen or been transformed out of recognition without the help of Gavrilo Princip's bullets.Although the Ottoman Empire was always referred to as \\"the sick man of Europe,\\" Robert K. Massie illustrates that Russia was not very well either, despite appearances. An obsolescent autocracy, the Russian Empire was mired in time at the dawn of the twentieth century, the great mass of its people existing much as they had 100 years earlier.Massie's theory, that the hemophilia of Alexis, the young Tsarevich, had an inordinate influence of Russian and subsequent world history, is well thought-out, though perhaps an oversimplification. Yet, it cannot be discounted. The Romanov Dynasty had ruled Russia then for 300 years, and brought the country, by fits and starts, slowly into the orbit of the modern world. Despite this, there is much truth in the observation that \\"Lenin inherited a nation playing beside a manure pile and Stalin bequeathed a nation playing with an atomic pile.\\" This is not to defend Stalinism, but only to say how little the Romanovs did overall to modernize their State.When Nicholas II inherited the throne after his father's untimely death, he was woefully unprepared to rule. Dominated for years by archconservative and anti-modernist members of his family, he did little to educate his people, provide health care, build infrastructure, or lift the heavy cloak of official repression that lay over all but ethnic Russians in his realm, or the cloak of cultural repression that lay over the ethnic Russians.Yet Massie shows us a man and a family of uncommonly kind nature in Nicholas II and his family. His daughter Olga paid personally for the care of a handicapped subject she spied from her carriage one day. The Tsaritsa, Alexandra, despite a reputation as an uncaring woman, herself nursed sick friends before the war and horribly wounded soldiers during the war. The family built hospitals and schools in and around the various cities wherein lay the royal estates. They acted to ameliorate suffering wherever they saw it, without reservation.Of course, this was the problem. They acted only on what they saw with their own eyes, never recognizing that these sufferings were endemic throughout the realm. Their myopia was part and parcel of the lives of the citified upper classes, completely divorced from the mass of agrarian peasants in the countryside, magnified by the hermetically sealed nature of being an Imperial Family, aided and abetted by sycophants and the self-serving, who kept the real world at a very long arm's length, in order to maintain their own privileged positions. Living in a bubble within a bubble, they were just not aware of conditions in most of Russia.Nicholas II ruled over the largest domain on earth. Russia today is still the world's largest nation, even shorn of Finland, Poland, the Baltic States, Belarus, the Ukraine, the Central Asian provinces, and (in 1867) Alaska. Sunset in Vladivostok was dawn in Brest-Litovsk. His hundred million subjects included hundreds of peoples speaking hundreds of languages, linked together by a shockingly small road and rail system. The sensitive Nicholas, had he been really cognizant of the shape of things, could have, by a single order, vastly improved the lives of each and every Russian (of course, as he noted, being an autocrat and giving orders does not ensure that they are carried out properly). His greatest failings, as a ruler, all had to do with his decisions to outwardly maintain his Imperial hautre and his autocracy at all costs in the face of cataclysmic change.This bubble-within-a-bubble existence however, could not spare them from the fact of the Tsarevich's hemophilia. A genetic disorder inherited through the female line (Alexis' Great-Grandmother was Queen Victoria, whose progeny were ravaged by the disease), it prevents the clotting of the blood. When Alexis was born in 1904, the world was a full lifespan away from the development of a usable clotting factor; most hemophiliacs simply bled out and died. The Tsarevich was protected by a full retinue, but this did not help him, and the boy was often in screaming agony and close to death from what might in another child, be a bad bruise. The Heir, therefore lived in a bubble within a bubble within a bubble.The Tsaritsa, Alexandra, was a solemn, shy, but deeply emotional and loving woman, nicknamed \\"Sunny\\" by her husband. To the world, she presented an aloof exterior, and was extremely unpopular with her subjects. Had they known the sorrows and agonies she suffered through with Alexis, her realm, and history, might have treated her far better. But the Imperial Family decided to keep Alexis' condition a closely guarded secret, fearing the destabilization of the Monarchy and Russia in the face of a physically frail Heir. This may have been the Imperial Family's worst error, as it robbed them of an outpouring of sympathy and support from a passionate populace.Alexandra turned to religion, and ultimately, to Gregory Rasputin, a filthy, degenerate, sexually perverse and personally dissolute monk of peasant extraction. Although derided by most, and called a charlatan by many, Rasputin was perhaps one of the most charismatic men in history, had a devoted following (largely comprised of Society women he'd seduced), did have the power, somehow, to control Alexis' bleeding episodes, and therefore, had the Empress's full and unwavering support in all things.The feared and hated Rasputin may have indeed been a seer or had mystical powers of some sort, judging from circumstances. Rasputin was not really political, but as his influence over the Romanovs grew, his power expanded commensurately, and he was able to have Ministers dismissed, Generals reassigned to sinecures, and policies changed according to his own whims (expressed as messages from God) or concerns. Capable Russian leaders, who did not know the basis of Rasputin's power, suspected the worst of Alexandra, and in challenging Rasputin found themselves toppled from power. As World War I dawned, Russia was upside-down, its best men in internal exile, and woefully unprepared for war. Rasputin himself counseled against war, stating that Russia would collapse from within. Nonetheless, the British, German and Russian grandsons of Queen Victoria went to war.In that war, millions died, empires fell, nations were born, ideological political systems triumphed, and the stage was set for a darker and yet bloodier future.The Tsar and his genteel family were consumed, ending their days against a wall before a Bolshevik firing squad, probably not understanding, until the end, that they had been in the eye of a hurricane that remade the world."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I have read this book many times and love it more every time I read it. Massie captures the times of Nicholas and Alexandra wonderfully. Massie captures Nicholas's and Alexandra's personalities and temperments wonderfully. Nicholas did not have the capability to rule over Russia and made huge mistakes. It did not help that some of these bad descisions were egged on by Alexandra. You feel Alexandra's grief over Alexei's hemophilia. She mourned it even more because this was their only son and heir. This was kept secret from the Russian people and most of the court and was disasterous. Massie gives a sympathetic light to the last tsar and tsarina, but doesn't leave out what went wrong."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I was sorry when I reached the book's last page since I couldn't get enough of Massie's narrative of the lives of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, his soulmate Tsarina Alexandra, and their five children. Martyrs, royals, intellectuals and, above all, simple human beings who passionately loved life, I was amazed and motivated by their tale."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"The thing that kept me awake nights while reading this book years ago were the vivid and terrifying descriptions of Rasputin. Massie paints him as a hypnotic, evil, controlling mystic who drives a gigantic wedge between Nicholas and his wife.And the scene where Rasputin is killed - only goes further to add to the myth of his super-human capabilities. Rasputin scared me to death and I still shudder when I think of him now. He is not a major part of the story - but he's in it and can't be ignored."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"After a recent visit to St. Petersburg, I became interested in learning more about the end of the Romanov dynasty and picked up this book on my return. I found it to be not only very well-researched but also extremely readable. Massie brings the characters to life on the page and creates a vivid, moving portrait of Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra. This biography is most certainly not to be missed."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Why go for fiction when you can get a riveting true story like what happened to the Romanovs? The book starts with Nicholas' unexpected coronation as Tsar in 1894, and slowly but surely the story unfolds towards the gruesome end 25 years later. The saddening thing about this episode in history is that despite Rasputin, despite the heir Alexis with his hemophilia, despite the Empress' foilies, I left the book believing that the Tsar and his whole family got killed because he was just too kind and humble to make the tough decisions that Russia required during those turbulent times. If you consider Stalin, a cynic may argue that evil pays."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert K. Massie's book is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. The beginning of the book quite honestly reminded me of a Monet or some other french impressionist painting in brilliant spring shades of pastel - the childhood of Nicholas II was so elegantly described. The romance between Nicholas and Alexander was rendered something we all wish for. Then, shades of grey and brown began to creep into the picture as Nicholas was thrust onto the throne 'ahead of schedule' and subjected to the manipulations of others when trying to sort out the distant eastern border.So riveting was Massie's style that I was catapulted into horror as for the first time, I read a gripping account of how WWI broke out - and appalled at the absolute STUPIDITY behind that. Yet through it all, Massie continues to paint a picture of a leader whose only flaw was he was a kind and gentle man with a deep love for his wife. Yeah, I am sure you could say plenty about the mistakes Nicholas II made - and I am sure you can say plenty about the mistakes all other leaders have made during times of trouble, but Nicholas would have been a fine leader if he hadn't been destined to be Tsar in troubled times. Massie's depiction of the other events which led to the demise of the Romanov's is eqully gripping, giving one an overall appreciation of all the factors which contributed to the collapse of the Russian Empire -something which they don't appear to have totally recovered from in nearly 100 years...My only complaint (and hence the 4 stars not 5) was Massie really just described the historically accepted points of view and didn't mention some of the contradictions and facts which go against the sensationalised story. I found this occurred particularly with Rasputin, and because I questioned the facts surrounding Rasputin, you can't help but wonder what other little details he left in the life of Nicholas and Alexandra. However, that aside, this is such a beautifully written historical biography, that missing facts or not, most of it is true and this book should be read by everyone just to gain a clearer picture of one of the truly more dynamic and mysterious bits of history in the timeline of humanity!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I can hardly add to the previous insightful review, but wanted to put in my proverbial two cents' worth. Though I have many books on the subject of Nicholas and Alexandra, I always return to Robert Massie's extraordinary text.

Besides those couple things I thought Russia was a pretty screwed up place that attracted wackos and extremists. I needed to learn.I initially found Robert Massie's book The Romanovs and was immediately drawn into his writing style - very easy to read, very descriptive - and discovered in the reviews that The Romanovs was more or less the follow-up to Nicholas and Alexandra so I checked it out, too. By the time I had read the preview chapters online I knew I wanted this book. I bought it, anxiously awaited its arrival and immediately started reading it!The only reason it took me as long as it did to read (I would have had it read in a weekend) was because I had other things to do and I made myself leave the book at work for lunch-time reading. Over the course of reading I learned about Russian politics, Russian geography, learned that there was a war between Russia and Japan around the turn of the century (a fact everyone I talked to thought was simply fascinating since nobody had ever heard about it) and learned about what went down in the months, weeks and days before the declaration of war in 1914. This book gives you a little taste of everything!If you want to learn about the Romanovs, about Russian, about WWI, about Rasputin, about Alexei that read this book! My only wish was that I knew more about the Bolsheviks and Soviets so that I had a better understanding of the revolutionist point of view and what their hopes were (my only understanding of Lenin after reading this book was that he wanted world revolution and he was a Marxist. I think I need to do more reading.) =^)Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Had owned this book years ago, but it got misplaced. Glad to have it back again. Massie is a great author, and brings clarity and reason to the events that unfolded in Russia at the turn of the century. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie has a wonderful historical narrative style. Right now I am going through all his works: PETER THE GREAT, NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA, THE LAST OF THE ROMANOVS. Great reading. Finally I am getting my head around just who the Romanovs were and it is fascinating."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"'Nicholas and Alexandra' is a thorough history. It has an impressive Bibliography with a lot of primary source material listed and the end notes meticulously cite the source references. One would usually expect such a book to be dry, dusty and dense but this one reads like a novel. Massie has a very easily fluid way of expressing himself and his prose is rich. Not only are his descriptions very visual, he is often able to communicate the atmosphere and tensions of the times and events. There is only one chapter where I found the writing got a bit slow and uninteresting (perhaps Massie didn't find this part of the story interesting himself), but I say that one out of thirty-four ain't bad.My only quibble with the book is a minor one: frequently, Massie deals with one aspect of the history and then goes on to some other related topic. This necessitates a number of jumps back and forth in the chronology and, while it is not a bad way to tell the story, I found it threw me off ever so slightly at times and I had to go back to see what period was being discussed. It wasn't a major problem, at all, but maybe the jumps could have been a bit more deftly handled.I found it interesting that Massie never yielded to temptation to speculate whether any of the supposed victims of the slaughter at the Ipatiev house actually survived and whether any of the claimants to being Anastasia or the Tsarevich were telling the truth. He flatly states that the entire party were killed on the spot and their bodies mostly destroyed before whatever was left was thrown down a mineshaft. This was essentially the finding of an investigation conducted not long after the events, but the findings concerning the disposal of the bodies were later called into question in The file on the THE FILE ON THE TSAR THE FATE OF THE ROMANOVS - DRAMATIC NEW EVIDENCE published in 1976. Massie published 'Nicholas and Alexandra' in 1967 so he was obviously not able to draw on the later theory and investigation, nor could he have had the benefit still later forensic findings that proved pretty conclusively that the Tsar and all his immediate family were indeed all killed (and thus the claims of so-called survivors all false) and which also established the eventual fate of the remains. Rather ironically, Massie himself later came to document this investigation in his bookThe Romanovs: the Final Chapter. ... also an excellent read."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I am little late to the game when it comes to being intrigued by Russian history - it just happened one day. My first thought was to read about the Romanovs, and due to the excellent reviews on Amazon for this book, I ordered it and devoured it within a few short days. This book reads like a novel, fast paced and absorbing. These names I have heard spoken for years finally came to life on these pages. Its a must read for anyone interested in Russian history. The follow up written by Masse is also excellent."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"But there are a few errors in it. For example, Massie states that Nicholas was 13 when his grandfather Alexander II died when actually he was a couple of months shy of his 13th birthday. Massie also says that Queen Victoria approved of the marriage when it is very obvious through her letters that she did not. The Queen had nothing against Nicholas personally, but felt that the Russian throne was very unstable and didn't wish her granddaughter to be a part of it. There are a few other mistakes, but overall it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is a romantic novel and very hard to put down.

I felt I was given a good image of what life was like in the time period in which Russia's monarchy was coming to an end. Despite getting a numerous amount of facts it didn't feel like I was reading the typically boring history book.i also got a feel of what it is for someone to have hemophelia, their youngest and only son had it."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Once started, I could not put this book down. It gives the big picture...the end of Russian imperialism and the birth of communism...and then it brings it down to the personal tragedy of the imperial family. I found myself grieving for them and wishing that they could have somehow survived. A thousand \\"what ifs\\" crossed my mind as I read this book. What if the tsarevich had not been hemophilic...what if another country could have offered the imperial family asylum and had provided them with a way of getting out of Russia before they were murdered.....what if the tsar would have been more in touch with the common Russian people.....what if the tsarina could have been more rational about her son's illness and about the insanity of allowing Rasputin to interfere in her husband's government. This book touches all the bases and made a confirmed Romanov fan out of me."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I found this book to be the best narrative of Russian history that I have read.

A lot of history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I knew next to nothing about the end of the Russian Romanov dynasty until I read this extremely well written and researched, enlightening and (yes) entertaining book. Russia is a dot-connector, and if you are to understand history properly, you must know something about Russian history. This book is a page-turner and ranks up there with the greatest of mysteries and intrigues - and soap operas!! Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra, were NOT very bright people, and they easily were played like pawns in the bringing down of Imperial Russia by the unscrupulous behind-the-scenes Soviet string pullers. I would go so far as to say that the Empress Alexandra might have been borderline insane, and her naive husband deferred to his borderline insane wife unknowingly. At the very least, Alexandra's selfish desperation at holding onto her own powerful position via her only son is made quite apparent. A very sad tale about the naivete of the last of the Russian tsars."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book filled in many blanks that I had about the end of the Tsars.

For example where and how the Tsar and family were killed, as that information only became available at a later date."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I'm about three quarters of the way through. I've always been curious about this time in Russia and this book really lets you know these people intimately. The war details were a bit long for my taste but that's just me. Very good book: well written and informative."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is generally considered to be the definitive biography of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra. Massie's expert storytelling is well-suited to the compelling story of the last Russian tsar and his consort. The history of Russia was no doubt changed by the deliberate myopia and general inadquacies of these two people. Nevertheless, Massie manages to uncover a more sympathetic side to the ill-fated duo. Massie's writing is as good as that of any acclaimed novelist - there's a fascinating and fastpaced plot, finely nuanced lead characters, an intriguing supporting cast, all against a beautiful background of a majestic bygone era.This book was researched and written before the fall of the Soviet empire when the state archives were opened and new information about the Romanovs was revealed. Consequently, this book is necessarily incomplete, especially as concerns the execution of the royal family. Massie has since written another text called &quot;The Romanovs: The Last Chapter&quot; which devels deeply into the newly available data and the forensic studies that followed. Consider it an essential volume II to &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I started a love affair with European royalty while in junior high, and as luck or fate would have it, Robert Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra was published during this time. I was bitten by the Romanov bug and have suffered from this malady ever since.Nicholas and Alexandra, the last Tsar and Tsarina of Imperial Russia, came from a distinguished royal pedigree. Nicholas was the son of Tsar Alexander III, and his aunt was Princess Alexandra of Wales. Alexandra was a Hessian princess and granddaughter of Queen Victoria. As youngsters, they fell in love and \\"Nicky\\" knew that \\"Alix\\" was fated to be his bride. Theirs was a true love match at a time when royal marriages were arranged for any reason but love.Two events conspired to cause the Romanov tragedy. First, Nicholas was not a very strong-willed man. He let others dominate him (including his wife). When his father died suddenly at the age of 49, the young Nicholas was totally unprepared and untrained to be Ruler of all the Russia's. Second, Nicholas and Alexandra were very family oriented, and it was a crushing blow when their 5th child and only son was born with hemophilia. In desperation, they alienated much of Russia (to protect this secret) and fell under the harmful influence of Rasputin. Russia was ripe for revolution, and Nicholas and Alexandra were too blind to see what was happening in their own country until it was too late.Massie does a stellar job of bringing Russian history to life in a way that reads like a novel. He also writes with a passion born of experience. When his son was born with hemophilia, Massie started researching how hemophilia affected the royal houses of Europe-especially the Romanov's. He details not just Russian history, but the history of this dreaded disease including various types of hemophilia, treatments, new advances, etc. The only negative about this book is in the timing. Massie wrote what was known in the late 1960's. But since the fall of communism and perestroika, we now know so much more about what happened to the Imperial family. Massie took this new information and finished the story in The Romanov's: The Final Chapter. One book should not be read without the other.Nicholas and Alexandra is one of my favorite nonfiction books, and I find myself rereading it every five to six years or so. I enjoy it just as much with each subsequent reading. My original paperback was in such tatters that I finally treated myself to a new hardback copy. Even after all these years, the tragic fate of the Romanov's continues to haunt us."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie's work is very readable; more like a novel than a biography. There were times I couldn't believe some of the intimate details could be real, for how would Massie know? But at the back of the book he has extensive notes indicating the sources for all the details including diaries and memoirs. I thought Massie did an excellent job illustrating the roots of World War I, especially the relationship between Nicholas and Kaiser William II. Also excellent was the way he makes the enigma of Rasputin understandable and how he reconciles the public disfavor and lack of understanding of the tsar and his wife with their noble intentions with the good of Russia in mind. In reading history it is easy to imagine that the participants were ignorant or oblivious to larger trends that would envelop them, especially in light of subsequent historical events. Massie's story brilliantly sheds light on the story of the last tsar such that the reader can genuinely understand the motivations of most of the participants. Very enlightening reading. I strongly recommend the book for anyone interested in Russian history or just looking for a readable story."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Most book lovers have a little list of super-favorites that they turn to year after year, and this classic by Robert Massie has been on my list for more than two decades. Massie brings the last years of the Russian Imperial court to astounding life, turning meticulously researched detail into a tapestry more compelling than fiction. You feel you've been there and met the Romanovs and the people around them, walked their halls, ridden in their trains, even faced their final terrors. Its as good as stepping into a time machine. How many times have I looked up from this paperback (I've gone through several copies over the years) and found that I've lost track of time. Recently, several lavishly illustrated books have come out with long-hidden photos of what NICHOLAS &amp; ALEXANDRA describes -- gorgeous though those photo books are, they do not give you as powerful a sense of time and place as Massie's exceptionally readable prose. Details of Russian history, which could be ponderous for most readers, become lively and engrossing here. I love history, and no book in the genre pulls me back as often (or with as much satisfaction) as Massie's NICHOLAS &amp; ALEXANDRA."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"When this book first appeared in 1967, nothing anything like it had ever existed before. There were the original emigr&eacute; accounts, most of them written in the 1920's and 1930's, which contained personal memories of the last tsar and his family from many points of view. There were the other historical sources which gave, for example, descriptions of Russian and European society in the time of Nicholas II, along with depictions of the cataclysmic events of war, revolution and regicide. The real brilliance of Robert Massie's &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; lies in the fact that he was able to weave these far-flung historical narratives into an intensely readable and informative whole, in the process resurrecting the last tsar and his family from the murky mists of time which had made them all but vanish from the attention of the world. A whole Romanov industry exists today, producing several new books on this tragic family every year. The public's fascination with this field, however, must surely be traced back to Massie's astonishing &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra.&quot; It is a work of nearly faultless scholarship, fidelity to historical sources, and deeply moving human interest. It is unthinkable that one should let one's life pass by and leave this book unread. Get yourself a copy, loan it if you must, but don't ever let it stray forever from your shelves. It's that good."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Like a number of other reviewers, this is one that I set down and read about every three or four years. It is that delightful! I normally like my history a little more \\"hard core\\" but this work is an exception. It reads more like a novel than most biographies, yet is simply loaded with facts concerning the last Russian Tsar and his family. The book was of course written several years ago and new facts concerning this royal family and their country during this time period have come to light since that time. This is not a distraction in the least. A good story, well told, is still a good story and the author did quite well with in information available to him at that time. This work did, like other reviewers, strike a spark and interest in Russian history that has lead to much good reading since I first read it. For that I am grateful. Highly recommend this to any one who is not only interested in history, but for anyone interested in just a good human story.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is not a \\"history book\\" so if you're seeking a remedy for insomnia, try somewhere else. You won't find dry, soulless lists of dates and facts or be patronized with tedious analyses of cause and effect. Nor will you be handed summary value judgments regarding each individual's contribution to history.You will instead be taken into the confidence of the Romanovs and hear their story as it would be told by a dear friend of the family. Massie, himself the father of a hemophiliac, writes with a touching sympathy toward Tsar Nicholas, Empress Alexandra, and their son, Alexis, who suffered from hemophilia all of his tragically short life. Ample quotations from personal letters and diaries portray each character with the sort of intimacy and detail one expects in a well-written, character-driven novel.The book is paced in a manor that keeps the interest of the reader. Dramatic events like the beer riot at Nicholas's coronation or the assassination of Rasputin are described in clear, stark detail that makes them memorable enough to be retold by the reader. Historical events tangential to the Romanov story, like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, are told quickly but thoroughly. The story is kept firmly in historical context without being drowned out by historical events.Massie shows a movie director's ability to choose vivid, emotional images. I can almost see the hazy, orange cast to the scenes of little Alexis in his soldier's uniform charming all of the officers into joining in his games. I can imagine Alexandra reaching a pale, thin hand out of a train window. She accepts a proffered cornflower from one of her captors as the train begins to move, taking the disgraced family to Siberia. My mental movie screen fades to black before showing the bleak, dilapidated house that would be the family's prison.The beauty of this book, however, is its unique presentation of the people involved. Nicholas and Alexandra come to life as undeniably good, and yet tragically flawed, human beings. More surprisingly, their family and its difficulties are entirely relatable. Nicholas's struggle to choose between his own judgment, his uncles' advice, his Mother's urgings, and his wife's effusively expressed opinions makes him a sympathetic \\"everyman\\" despite his wealth and power. And no author could create a character more colorful than Alexandra. Her blind acceptance of Rasputin's self-described holiness and her incessant meddling in politics make her an unwitting villain in the story. However, one can only admire her sincere faith and devotion to country and family. Unwilling to sit in luxury while Russia was at war, she and her daughters became nurses, braving the filth and stench to help the wounded men. The reader cannot help but sympathize with her, despite feeling a measure of contempt at her naivet&eacute;.The main antagonist of the story is the infamous Rasputin. As I read about this rough, unwashed peasant and his rise to power, I frequently checked the spine of the book to verify that I was indeed reading a work of \\"nonfiction\\". Everything about the man, from his mysteriously hypnotic gaze to his inexplicable power over the Empress, belongs in the realm of fantasy fiction. His ability to ease the suffering of little Alexis can be explained by hypnotism, a psychological phenomenon that is much more understood today than it was when the book was written. However, the spell he cast over Alexandra and many of the other nobles defies reason. The passages about Rasputin, all rigorously documented, add a touch of surrealism to this drama that will fascinate those of us who delight in the unexplained.The chief weakness of this work is its all-too-brief treatment of Lenin, the ultimate nemesis of Tsarism and of the Romanov family. It can certainly be argued that the life of Lenin belongs in a different book. However, Massie's brief passages about Lenin were so well written and intriguing that I wished there were more. If Rasputin is a fairy-tale black mage, Lenin is a comic book supervillian- brilliant, ruthless, and bitter. Moreover, Nicholas and Lenin provide for the perfect juxtaposition. It is quite easy to feel affection for the Tsar who loved his country more than his crown and his family more still. At the same time, Nicholas's neurotic unwillingness to assert himself and spectacularly poor judgment make him an object of pity. Lenin, in contrast, is cold and clever. One cannot help but admire his Machiavellian machinations while detesting him personally.This entirely true story is more entertaining than many works of historical fiction. Whether you are a fan of drama, intrigue, war, fantasy, history, or romance, you will find something to keep you turning the pages. It is unusual to find a book that could be recommended to so broad an audience."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"\\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" was truly captivating. The vivid imagery sweeps one back to the final days of Imperial Russia; of balls, galas, war, revolution, an finally murder. Massie takes the stand, and with his words we relive one of the most mysterious, yet emotional struggles of early 20th century Russian history.The way the book is written gives both the perspectives of a government in decay, complete with the political circumstances and key political figures of the time. However, the book often drifts off through the snow covered capital of St. Petersburg, to the ice cold walls of the Alexander Palace, where Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra became simply Nicky and Alix. In their private world at Tsarskoe Selo, the titles of \\"Their Imperial Majesties the Grand Duchess\\" and the Tsaravich simply became those names of children, from Olga to Alexis.From these days at the Alexander Palace, Massie brought us up close to not only the Tsaravich's struggle with hemophilia, but also the struggle of a mother, Alexandra, whom had to bare it all, side by her son. In this came in the, in my opinion, intolerable abomination of a man the world knows as Rasputin.The way Massie wrote of the influence of Rasputin on her Majesty the Empress Alexandra, and hence the influence on government, which led to the collapse of Imperial Russia, one clearly sees the faults that are shown within the Empress and her ineptitude to run an empire. However, at the same time, one feels for her and pays special attention to her religious beliefs, which influence much of the final outcome of her greatest mistake.Finally, Massie depicts the final collapse of Imperial Russia on a swift day. This eventually leads to the imprisonment and final execution of the last Tsar, Autocrat of All the Russians, and his family. The breathtaking detail and account of their murder is extremely unsettling. One may think that reading of simply a murder, one of many, is not so great a shock, yet, as one has read this book from the very beginning, one has gotten to know, personally, the Imperial family, and cannot help but pity them.This book is a great resource for one that has just become interested in this tragic episode of European History, or simply for one who wishes to learn more of this \\"Love that Ended an Empire\\"."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is a sensitive narration of the life and death of Russia's last Tsar and his tragic familly. Massie writes clearly and eloquently and succeeds in bringing his characters to life and developing a genuine empathy with them.Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra emerge as rather sad and pathetic characters, out of touch with reality and hopelessly unqualified for the role thrust upon them. Massie's fascinating thesis is that the Russian revolution may have been brought about by a haemophilia gene passed along from queen Victoria. That is probably an extremely romanticised view of history. A more likely truth is that the tragic end of Tsarist Holy Russia was an accident waiting to happen. A fragile system built on fragile people. That fragility more than anything else is what comes across from reading these pages."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert K. Massie's account of the last days of tsarist Russia is intelligently written. Even if one is not historically inclined, one will automatically find onself drawn to this tragic tale. The book is so desciptive that one is almost lead to believe that Massie himself witnessed every event. If I must add any criticism of the book, it would be that Massie overestimates the the influence that Rasputin had on the fall of the Imperial government. It is true that Rasputin helped hasten the government's downfall , but it would have fell nonetheless due its subjection to a weak ruler and his neurotic wife. In all fairness, I must say that this minor point is not enough to dissuade me from giving it five stars. It is a must read for all those who love history, especially Russian history!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is a long book. At the same time, I couldn't put it down. It not only tells an unbelievable story of the Romanov family, it delves into the origin of the Soviet Union. It is an incredible biography, novel, history book and political science treatise all rolled up in one book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is the book that led to a addiction and a library of over one hundred books on Imperial Russia. The shock that the whole world let this gentle loving family fall in the hands of Lemin and the results of their murder is unbelievable.I hope that one day I can have this book on my kindle 2 as it is my favorite book on the subject."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is an all-encompassing authoritative biography of the last ruling Romanovs, and Massie has compiled a thorough and well-researched insight into the lives of Nicholas and Alexandra. Even forty years after its original publication and long after the fall of the Soviet Union, it is a relevant part of Russian history. Massie is very sympathetic in his presentation of the royal family and addresses pertinent questions about the fall of the monarchy. If Alexis, the heir to the throne, had not had hemophilia, would the influence of Rasputin not have been necessary? And if Rasputin were never in the picture, would the monarchy have suffered such a tarnished reputation?The book painted a very vivid picture of the Royal Family based on hundreds of sources and letters. Nicholas is an incapable Tsar but a warm-hearted, devoted husband and father. Alexandra seems frantic and ill at ease (and often just ill) in her constant concern over the life of her son. And I love that I felt I got to know each of the children, Olga, Tatiana, Marie, Anastasia, and Alexis more individually and personally. This made their demise all the more heartbreaking. This book also gave me a greater understanding of the political climate of the time in Russia and a better comprehension of the revolution and the roles of Lenin, Trotsky, and other important players (although I occasionally found some difficulty keeping the various Russian names straight). Overall, this is a captivating book and the saga is all the more intriguing because it's history. I will definitely be interested to read some of the more recent material that Massie presents in The Romanovs: The Last Chapter."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I read this book many years ago and have never forgotten it, and I just recently purchased a copy of my own. Robert Massie is an excellent writer who makes this book memorable for the fun and loving family that the Romanovs were and their terrible, tragic end. I'm now collecting more books on the Romanov dynasty and the individual people who made up this fascinating family. For anyone with an interest, this is the place to start."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert Massie's \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" is a biographical study centered on the lives of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia. Massie's portrayal of the last ruling Romanavs is like many other works on the subject in that it is poignant, dramatic, and vibrant; but never dull. However, Massie's work stands out above other works on the subject for its thorough account of the lives of the imperial couple and most of all, its sympathetic portrayal of them.Nearly all works of the period agree that Tsar Nicholas II was not the blood-drenched despot the Bolshevik revolutionaries claimed him to be, and although he may not have been as benevolent as his contemporary Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary, he at least lacked the bellicose nature of his German counterpart (and early advisor), Wilhelm II. Massie's account demonstrates how Nicholas II was ill-prepared to ascend the throne in after Alexander III, but unlike the contention of other historians, Massie makes a reasonable case in defending the intelligence of the fallen autocrat.Massie's account of Nicholas and Alexandra does not absolve the couple from their failure to prevent the collapse of the reign and ultimately their country, but it does partially excuse their inflexibility and fatalism on the serious of misfortunes that continued to plague Nicholas from the very day of his coronation; when hundred of Russian peasants were stampeded to death in a overzealous crowd on Khodynka Meadow. Yet, no Romanov apologist can ignore the detrimental influences on Nicholas's reign, including his wife Alexandra, a German Kaiser, and especially a corrupt starets. That such an array of persons from various strata of society could at times impose their will on a man raised to be an autocrat was a tarnish on Nicholas' character.Despite his habit of being easily swayed at times, Nicholas is not one-dimensional in Massie's account. It is noted how Nicholas ignored the advice of able ministers and most of all; remained unyielding to grant the masses of his subjects the representation and constitution they desired--until it was too late. Even Massie can be counted among the historians who muse whether the Romanov dynasty might have survived had the Tsar been more accommadating to the popular demands of his people--or if war had not erupted in the manner it did in 1914.Although Massie's work is very thorough, it only briefly touches the clandestine operations of the Tsarist police state in rooting out revolutionaries and assassins from its masses prior to 1917. Indeed, other works (e.g. Edmond Taylor's \\"The Fall of the Dynasties\\") are careful to point out that Tsarist police included a host of known double agents whose loyalties were perpetually in doubt. While Massie makes note of that insecurity in his account of Prime Minister Peter Stolypin's assassination in 1911 by a Tsarist agent, he fails to explain how widespread the problem actually was. Indeed, Taylor describes as monarchy's slide to collapse as a \\"suicide\\", not because they were unable to stop that slide, but rather because they were unwilling.Just as it is difficult to excuse the corrupt system of Tsarist counter-revolutionary activity, historians are also unable to justify the Russia's policy in WWI of placing the needs of France above that of her own. The disaster at Tannenburg early in the war is described in detail by Massie, and is correctly portrayed as a premature offensive launched by Russia (with the support of Nicholas) to rescue its beleagured ally from the German onslaught through northern France. Indeed, even after his abdication and arrest, Massie notes how Nicholas pleaded with Kerensky to continue to support the Russia's allies in the war effort--a mission with which the Provisional Government leader would complete in the summer of 1917 with disastrous consequences. Although Massie's \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" does not outright label the monarchy as a principle agent of its own destruction, his book nevertheless provides a strong case to the conclusion that the last rulers (and their ministers) of the Romanov dynasty practiced an inexplicable policy of self-immolation.It is perhaps this mystery--or lunacy--of the Romanovs that continues to fascinate so many readers 90 years after their unglorious deaths in their Siberian imprisonment. Undoubtedly, the story of the last Romanovs will continue to perplex students of history for decades to come, and Robert Massie's work will will remain the foremost account of the twilight of Imperial Russia."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is an extremely well written book, as has been said before almost reads like a novel.

For anyone interested in Russian History, The Romanovs, First World War or the rise of communism this is a must read."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"\\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" is a fantastic history book that I can thoroughly recommend to all readers. The book is truly \\"unputdownable\\" and if it were not a history book, it could almost have read as a novel.The end of the Romanov dynasty is a work of tragedy. Here we have this closely bound intimate family playing out a drama against the backdrop of the First World War and the Russian Revolution. Yet tragedy almost becomes farce when the role of Rasputin is considered. The Czarina is quite spellbound by the man despite the damage that his decisions have for the family and the dynasty.In \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\", we see the unfolding of the downfall of autocracy which, in due course, would have been inevitable. The First World War simply accelerated the process. Yet while we should shed no tears for the fall of autocrats, the rise of an even more vile autocracy under Lenin heaps tragedy upon tragedy. The history of modern Russia is tragedy writ large.Robert K Massie covers the events leading to the execution of the royal family in great detail but without ever deluging the reader with arcane facts that detract from the picture that he paints. The end result is a work of substance and colour.I emphatically recommend this book to all readers of modern history. Robert K Massie has excelled!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"The story of Nicholas and Alexandra has all the elements of a great novel: complex characters, plot twists, and an exciting conclusion. But, it's all true. Robert Massie wrote this history in 1967, but it is still relevant to today. In these days of democracy, it is enlightening to learn about the times when monarchy and autocracy were the words of the day. Robert Massie's book is excellently written. It is consistently clear, and at all times a pleasure to read. The biography has a wide scope, it covers just about everything relating to the Tsar and the Tsaritsa from the time of their marriage to the time of their death. You don't often see biographies of two people in one book. But to understand Nicholas, you must understand Alexandra. And, by the end of this book, you will have a better undserstanding of why events played out the way they did."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Oh my God! I picked up this book on a whim at the library ten years ago when I was ten, because our English teacher wanted us to read a book over 500 pages long, and this seemed fit enough. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Sespite having to struggle over difficult words and titles, I absorbed the book and found it excellent. A must read for anyone hoping to gather information on the Romanvos for a school report or just hoping to learn about the last Imperial family of Russia. You will never forget what you learn from this book, because Massie puts so much detail into this story, which is the product of years and years of research and late night working. I salute Mr. Massie for his superb book and I encourage any young person to forget anything that your big brother told you about &quot;boring history books&quot; and to read this, for I can assure you that is is NOT a boring history book! Cheers!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I just wanted to add to my previous review that Massie is a master at storytelling. The emotional abdication, the fear yet courage the Romanovs displayed during their captivity, Massie easily transports the reader back to Ekaterinburg on that fateful day. One wonders whether a time machine does exist, such skill that Massie has in related the final moments of the Romanovs as if he were actually there. Full praise for a great biographer!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Personal Background & Questions: After joining the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church in the mid 1990's & marring a Russian wife in the late 1990's, I needed to read a good informative biography about the last Czar Nicholas Romanov II to find out what historically happen to answer a few questions:Was Moscow the third Rome (a Christian Empire guarding the Christian Orthodox Faith: Rome fell in 410, Constantinople in 1453, & Moscow in 1917)? How did the Russian Empire fall? Is a Christian Theocracy still possible?Is Czar Nicholas II a Saint, was he an untrained prince turned single focus Tsar, or \\"Bloodly\\" Nicholas?Who was Rusputin? Was he a hedonistic heretic, a persecuted Staret, or a doubled face sinner/saint?Commentary: After finishing \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" by Robert K. Massie, most of these questions go unanswered, but at least my options are clarified. The book is very well written for easy reading, almost too well written...in some areas it reads like a novel: over detaining certain information that may not be historical fact. This Novel-ling of history deals mostly with the main characters: what they wear, what facial features or expressions they had. The words that may or may not of been spoken are colored with emotion which adds to the story, but is it history?Lets look at historical biographies this way:First, you have a biography that is a history book. It lists just the facts; this can be rather boring to read.Second, there are books like \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" that add a little favor to soften the read, or to act out the history.Third, there are books like \\"I Claudius\\" by Robert Graves that are fictional autobiographies: fictional writings with historical facts intertwined.Only you the reader know what type of books you may enjoy, or what you really what from a book. If you want to read a good story & get some history, then this may fit your fancy."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is the second book I've read by Robert Massie - the first one was Catherine the Great. He is a great writer. Takes one back to history, while providing the intrigue of a fictional story. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"A friend who knows I am not the biggest history fan suggested I read historical biographies by Massie. Accuracy of history and the facts were always a drudge in school, but this is a fun way to learn history.

I bought other Massie books and am looking forward to reading them all."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I became fasinated with Russian history after reading Peter the Great by Robert Massie, and thought I would try this book.

Mesmerizing glimpse at imperial russia and European royalty in general. If you want an easy read that also provides a lesson in history give it a go"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is one of the finest works of historical biography ever written. Massie takes a tragic love story and sets it against a fascinating time period in history. The love story of two shy people, on of whom happens to be destined to rule 1/6 of the globe is told with grace and style. But this is much more than a simple love story. Massie brilliantly covers the people and personalities of Imperial Russia with wit and grace. From Imperial grand dukes to the simple peasant who helped bring down an Empire, Massie never fails to hold your interest. The sad fate of the Romanovs makes this book all the more heart wrenching. The sad fact is that Nicholas was unfit to be Czar and as Massie points out would have made an excellent constitutional monarch such as his 1st cousin King George V. This is second only to the authors Peter the Great in my list of must read historical biograpies."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Russian history has always fascinated me. Robert Massie paintes an eloquent picture of the last Tsar. Excellent read,flows easily. My only gripe is the number of typos and syntax errors in the book."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book was suggested to me by a friend at a dinner party. As Russian history is not my typical area of interest, I had no idea what to expect. Little did I know.... This book is absolutely FANTASTIC. It reads quickly and clearly and has escorted me into further research on these figures and times. Not only is it a painfully incredible piece of history, it is an account of human fragility resulting in epic consequences."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Excellent story from begining to end! I was very interested in reading about the entire saga...learning about the Romanovs, the history and status quo at the time of Russia, what led up to the revolution and the whole entire tragedy,Once I set down to read it, I continued to read for hours, and hated to put the book down!Massie is a very good writer who knows how to put together an enthralling and interesting narrative that keeps the reader pondering about the tragic lives and ending of the Romanovs, and what led up to their demise, well after the reader has finished the book: )I will definitely pull this book out and read it again sometime."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"It is a beautiful book. The author transports the reader to the times of the Russian Tzars, with their passions and lifestyle. However, Nicholas and Alexandra add to their life time the gestation of a revolution, the end of centuries of traditions, believes, ways of living...It is their tragedy but more so the suffering of a country, the accurate picture of the people that were protagonists, good and evil, generous and selfish, ignorant ad educated of a major change that took places in a time that allows us today to evaluate its consequences in our own eye. The only thing that may make it less easy to read is too much politics, that unless you have a background that enables you to really situate them in the context, it becomes heavy at times. That is why I did not give it five stars, just four."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Though I've always wanted to read about the Imperialist Family of Russia, I never realized how interesting it would really be. It is safe to say that I have found a new obsession! Robert K. Massie has written a book that is impossible to put down, and if I did put it down, it was because I was talking about it to friends or family. Mr. Massie wrote an exceptionally well researched book without putting the reader off with technical details. The personalities of these people really came out and made me feel for what they went through. They weren't perfect people. Who among us is? They were a beautiful & loving family with a secret that forced them into some very bad decisions. Ultimately, the Romanovs loved Russia and wanted the best for the country that they ruled. As any parent knows, when you have a sick child, nothing else matters. Enter Rasputin who often brought the child back from the brink of death. The parents saw one side of Rasputin, and the world saw another. This is truly a case of being blinded by love, and not being able to see the bigger picture. If it is right to punish someone for that, then we are all in trouble! After having finished this book, I had already ordered two more by Robert K. Massie! AWESOME READ!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is an absolutely engrossing account of the story of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. The story begins with Nicholas, his early years, his eventual marriage to Alexandra of Hesse und bei Rhein (although here she is referred to as Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt); and covers their life together and the triumphs and failures of his reign as the last Tsar of all the Russias. The author's main thesis is that the downfall of the Romanov dynasty was the result of the haemophilia inherited by their son and heir, Alexis. After having produced four daughters and obviously not wanting to alarm the country that the heir to the Russian throne might not live long enough to actually reign, the Tsar and his family chose to close themselves off from the public and remain intensely private. Unfortunately this did not help their popularity at a time when the country was turning against them. Plus, because of the incredible pain of watching her son suffer, Alexandra turned to the mysterious Rasputin for help. Her reliance on him, a shady and immoral character, and his over-involvement in government turned the people further against them and their downfall became inevitable, as they could not explain Rasputin's presense for fear of acknowledging Alexis's haemophilia. Whether Rasputin really was the reason for the end of the dynasty, as Massie suggests, or just the catalyst remains to be discussed, but the story is still a fascinating one. The descriptions of life in Imperial Russia are beautiful and the tender story of the family's personal life is touching, but like many of the reviewers I found that the author has a particular soft-spot for the Tsar and therefore explains away many of his (and his wife's) very real mistakes. But the account of the last Tsar is so interesting for many reasons, not least of which is their tragic and horrifying end. This is a great book to begin a study of Russian history and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is a wonderful book for those who want to learn about the Romanov and their destiny. I thoroughly enjoyed it.K.N."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book was very intersting. I very much enjoyed cross-referencing some of the characters and places with pictures and maps online. This was one of my favorite things about this book. Some of the small details were hard to match, as the translation must have been difficult, but most of the characters and places were easily found on the internet. But all-in-all it was completely fascinating and gave me a new respect for Russia's history. Before this book I had little to no knowledge of Russian history, and now I wish I could see all of these places referenced in the book! It's heartbreakingly true, and can be somewhat hard to follow, but completely worth the effort to read!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book is an excellent and detailed history of the fall of the reign of the czar.

The book has been a very popular seller over the years. This popularity is well-deserved. It is an extremely readable and fast-moving book.The book reads like a novel and still adheres to a strict standard of all good histories. It does not travel off into the sensational speculation nor does the book engage in stereotyping to an unsual degree.

Although this is not a novelization, it reads like one. The author's own personal insights are fascinating (eg: what if such and such happened?). My only negative comment is that sometimes the author describes events that happen up to a certain point,then backtracks in the next chapter or even paragraph. Therefore, there is some repetition (especially about Rasputin's death). The book is fast paced, entertaining, and very humane. The quotes selected are fascinating, and funny. They bring a lot to the book. Well done, Mr. Massie!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert Massie has to be one of the most gifted writers in the field of history.

As always, Massie has a unique knack for bringinghistory to life through vivid descriptions and a very readable style."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"More than a history of a man and a period the love andfamily intrigue of Nicholas and Alexandra brings a humanface to an autocrat. Tzar Nicholas variously described as&quot;bloody&quot; and &quot;aloof&quot; faces the reader as possibly a weakman, but a loving husband and a devoted father. It is infact, this humanity of Nicholas that defeats him in hisdealings with political demands he is ill prepared tohandle.

Despite this drawback Russia's last Tsar was good-humored,decent, mild-mannered.He was loyal,affectionate toward his family.He lavished care and attention to his only son ,young Tsarevich,a haemophiliac.Last days of Romanov family spent under terrible agony particularly so for Tsarina.Constantly harassed,intimidated by the Bolsheviks ,with all hopes of escape from Russia failing ,it must have been an intensely frustrating and painful life.Why was destiny so cruel to the last of Romanovs?This will always remain a mystery.Family perished in the hands of Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg. What a gruesome end. For a long time ,Bolsheviks concealed this crime. Finally, Boris Yeltsin had the courage to acknowledge Soviet Union's guilt.I got the impression what happened in Russia[revolution,violence which succeded] stemmed from the disease of young Tsarevich.Had he been healthy, there would have been no Rasputin and revolution.Profiles of people like Kerensky , Rasputin , Lenin were interesting.Also the section on Russo- Japanese war.Curious to know more about Siberian mystic Rasputin . From where did he acquire supernatural powers? Did he go Himalayas or Tibet where we still have sages possessing mystical powers.unfortunately author does not satisfactorily address this point.This book a must reading for history buffs."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert Massey is a great write. I've always enjoyed his books."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"If you desire to view the oppressive nature of any form of autocratic rule as either a love story or if you feel nostalgic for the myth of Imperial Russia, this is the perfect book for you. If, however you are more interested in unvarnished realism, this book will disappoint you.In no way do I want to suggest that the Bolshevik Revolution was a good thing. But I do suggest that autocratic governments are often met with revolutions: such was the fate of both France and Russia. And it is his glossing over of most of the abuses committed by Nicholas and Alexandra that I find fault with Massie. For example, at no point does Massie even acknowledge that during WWI, one out of every three soldiers who were on the field fighting had no rifles but were ordered into battle with the order that as soon as any soldier near them was wounded, they were to take his rifle and fight on.This lack of concern for the peasant soldier, coupled by the sad generalship displayed by those autocrats who thought themselves supreme in all things is readily seen in the Battle of Tannenberg in which, though vastly outnumbered, the Germans killed 170,000 Russians whilst only losing 12,000 men. That battle lasted only a few days.... Massie also apparently buys into the myth that the peasants believed that if only the Tsar were aware of the fact that over 10% of the Russia peasantry had to resort to clemming (eating tree bark, grubs, etc.) that the Tsar would make it all better. Nicholas knew and did nothing. The peasants also knew and they did somethng: they insured the success of the Revolution. Finally, Massie's explanation of Alexandra's taking absolute control of the government as being caused by her son's illness and fear for her beloved Nicky just won't wash. Alexandra wanted to destroy any agency she thought would lessen autocratic power -- and this included both the Duma and the Church.If you want a more honest history of Nicholas and Alexandra, I recommendThe Rasputin File."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Title: Nicholas and AlexandraThis was an awful boring book. I feel that it was a waste of my money and I will never buy anything written by Robert Massie again."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book has such small printing that it is unreadable. I can't imagine Amazon letting this go on. I wound up getting the Kindle edition. Do not get the mass market edition."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Although well researched and rich in insights into the Romanovs' family life, the book is rather one-sided in its pursuit of the Tsar's rehabilitation in the eyes of history. Massie jumps out of his skin trying to find excuses for all the blunders the Tsar and the Tsarina are commonly blamed for, from the Japanese war, to the Bloody Sunday, to Rasputin. Yes, they were mere humans, and a loving family, but they had a JOB to do, and that was to rule Russia at one of the most critical point in that country's history, and they mostly failed at it. Unfortunately, the author attempts to convince us that the Romanovs were purely victims of tragic circumstance. While this may be said about many historical figures, this is not what I was interested in when I bought this book."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie represents the one of the worst tendencies in popular historical writing, namely the sacrifice of historical complexity in order to tell a pleasing story. Massie completely romanticizes the Romanov story, without devoting nearly enough attention to the fact that at the same time that the family was enjoying their time together in splendour, everyday Russians were suffering and dying as a result of their policies. The fact that some peasants may have been awed by the czar and his family does not tell the full story of the Romanovs' relationship to their subjects. There is a fascinating and complex story here; sadly, it is one that Massie neglects, choosing to make us feel &quot;like we were really there&quot; rather than giving any sense of the significance(s) of what he depicts."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I appear to be in the minority, but I have found this book really second rate. The writing is stilted, as if it were a poor translation from another language. Everything in the book is already very well known and I don't think Mr. Massie did any original research.A great disappointment."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I loved this book. It was well-written, interesting, and a real page-turner. I have recommended it to many of my friends. I didn't know I could be so interested in Russian history. This book has it all, intrigue, love, tragedy. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie's book is an unbelievable resource for anyone conducting research on the Romanov family. The book also provides an excellent picture of the forces at work behind the collapse of the autocracy, world war I and the rise of Bolshevism. It's also an interesting love story told through the letters of the Tsar and Tsarina. Regardless of why you may find yourself reading it, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Wonderful book. This book gives quite an exhaustive account of events and personalities in Russia in period of Nicholas II. I am Russian myself, and absolutely everything that I knew about this epoch and the Royal family is summarized in the book. Given that it was written before I was born, I could not get rid of the impression that parts of the history books that I learned from were compiled from this work by Robert Massie.The accessment of these events during the Soviet time, when the book was written, and nowadays are quite different, and I cannot stop admiring the discrete attitude of Massie and his unbiased evaluations of the personalities.Reads easily as a novel. While it is a great advantage, this is also the only bit of criticism that I can add. The book about Peter the Great is harder to straggle through, but it gives a better account of the historical period in general, whereas \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\", in order to preserve coherence and story line, concentrates on events in Russia only, assuming reader's familiarity with events and personalities abroad, as well as in previous periods of Russian history.Still, wonderful read."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"The story of Nicholas and Alexandra the last Tsar And Tsarina of Russia is one of the most Tragic love stories the world has ever known. Their glorious begining and their horrifying end, still continues to facinate thousands of people today. This book is like a journey back through time, taking you directly into the world of the Russian Imperial family. It's actually like you are living their lives day by day.Massie has done a wonderful job in depicting the life of Nicholas and Alexandra. The books text is well researched and easy to read. You can breeze from chapter to chapter with complete understanding of what you have read. The text is also well balanced between political aspects of their life as well as personal aspects. Some Romanov books are way to political and deal to much with the difficulties concerning government in Russia. The book stays on task and makes you want to keep reading.I could honestly not put the book down, it's really that good. It's so rich and well written. The only part of the book that can be misleading is the final chapter, when the family is actually executed. But that can be forgiven for when this book was originally written there was not alot of information avalible concerning their death. Massie makes up for this in his book THE ROMANOVS: THE FINAL CHAPTER, which is another must read. No Romanov library is complete without this book. to read it is to grasp a better understanding of Nicholas and Alexandra."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie certainly deserved the author of the month in thewinter 2000 page on the romanov website.This book is a remarkable study of the last Tsar, hisfamily and the Russia they ruled. It is the definitework in that it portrays Nicholas not only as Tsar ofall the Russias , but as the father, the husband, andthe family man.All these aspects are crucial if we areto understand the man himself and the steps he tookto command his great empire. It is an extremely fairwork, showing the Tsar's shortcomings as a ruler, but yetat the same time his humaness, his vulnerability fromhis own position.Massie has excelled himself with this book, and I highlyrecommend it to any reader seeking an introduction tothis most fascinating period of Russian history.There have been criticisms of this book stating that Nicholasand his reign should have been studied in the context of say, other rulers of the time. This is a granted point, but one I feelMassie achieves in his commentary of the world spectrum on thewhole particularly in the years 1905 through to the first WorldWar.To isolate the &quot;family man&quot; from the ruler is impossible -they were part of each other.So congratulations to Robert Massie, this book is a verygreat achievement!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"&quot;Bloody Nicholas&quot;. &quot;Alexandra the German&quot;. These and other epithets were used to descibe Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra, the last Tsar and Tsarina of Imperial Russia. However, Massie brings to light and to life, the personal, human side of both Nicholas and Alexandra and their families.With unusual and fascinating insight, the lives of Nicholas and Alexandra are explored in the context of their backgrounds, upbringings, experiences, and the very public role which birth had conferred upon them. The impact these influences had upon them personally and the resulting impact upon Russian and world history is laid out in a poignant, tragic tale which will leave only the most jaded reader unmoved.Massie's writing style makes you feel as if you were actually there listening to and observing the Imperial family. His sources include the letters between Nicholas and Alexandra, letters from them to members of their families, and the memoirs of people who knew them personally and/or worked with them closely, such as tutors, close friends, ambassadors, and government officials.The insights gleened from these sources portray not vicious, callous rulers concerned only with their selfish ends, but rather two well-meaning and personally kind people whose personalities, education and limited perspectives ill-suited them for the roles into which they were born. Add to this the impact of the then untreatable disease of hemophilia which afflicted their youngest child, their only son and heir to the Russian throne. This does not excuse them from the disastrous role they played in the fall of the Romanov dynasty, but rather helps us to understand why they acted as they did.One cannot read this work and come away without a profound feeling of sadness. The &quot;what if's&quot; string on endlessly, most tragically in the contemplation of their five innocent, young children who were brutally murdered along with their parents by the Bolsheviks because of hatred for their parents, and a merciless political desire to ensure the monarchy never returned.This work will appeal to many: to students of Russia, history, royalty, political science, public relations, and of course, those interested in a story of romance in a privileged, elite world."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Romanov.... that is a very powerful name... and yet, it is just a name, you were either born with it or you weren't... but for the simple fact of bearing this name, many people had to die... and yet it is just a name. It is a name that says POWER, LOVE, INTRIGUE, MYSTERY, ESCAPE, TRAGEDY.... but it is also a name that for Nicholas, Alexandra, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alexei meant FAMILY, and as a family they stuck together, through illness, war, infamy, and even death.This book tells an incredible love story, that could beat any novel out there, and proves that life is always more mysterious, magical but also more cruel than fiction. It portrays the Romanovs as a family, and gives you an insight on their lives, their thoughts, their letters, their friends and their sufferings. It also lets you take a peek at Tsarist Russia, its power, its magic, its fancies, its relations with other empires, and many other things.Robert Massie is an expert on this subject, and you can see that a lot of research went into creating this book.I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it is a bit outdated when it comes to the finding and retreaval of the bodies, but this is covered in a latter book by the same author.Highly recommended, especially is you like history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"From what I have read of the Russian Revolution, I believe that like the French Revolution before it, that it had been coming a long time. And the two have some similarities - both countries had monarchs who were isolated from what was really going on in their countries; both countries were going through massive social change; both were facing food shortages - in France due to rotten weather, and in Russia due to WWI; both countries were or had been involved in costly wars - the American Revolution in the French case and WWI, in the Russian. And in both cases, most of not all members of the royal families ended up dead at the hands of the Revolutionaries.Did the haemaphilia of the Tsarevich bring about the Russian Revolution as the Massie therorises here? I believe that it was definitely a factor that sped the process up. The refusal of the Russian royal family to admit that young Alexei had a serious problem, and the secretiveness which surrounding his illness certainly didn't endear the ordinary Russians to them. But it was just one factor in a raft of others that led to the Revolution. The other factors were that ordinary people lacked a voice in the governing of their empire; the ruthless repression of even the mildest dissent and the failure of Nicholas II to make much needed reforms. Oh and WWI, that was the tipping point.The whole story of Nicholas and Alexandra has all the trapping of great tragedy - you can just imagine Shakespeare writing a play about them. Here were a couple who loved each other, and meant well - but their blindness to reality brought about revolution and ultimately their deaths. The real tragedy was that their kids, who shared no blame, also died.I have read this book several times, and the writer really makes you sympathise with them. At the same time, you can see where they made mistakes - the continouous firing and hiring of ministers in the first years of WWI made me want to shake them. And allowing a guy who could barely read and write - Rasputin - to advise them on state matters, was the height of stupidity.Not that Raspution was stupid. He was smart enough to get ingratiate himself into the inner royal circle. He was smart enough to be able to manipulate the royal couple, and he clearly did have some influence on the Tsarevich and his illness, even if that influence was merely enabling the boy to calm down enough so that he could relax and heal. Raspution also clearly possessed charisma by the bucketload."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert K Massie's Nicholas & Alexandra is the story of not only the Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, but the story of the world in which they lived in - fin-de-siecle Europe. Reading this in 2011, is difficult because one knows how the story will end - Nicholas and Alexandra will be shot to death. Reading any biography of a dead person we always know the ending, but because the ending for these two is so brutal, one reads about their lives with a certain dread as the end for these two, and for the world they lived in, draws nearer and nearer. Still, Robert K Massie's writing is masterful and the book is a joy to read.Beginning the story with Alexandra's upbringing in Germany and with Nicholas' upbringing in Russia, he shows how they both lived, how they met, and how they fell in love. Unlike many other dynastic marriages, theirs was a love match. Upon ascending the throne, Alexandra did her duty to the empire by quickly producing four daughters and a son, the heir to throne (Sidenote: Catherine the Great's son so hated his mother that he made sure that from his reign on only a son could inherit the throne. This is why Catherine was the last female ruler of Russia and why none of Nicholas and Alexandra's four daughters were heir to the throne). Unfortunately, through her grandmother, Queen Victoria, Alexandra passed down hemophilia to her son, Alexis. Because the author's own son has hemophilia, he is very sensitive to the subject. And it is here where we find his thesis in the book - namely that the hemophilia of Alexis combined with the influence of Rasputin helped bring down Tsarist Russia. Because the Empress believed in the holy power of Rasputin to help heal her son, Alexandra relied on Rasputin. Much to the detriment of Russia. God had failed to provide a miracle cure for her son. So she turned to someone she felt could intercede on her behalf with her god.Unfortunately, the imperial family was surrounded in secrecy so no one would find out about the heir's hemophilia. This alienated the imperial family from the people. And when Nicholas was away at the front, Alexandra, with Rasputin at her side, governed Russia. Disastrously. Rasputin was murdered by Nicholas' own extended family who felt that Rasputin's influence needed to be curtailed. The Empress, a symbol of the Germans to the Russian people, was hated. Rasputin's murder came too late for Russia though. Due to the deteriorating conditions of the war, Petrograd in the winter of 1917 erupted in revolution. Nicholas was forced to abdicate. And knowing that he would be forced to leave the country, he chose to abdicate for his son too, who he worried would be left alone with people who would not understand his hemophilia.Nicholas and Alexandra, with their children, were imprisoned in a palace from March 1917. Unable to be exiled to England because of a hostile British government the family remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, Lenin returned from Switzerland and Trotsky returned from NYC to try to destroy the Menshevik government and institute a Bolshevik government (side note: Menshe in Russian means lesser and Bolshe in Russian means bigger. They lost and Lenin fled to Finland, waiting for his chance to return. Because from the start, there were more Bolsheviks than Mensheviks, Kerensky, a Menshevik, who was continuing the deeply unpopular war against Germany, was faced with the prospect of his government's fall. Fearing for the safety of the imperial family, Kerensky had them transferred to Tobolsk in Siberia. Meanwhile, Lenin and Trotsky, both Bolsheviks, promised to end the war. They got their chance. By November the Bolsheviks took power, and Kerensky was forced into exile. The Mensheviks had given way to the Bolsheviks. The war with Germany, the war that had helped to topple the Romanov dynasty, was ended. In Tobolsk, the exiled Imperial family, waited. Hoping for a rescue that would not come. The end is well known. The entire family was transported to Ekaterinburg, where they were all shot to death. Massie's description of that particular scene will probably end up seared in your mind for quite a while afterward.Though I knew what the end would be when I began the book, it still did not lessen the sadness I felt for a family's death. But reading about Nicholas and Alexandra's journey together and the world that they lived in was a great experience. Especially towards the end as one sees the many ways that the family could have been saved, one is left with a sense of anguish and frustration. But that same anguish and frustration is felt anytime one reads Russian history. So many possible routes that could have been taken. But it always seems to lead to too much autocracy and then to rebellion/revolution. Watching what is going on in Russia today just seems to reinforce this idea.Recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about pre-Revolutionary Russia and about the lives of the Romanov dynasty."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I first read Nicholas and Alexandra many years ago as a 14 year old. It was a transformative experience for me, awakening what has been a lifelong passionate interest in royal biography and Russian history. Now that I'm in my early fifties, I recently reread Nicholas and Alexandra for the first time in about twenty years, and it continues to have the same magic.Robert K. Massie became interested in the last Tsar of Russia because he, like Nicholas, was the father of a hemophiliac boy. Massie spent long hours reading about hemophilia and famous hemophiliacs, and he was fascinated by the way Russian and world twentieth century history turned on a chance genetic defect. Had Tsarevich Alexis not had hemophilia, it is probable that Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra would not have come under the malign influence of Gregory Rasputin, the Siberian faith healer who had a catastrophic effect on the Russian government before and during World War I; leading to the Russian Revolution, the rise of Communism, and the deaths of Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children. Its an interesting thesis that still holds up well, though Massie's focus on the inner tragedy of the Tsar's family tends to make him discount the many other problems from which pre-revolutionary Russia suffered. Massie also has a natural tendency to whitewash Nicholas and Alexandra (parents of hemophiliacs have a special bond with those who share their trauma, after all), by barely mentioning such negative traits as the Tsar's anti-Semitism and the Empress' many neuroses.The book remains an extraordinary work of art. Massie's descriptions of the Russian landscape and his finely drawn character sketches are wonderfully rich and detailed. He is able to explain the political and social complexities of the era colorfully and wittily, even when dealing with such abstractions as the differences between Social Democrats, Social Revolutionaries, and Bolsheviks. Most of all, Massie is able to make us weep for the Romanovs: a man who was a bad Tsar but a good husband and father, a woman who destroyed her family while trying to keep her son alive, and five innocent young people who never had a chance to lead happy, productive lives. Every time I read Nicholas and Alexandra I tremble again at the thought of their last awful moments, but I am enriched still more by the chance to read such a magnificent work of art and scholarship."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie has written a masterpiece.Graceful, informative ,never boring.One of the best introductions into the insanityof the Red Revolution and the rise of communism."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"That this book, over 35 years old, continues to be read is a tribute to its writer. The book is still read for a reason - its excellence. It had been on my \\"to read list\\" for years, and a long trip with several layovers finally prompted me to do it. It was stunning and long flights the layovers passed quickly.Despite the lack of access to materials, people and places inside the then USSR, Massie unearths significant original sources. His tremendous writing skills weave all this detail into the narrative... and what a sweeping narrative it is!Massie shows how the personalities of the Emperor and Empress and how their only son's fate as a hemophilic set the stage for not only their personal tragedy, but the tragedy of the Russian nation. Massie writes in a way that makes you care.This book was an enormous undertaking, and a labor of love. Massie says in the introduction that his also having a hemophilic son spurred this interest in the Tzar and Tzarina, caring for and protecting their son as best they knew how. Unfortunately for them, their protectiveness of the heir and the autocracy they felt he should have, blinded them.It was Alexander II's theory that for the monarchy to be preserved, it had to share it's power. Unfortunately his son, Alexander III, who succeeded him, felt that his father's reforms led to his ultimate assassination. Alexander III's death left his son with an extreme autocratic model of government which Nicholas II felt he had to preserve for his own son. Massie demonstrates how the personality of Nicholas, and its synergy with the reserve and monarchial dedication of Alexandra prevented any consideration of change and resulted in the ultimate end of the monarchy."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"First reccomended to me by a Professor of mine, Massie's work reveals all the intimate details and crucial historical story lines that even a novice of the Russian Revolutionary history would grasp to understand the life of the last Imperial Highnesses. From the infamous Bloody Sunday to the love letters that were exchanged between Nicholas and Alexandra the book was clearly exhaustively researched and also gives a touch of real emotion which is magnafied by the authors own personal experiences with the terrible disease of hemophelia. Grandoise as this story is it might well have been fiction, tragically it is not! As sad as the historical truths presented in the pages are, Massie writes words that flow and are easy to understand. I would reccomend this book for anyone looking for a story so incredible and emotionally raw that it had to be true or to anyone who wants to make some sense out of the mysticism of this part of intriging Russian history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I first read this book many years ago. Since that time, it has always been a favorite of mine. Massie does an excellent job of portraying the vast sweep of Russian and world events, and against it, the very intimate and human world of the Tsar and Tsarina; Nicholas and Alexandra come across as kind, decent people who simply are incapable of coping with the events they are handed. In particular, Massie does an excellent job of showing how the hemophilia of Alexis, added on top of everything else, was the straw that broke the camel's back. This book is wonderfully written and evocative, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone as a starting point to learn about the last Russian tsar."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book is an absolute must for anyone who wants to learn more about the last days of the Romanovs. Massie has outdone himself. The book is non-fiction, but has all the makings of a great historical novel--political intrigue, war, family life, not to mention a good love story. As a Romanov buff who has read many books on the family, this is the best by far."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"this a wonderfull book! the best on the romanovs! If you are interested in them just recently or for a long period of time this is the book for you! tells all about their lives and how they lived, how they traveled, where they lived, etc.! Robert K. Massie write wonderfull books!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This book is not just an excellent biography of Tsar Nicholas but provides both a valuable historical insight into past events which provide understanding of recent events this past decade. Bosnia/Sarajevo almost became a recent flashpoint for a war with Russia; the book reveals Austria-Hungary with German backing annexed Bosnia in 1908 with Germany forcing the Tsar/Serbia to recognize this annexation. Also, Imperial Germany had second thoughts on backing Lenin/Trotsky and tried to bring the Tsar back to Moscow to ratify the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, and essentially make him a puppet regime of Berlin. Massie reveals this intrigue and how it failed leaving a reader as myself with the conclusion Germany created a Frankenstein in smuggling Lenin into Russia to pursue its war aims.On another level Massie brings home to the reader how much personal family matters intrude into important matters of statecraft, appointments to high office, and military matters. This is a book which Russian officials today should read if they hope to bring sanity back to their dying country whose death-rate far exceeds its birth-rate. In our inter-dependent world those who despair of the future can do serious harm to others as well as to themselves. And all peoples can learn from the travails and circumstances of others.No doubt that Robert K Massie has made an important contribution to our understanding of the past which heavily influences contemporary society today. As I write this the United Nations Security Council stands challenged by U.S. President George W. Bush to inspect and disarm Iraq of all weapons of mass destruction. The world stands at a moment of decision and even faces the possibility of nuclear war should military action against Baghdad trigger a response and counter-response leading to regional destabilization and a firestorm. Russia particularly must anguish through a difficult decision process and has suffered under a closed-thought political system where information readily available to Westerners, as in this book, has not entered into the Russian market-place of ideas.I thus feel compelled to urge others to get this book into Russian officialdom by every creative measure."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert K. Massie's historical biography, &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, is one of the most enthralling, well-written books I have ever come across. As an amateur Russian scholar, I was immediately and completely absorbed in this fascinating and tragic story of Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, and his close-knit family. Massie has written two other fine histories on the Romanovs, &quot;Peter the Great&quot; and &quot;The Romanovs: The Final Chapter&quot;, but &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; remains his masterpiece. Highly recommended to anyone interested in history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I have loved N&amp;A for 5 years now.

And finally there is the great romance of Nicholas and Alexandra - as great a love story as any in history.Mr Massie has done a great job in painting this world of long ago, and it is written in a style that is both readable and very enjoyable.

Romantic and apologetic. But a pleasant and informative read."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is the best Romanov book ever! Its full of information.

Robert K. Massie is a very gifted writer. Although this is non-fiction, the author has an incredible way with words that transports you into the world of Imperial Russia and makes you feel like you're a silent observer of all the events unfolding. Massie provided background information on almost every character and even in further chapters would put a quick description of someone that was already mentioned so that helped me keep track of the names of the numerous ministers and generals. While I was reading, I couldn't help but become angry at Alexandra's obsession and naivety with Rasputin. Ministers would warn Nicholas and Alexandra of Rasputin's antics and Alexandra would treat these stories as lies and find ways to get the ministers dismissed. Nicholas on the other hand came across as likable and very kind, but meek and unassertive. I wondered if Nicholas had put his foot down and told Alexandra to stay out of politics or if Alix never married Nicky would this have never happened? Although the ending is no surprise, it was still heart-breaking to read how everything happened in Ekaterinburg. Great read for anyone interested in Russian or Royal history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"A REALLY WELL WRITTEN HISTORY LESSON. i'M NOT NECESSARILY A HISTORY BUFF, BUT THIS REALLLY HELD MY ATTENTION AND I GOT A HISTORY LESSON, TOO."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"One can not stop reading it.

Before reading any other book on the Romanovs definatly start with this one."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Wonderful, enthralling account of the last days of tsarist Russia. Robert Massie shows how the parental anguish over their son and heir's hemophilia, hidden away from public knowledge, helped bring down an empire as Alexandra turned to the mad monk Rasputin first to save the czarevitch's life and then to save Russia. Interwoven are absorbing descriptions of the social, cultural and political life of the country as well as finely drawn character descriptions of the Russian royal family and their relationships with each other. This comes across as a totally human, heartbreaking story with an inevitable end. You don't have to be Russian or royal to identify with the characters, but you will learn a lot of history painlessly while rapidly turning pages."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Journalist Robert K. Massie wrote this book partly to satisfy his curiosity about how the parents of the world's most famous hemophiliac dealt with their son's illness, and as the father of a hemophiliac himself, it's no coincidence. A father's need to satisfy his curiosity about how others dealt with similar misfortune has resulted in a work that is every bit as enriching as owning a Faberge egg--perhaps even more so. One walks away from reading this text with a pretty balanced view of both the Romanovs and the reformers of society. One learns not to be surprised that most Bolsheviks were of Jewish origin given the way the Jews were treated by the Czars for centuries, as well as the way the Czars's money was spent in the years before World War I. One feels sympathy for the unspoiled, intelligent Czarevenas whose potential for helping Russia never came to full fruition, and for the fate of a society destroyed by traditional rules and a genetic snafu that had thunderclap repercussions for generations afterwards."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I was thirteen when I first travelled to Russia.

I read it in two days, and due to it, I began I life-long passion for the Romanovs."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Massie tells a captivating story of the overturn of Tsarism and the change to communism.

Still an absolute must read for anybody interested in the end of Tsarist Russia, and a good read for just about anybody."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"This is an amazing book on the Imperial Family!

Massie, I will admit that his book holds a particular amount of merit for any Romanov enthusiast. Mr. Massie is an expert at crafting a historical piece of literature, into a pleasing story for anyone, and he does so here with startling effect. While I may disagree with Mr. Massie's sympathetic views I give Nicholas and Alexandra a \\"thumbs up\\" for the fantastic prose, and enduring image of the royal couple."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I first read this book many years ago. Mr. Massie manages to bring Nicholas, Alexandra, their family, and court back to life. The book reads almost like a novel at times and is very hard to put down.

The author is able to help the reader understand the series of events that lead to the fall of the monarchy and the murder of the royal family."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"The Author, Robert Massie, happened upon the writing of this book through his research to find out how others dealt with hemophilia. His son suffers from the disease as did the son of the last tsar of Russia. Wow...I happened upon this book by first seeing the english production of the film nicholas and alexandra. The movie was excellent but the book exceeds that of course. Read this book and obtain an understanding that people even in power are to be pitied. These poor souls were first the victims of their sons disease, Rasputin, the mystic but resourceful priest and the changes that Russia inevitably was to go through. This history of a country and a ruler, his wife and his family has often times made me wonder about their horrowful fate. These people did not deserve what they received in the end and I hope you draw this same conclusion after you read this novel. As the trailer notes state...&quot;A larger than life drama, so bizarre, so heartrending, and above all, so apocalyptic that no novelist would have dared invent it&quot;... Read it, you'll agree."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Robert Massie's book is spellbinding. I've reread it a dozen times, and each time I haven't been able to put it down. He paints such a vivid picture of the Imperial family, the Russian people, Rasputin, and the terror and uncertainty of the Revolution and its aftermath that I find it difficult to believe he wasn't there.I'm especially taken by his description of the relationship between Nicholas and Alexandra. He loved her, respected her, and valued her advice; but he may have been wrong to do so. It may have been his fatal mistake. Superstitious, distrustful and pathologically shy, Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt was not cut out to be the consort of an autocrat. When disaster struck, as it did when Alexei's hemophilia was diagnosed, she made poor decisions and refused to listen to wiser counsel. She may not have been the sole or even the main trigger of the Revolution, but a stronger wife would have made Nicholas a stronger czar, able to fight the Bolsheviks and win. Alexandra merely gave the enemies of the Czar another reason for revolution.My only concern with this book is that Massie was born too early (or wrote the book too soon). We've learned a great deal in the past few years about the fate of the Romanovs and their last days at Yekaterinburg. Massie of course couldn't have known that the official story of the Imperial Family's death was a lie; a reasonable reader wouldn't expect him to. However, those who use _Nicholas and Alexandra_ as a historical text would profit from further reading."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"The story of the last of the Romanovs is one that still keeps audiences interested, whether the focus is the revolution or the Mad Monk. This is the last gasp of old style royalty that the 20th Century was to experience and despite Massie's tendency to somewhat romanticize his subjects, the domestic tribulations of Nicholas and Alexandra make an interesting and illustrative foil for the civil strife that was going on outside the palace. It is fascinating to read some of the anecdotes recounted in this book that show the Tsar and his family to be, in many ways, an ordinary family, yet at the same time probably the wealththiest family in the world at the time. The dispair and extreme poverty of Russian peasantry is very lightly treated here, but then, this is the Romanov's story and like royalty everywhere and at all times, they were isolated from direct confrontation with unpleasant sights and sounds.Whatever else, this is a great story - of love, family tragedy, political blundering, inepept military decisions, court intrigue, conspicuous consumption, religious meddling, hypocracy, self deception, and hope - all part of the opening act of the new century. The old world of Tsarist glitter passes and the new world of Bolshevik drabness begins - and Nicholas and Alexandra are, with their family, caught in the middle."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I love it when non-fiction books explores the \\"personal\\" aspects of historical events.I minored in Russian History in college and recieved this book as a gift and love love loved it!The life and eventual downfall of the last Tsar and his family was endearing in the details-- not necessarily the overall history. A great example would be the fact that on the eve of the Russian Revolution three of the five royal children came down with the measles; of course she was a little preoccupied!Massie is an expert at blending primary historical texts (a lot of it is from the diary of the children's Swiss tutor Gillard) and his own words which makes the narrive flow much more gently than your average non-fiction historical book.What I think is the most interesting thing Massie points out, at great length, is that Nicholas II and Alexandra were two people who did not possess any more or less basic human flaws than the average person, but the introduction of Hemophilia into their family completely (and understandably) threw their private and public lives into a complete kilter.If you are not a fan of history or even Russian history I would still recommend this book, wonderfully written and researched about one of the most important events in the twentieth century!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"My wife dragged me to an exhibit at the Santa Fe Art Museum of items belonging to Nicholas and Alexandra. I knew nothing about the two, and saw little in the exhibit that further piqued my interest. But, on the way out, I did pick up a book on Rasputin as a souvenir. I started to read the Rasputin book, but then realized I could not appreciate Rasputin without first knowing the greater story of Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra. After researching what would be the best book to read, I got R. Massie?s Nicholas and Alexandra.My oh my, what a fascinating read that has turned out to be. The high stars given by most other reviewers on this site are well deserved and on the money. Massie creates a captivating story in the process of describing a critical time in 20th Century history. I read it with the relish and enthusiasm of a richly embroidered page-turner. I normally do not read a lot of history. But if all history was written as well as this, I?d probably read so much of it that I?d scarcely have time to read anything else. I can?t wait to find other works that are as rich, informative, and entertaining as Massey?s Nicholas and Alexandra."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"...this should be that book! Since my tenth-grade world history teacher lent me his copy back in 1990, I've become a bit of a fanatic. ;o) It's a great overview of the lives of Tsar Nicolas II and his family, and why the political tide in Russia turned against them. And while the account's purview is broad, it includes numerous, delightful little details about the people involved - Massie event mentions the young grand duchess' favorite perfumes!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"My Soviet upbringing and education have never provided any in-depth analysis of the last Emperial family, thus reading this book was very educational. I wish I knew these facts when I was still in the USSR. For the first time I have clearly realized the complexity and charm of my motherland, thanks to the author. There is a feeling of love and affection to Russia and its people throughout the book.I only disagree with the main underlying theme of the book that Alexis' desease brought Russia to its collapse - this would be naive to believe - however I understand the author's personal bias.Solid read and thorough analysis on the author's part. Thank you for a good historical overview!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"In print and widely available for nearly half-a-century now, few works of non-fiction have proven as enduring and captivating as Robert Massie's historical love story about the demise of the Romanov dynasty.Massie is one of the most gifted popular historians of our age. He is one of a handful of authors who can write 500+ page history books on relatively obscure topics -- Peter the Great, the British/German naval race of 1890-1914, etc. -- that one would readily recommend to everyday neighbors or co-workers.Massie wrote this book for a very special reason -- he is the father of a hemophiliac son. It is no wonder that Massie's descriptions of Tsarevich Alexis' excruciating episodes of daylong bleeds into his joints are so vividly conveyed and heart wrenching. Indeed, in many ways Massie \\"was there\\" and knows from personal experience the mental, emotional and physical anguish of hearing a beloved child cry out in pain to his utterly helpless parents.The story that Massie tells is simple and straightforward - likely too simple and straightforward for serious students of the Russian Revolution. He argues that it was Alexis' hemophilia that led Tsarina Alexandra to embrace Rasputin as a true man of God and the only one capable of saving her son and thus saving the Romanov dynasty in Russia. His ability to ease Alexis' pain and bleeding - even today defying thoroughly convincing medical explanations - blinded Alexendra to reports of Rasputin's debauchery and the harm her relationship to him was doing to the image of the Imperial family and government. And it was Rasputin - who Massie grandiosely calls \\"one of the most extraordinary and enigmatic men to appear on earth\\" - that opened the door to Lenin and the collapse of autocracy in Russia. The Tsarina and the Siberian Man of God thus dominate Massie's story.German by birth and a reluctant Lutheran convert to Orthodoxy, Alexandra ultimately embraced both her adopted country and religion with the passion and fervor of the convert. She dominated her marriage with the amiable and hardly autocratic autocrat Tsar Nicholas II, who was married to Alexandra and suddenly thrust upon the Russian thrown in 1894 at the tender age of 26. Massie describes the Tsarina as an extremely able and willful woman who was never fully accepted nor even liked by the Russian people or the Russian court.Massie describes a few events as critical to the fall of the House of Romanov. First, obviously, was the birth of the Romanov's fifth child and only boy, Alexis, and learning that he suffered from hemophilia, a fact that the family kept a closely guarded secret his whole life. Second, Rasputin made a dramatic and seemingly miraculous appearance at Alexis' bedside after a nasty fall and internal bleed in Spala in 1912, which Massie says convinced Alexandra that the monk was a legitimate Man of God endowed with supernatural powers (acts followed up by similar performances with Alexis in 1915 and with court confidant Anna Vyrobova after a train accident in 1916). Third, Massie puts great emphasis on the Tsar's 1915 decision to relieve his uncle Grand Duke Nicholas as commander in chief of the army and to take personal command of the army at the front while leaving Alexandra to manage affairs in Petrograd in his absence. For the first time, Alexandra took a genuine leadership role in affairs of state and relied extensively - Massie almost argues exclusively - on the opinions and recommendations of Rasputin in picking cabinet members. Massie claims that Rasputin's influence reached its meridian with the appointment of Sturmer as prime minister and minister of foreign affairs and Protopopov as minister of the interior, positions they owed exclusively to being favorably disposed to Rasputin. Henceforth, the fractious Duma was united in just one cause - opposition to the Imperial government.Massie describes Alexandra as thoroughly hated by the Russian population by 1916. She was thought to be a spy because of her German heritage and most were convinced that her relationship with Rasputin was sexual in nature. Massie also insists that Rasputin had no interest in power himself. He was more mystic consigliere to the Empress than eminese grise of the Imperial government, he argues. Massie writes that Rasputin wanted nothing more than to be left alone to indulge in his concupiscent lifestyle in an uninhibited manner - a lifestyle that was the talk of Petrograd by the time he was murdered in late 1916 (technically poisoned, shot, beaten and drowned) by Prince Youssopov, a member of the royal family and the wealthiest heir in all of Russia. Indeed, this story has more twists and turns that most novels.If you are not the type to usually go for history books, give this one a try. You almost certainly will not be disappointed and will see that history - well written and enjoyably told - is every bit as enjoyable as non-fiction."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"...that this, in fact, a meticulously researched book. I had the privilege of reading this book many times; while it is definitely a scholarly classic, it is so delightful and unbelievably easy to read that; a person of any educational background,, would be able to comprehend this book The style of writing is descriptive yet precise; and provides an accurate and poignant account of the lives of NIcholas and his family. The words flow so smoothly thougout the book that one forgets that it is, indeed, entirely factual; it reads like a novel. It is so enjoyable to read that, both my daughters read this book when they were 9; they both loved it. (I have to laugh, recalling how my younger daughter thought the word &quot;dowager&quot; was &quot;dogwagger&quot; and asked me what on earth that word meant.) Two years later, in this same daugher'sr history class, the last Romanov family was mentioned by the teacher. My daughter was able to provide so much accurate information that her teacher asked her if she cared to teach the remainder of the class. She also utilized the information in this book to refute information being taught by her Russian history professor during her first year at college.PLEASE...read this book. Mr. Massie will grab your heart with his prose and pulll you through a gamut of emotions, the final one guaranteed to be a genuine affection for NIcholas II and his beautiful family."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I first read this when I was 14, I loved it then and 30 years later I still love it. I finally got the hard back version after christmas. Robert Massie really brings Nicholas and Alexandra and thier world to life. He tells their tragic story in a very human way and helps the reader to understand some of the decisions made by the Imperial couple. He tells of the relationship between Alexandra and Rasputin. Rasputin's influence over the Alexandra and in turn her influence over Nicholas. He tells the story of the five children of Nicholas and Alexandra, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and their son heir to the Romanov throne Alexis. I would recommend this book to all lovers of history."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"As a 42-two-year-old, I had learned about this tragedy while in school. I had always been fascinated with their story, but knew little of the actual story leading up to the events. I decided to read this book on my kindle and will never feel the same about the events of that day. I was mesmerized from the very beginning. Even though I knew from history what the outcome was, I became very involved with this story. This book brought their world alive to me, and even though we all know the ending, I found myself wishing throughout that I could change the facts, that they would somehow make it out alive. Of course they didn't, and of course I cried at the moment of the execution. I felt so much for this family of almost a hundred years ago, because this arthur brought them to life for me. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I just love this author. I knew nothing about Russian History and have never been drawn to reading history. This was a page turner. It has led me to read Peter the Great and I am sure I will get to Catherine the Great as well. The skill of Robert Massie draws the reader in so that history comes alive. It is far from dry, which was my fear. I am now so interested in Russian History that my husband and I are planning a trip there this summer. Thank you Robert K. Massie."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I knew extremely little about the Romanov's before beginning to read this book. A passing mention in another book I was reading made me want to know more, and this is the book I chose. I was a little apprehensive when I first got it. Its a good sized book, and I wondered if it would be able to hold my attention.I could not put it down!This book brings these people from a far-off land and a far-off time into your heart. It has made me feel as if I almost knew them.The violence and injustice done to them is hard to read or think about.I have a feeling this one is going to stay with me for a long, long time."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"After discovering that Robert Massie has a biography of Catherine the Great coming out, I dug out my old copy of Nicholas and Alexander figuring I'd skip around in it until the new book became available. It didn't take much skipping before I settled down and read the book cover to cover for the third time.Nicholas and Alexander is a magnificent biography, monumental in scope and intimate in detail. It tells the story of Russia's last tsar and his family as they are swept up in the tide of history during the early 20th century. From the battlefields to the peasant uprisings to the opulent ballrooms and finally to the Bolshevik revolution that forced the Romanov's from power, Massie is able to make readers understand the historic sweep of the period. Beyond that, he is also able to give the reader a warm and personal account of the Romanovs: Nicholas, the morally strong but politically weak tsar; Catherine, his German wife who he loved but the Russia people distrusted; his four daughters and Alexis, the only son and heir to the throne who suffered from hemophilia. Massie tracks the family's history from the height of power to the depth of despair as they wait as prisoners for their eventual execution at the hands of a fledgling government that didn't know what to do with them.The book also focuses on the mystic monk Rasputin who was able to treat Alexis' painful condition and who parlayed this talent into growing influence over the family. Lenin and other early communist leaders are also profiled, though these parts of the book always seemed the least interesting to me because the ever-shifting cast of leaders seems hard to follow. No sooner does one leader take over than he's ousted and another takes his place.Overall, Nicholaw and Alexander is a superb achievement. It ranks among the very top of a list of great biographies ... a work that is as epic in its depiction of history as it is intimate in what is at its very heart a love story."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"After reading this book I became a history addict. Never having read any non-fiction before it drew me in like the greatest novels and I seek out great non-fiction regularly now. If you want to read a great love story, a tragic novel, or a meticulously researched book about the Romanov family this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"I absolutely love this book. Robert Massie presents Nicholas and Alexandra in the most human terms, more loving parents and partners than tsar and tsarina. The writing is superb, and transports the reader to this tumultuous time and space. History may not have treated Nicholas and Alexandra very kindly, but you can't help but empathize with their plight after reading Massie's incredible portrait of their lives. I am so touched at the intimacy of their family relationshiops, and they seem like lovely people, but maybe a little dense. Perhaps they were just not qualified or prepared to rule over the largest empire in the world. I picked this book up at a flea market years ago, and it's been sitting on a shelf unread because I thought it might be too academic or boring. I couldn't have been more wrong. My copy is from the late 1960s, and this book is still in print, if that speaks to the quality of the biography. I have just ordered The Romanovs - the Final Chapter by the same author, as I'm obsessed and want to know more about the last royal family of Russia. I also have Peter the Great, for which Massie was given the Pulitzer prize, on my To Read list. This is honestly one of the best books I have read in years. It has earned a place in my permanent collection."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Although this is not an historical novel, it almost reads like one. It is an in-depth (character analysis?) of the Romanovs, taking the reader step by step to the events that led to the downfall of the Romanovs. As you're reading, you can almost hear yourself say to the Romanovs, \\"Don't do that! It will lead to your destruction!\\" But of course you can't and the rest is history. A well written book, logically flowing to tell you the who's, what's and why's of the Romanovs. Anyone who is a Russian hisotry fan will love this book."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Far and away one of the best biographies I have ever read. Massie masterfully gives life to the doomed, tragic last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, and his family. I was absolutely rivetted from page one by this outstanding work. The book gives a sympathetic portrait of Tsar Nicholas, his wife Empress Alexandra, and their ongoing struggle to cope with their haemophiliac son, Alexei, heir to the Russian throne. Alexei's illness indirectly leads to the downfall of the Romanov dynasty and the family's murder. An astonishingly good read, and one I highly recommend to all who are interested in this era of history."},{"Title":"Lo!","review":"Charles Fort is considered the venerable grandfather of anomalistic literature, and with good reason - his works are a fantastical Sears-Roebuck of frogs falling from the sky, rocks thrown by invisible hands, spontaneous human combustion, and people who disappear and reappear at random. If you're going to be in the field at all, you should read your Fort.Of course, that's not to say that he's perfect. Fort's tongue-in-cheek message about science and the nature of reality is easy to misunderstand, and he doesn't do anything to help the situation with a dense, run-on prone style of prose. For the researcher, his occasional lack of documentation is also frustrating.All in all, though, this is definitely a book worth checking out if you can find it."},{"Title":"Lo!","review":"Being an avid reader of John Keel,Ivan Sanderson,Colin Wilson,etc.for the last 30 years I only recently began reading Mr.Fort himself.My first book that I read by him &quot;the book of the damned&quot; was interesting but quite disappointing when compared to people like Keel and such.However,&quot;Lo!&quot; on the other hand is just what I was looking for.A vast collection of Forteana.Weird rains,vampire attacks,ghosts,sea monsters and other creatures,disappearances,ufos-whatever you want,it's in there.This is a book that should keep you focused for hours on end as it is great reading."},{"Title":"Lo!","review":"It seems that many people's complaints about this book is that Mr. Fort never explains his exact view. However, this is what is so wonderful; he doesn't crowd out your own thoughts with his own dogmatic beliefs. He leaves room for you to draw your own conclusions. I'm 12 and I understand this book perfectly. Maybe it is that you need to open your mind to accept the unexplained, to have imagination. \\"We will pick up an existence by its frogs.\\""},{"Title":"Lo!","review":"Well I ran into another Ace classic pulp edition of LO! and found it not only worth a third read (that in itself says it all) but a book profoundly liberating.LO! takes on Einstein by detailing peer-reviewed, academic, empirical studies which contradicted Einstein's theory. Back when Fort wrote LO! such \\"walking the plank\\" manuevers by any writer would be considered unfortunate at best. Today though, with the upsurge of Modified Newtonian Dyanamics (MOND) to account for the missing 96% of the universe (of whatever) Charles Fort has finally come into his own.The man was a genius because he runs the gamut of possible explanations for his \\"damned facts\\" but does so in a writing style that competes with Beckett or Joyce.Those damned teleporting whirlwinds! With quantum electronics repeatedly verifying faster-than-light signals (not just \\"after the fact\\" randomized superliminal information that was correlated) Fort's teleporting whirlwinds are now in the lab!If anything, for those who find Fort's conjectures hard to digest, he at least recreates the grand wonder of discovery, showing how essentially humans are puny little nodes in a vast network of self-organizing complexity. But then that's what the top science research states as well, although most of the \\"real\\" scientists are psychologically not able to handle the new power laws of network theory.That's why LO! should be required reading for all \\"serious\\" scientists.Why limit ourselves?"},{"Title":"Lo!","review":"Way up on that old misty mountainWhere the bear and the catamount range,A pale ghostly lightCan be seen every nightThat no scientist or hunter can explain.-- \\"The Brown Mountain Light\\"_Lo!_ (1931) is the third of Charles Fort's four stranger-than-science books and the last to be published during his lifetime. His final book, _Wild Talents_ (1932), was published a few months after his death. The title for the book was suggested by Fort's friend Tiffany Thayer. It was meant to be a satirical reference to astronomers who were constantly predicting that a heavenly body would appear in the sky when nothing would in fact be there. It was a joke that backfired. A bit later, Pluto was discovered where Percival Lowell calculated that it would be.Charles Fort (1874--1932) was a quiet, walrus-shaped man who delighted in creating strange games and collecting natural history artifacts. He was an Hegalian and a self-professed skeptic. But most of all, he was keenly interested in researching anomalies, strange phenomena, and odd occurances that he believed could not be readily explained by orthodox science. He hoped to accumulate a mass of \\"data\\" or \\"damned information\\" that would serve as an Hegelian antithesis to a scientific thesis.Fort waxes satirical about what he called the Scientific Priestcraft, but he is also satirical about himself and his sources of information: \\"Lies, yarns, hoaxes, mistakes-- what's the specific gravity of a lie, and how am I to segregate?\\" (chapter one). Elsewhere, Fort warns the reader that his works should be considered more fiction than fact. His tongue is always firmly in his cheek, and his humor is one of his most endearing traits as a writer. He is not trying to make us true believers in a single cause. He is encouraging us to think for ourselves.But if Fort cannot bring himself to segregate, modern readers must. Some of Fort's hypotheses that he offers in _Lo!_ are clearly preposterous: that the Earth is more flat than spherical and rotates only once a year; that it is surrounded by a crystal ceiling over our heads; that the stars are holes in this ceiling through which light shines; that there is a Sargasso Sea in the crystal sky from which drop rains of fish, frogs, periwinkles, and chunks of meat; that sheep and cattle are frequently slaughtered by werewolves and vampires; and that people, animals, and objects are routinely teleported about. (Fort invented the terms \\"teleportation\\" and \\"telekinesis\\".)I am highly skeptical of Fort's accounts of ghosts, poltergeists, bleeding statues, human spontaneous combustion, and feats of extrasensory perception. But they are at least a bit more plausible than items in the first category.Accounts that seem to me to be either probable or well documented include red rains and snow, meteor showers and thunderstones, wheels of Poseidon in the ocean, the Brown Mountain lights, lights or objects in the sky (_not_ flying saucers), odd sea creatures (_not_ sea serpents), animal mutations, deadly flash floods, and strange footprints and fossils.Fort discusses a number of classical mysteries: the _Marie Celeste_, the disappearance of Ambrose Bierce, Benjamin Bathurst (who \\"walked around the horses\\" and vanished), the Jersey devil, and Kaspar Hauser. Other items of interest include alleged scientific hoaxes, lesser known vanishings at sea, the case of Agatha Christie, cases of amnesia (or purported amnesia), and the Man from Mars. One case not discussed is the Loch Ness monster. While stories of this creature were told for quite some time, it did not receive widespread publicity until 1934, two years after Fort's death. I suspect that Fort would have loved to haved written about Nessie had he known of her. I will leave it to individual readers to decide whether they agree with Fort's interpretations of these events.Unfortunately, there are a number of Forteans today who take Fort literally and who completely miss his humor. Martin Gardner has written of these latter-day believers:If a Baker Street Irregular began to think that Sherlock Holmes actually did exist, all the good clean fun would vanish. Similarly, when a Fortean seriously believes that all scientific theories are equally absurd, all the rich humor of the Society gives way to an ignorant sneer. (_Fads and Fallacies_, 1957, 49)I am not generally a fan of proponents of pseudoscientific movements. But I do have a fondness for Fort, with this _caveat_: When you read _Lo!_, remember that Fort was more of a humorist and a writer of nonsense than he was a profound and solemn philosopher."},{"Title":"Lo!","review":"Fort was a very interesting man and and his investigations are even more so.

W. H, Hudson assembled this history from the tales and remembrances of some of the aged residents, particularly an old man who had been a shepherd his entire life. There are many descriptions of the relationship between shepherds and their dogs,peculiar behaviors of various animals,tales of strange people, and extensive descriptions of the land itself. There are stories of the humble lives of the sheepherders and their many hardships. There is condemnation of the hoggish practices of the large landowners who lived in luxury and hoarded all the land and the rights thereof, yet denied the common people even a decent living. Shining through all this is the pride these simple workmen felt in their craft and expertise. The book had a slow start and seemed rather mundane at first, but gradually built up a mood which drew me in to this world. It is a very quaint change of pace to our modern existence. The quality of writing was excellent. I read this book because I enjoyed the author's natural history classic,The Naturalist in La Plata. I felt rewarded that I did."},{"Title":"A shepherd's life","review":"I love the pieces that are included in this edition; however, they are merely smatterings taken from A Shepherd's Life.

Seton is known for her well crafted works in that genre, and MY THEODOSIA may not disappoint her loyal readers. I myself came to Anya Seton's book not because of what she had to offer as a novelist, but because I was hoping to learn more about Theodosia Burr Alston and to spend a while in her company. I'm an Aaron Burr fan, and I wanted to read about the well educated, intelligent, heroic daughter who stood at his side through the good times and the bad.Instead, Anya Seton's Theodosia is a weak female, easily manipulated and very conventional. Not only does she not take an interest in politics, she seems downright closed minded and at times bigoted. Her complaints about the South, about her husband's family, and about the slaves who surround her make one almost sympathize with her beleaguered, incompetent husband. There are racist overtones to the writing, not only in the way African facial features are described, but even when the term \\"swarthy\\" is used to characterize poor Joseph Alston's unattractiveness. (This is really odd, because Theodosia herself has always been depicted as rather dark.)Aaron Burr comes off as a schemer intent on nothing but his own advancement, and Theodosia is the mere victim of her father's unscrupulousness. This may reflect the accepted, textbook version that has been passed down to us, but if you want a more interesting, nuanced portrait of both the man and his daughter, I recommendBurr: A Novel."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Having read this well-written book many years ago and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I decided it was time to pay an old friend another visit and re-read it.

There are indications here that she will eventually by a wonderful writer, but I would not qualify this as a wonderful book. It drags, it meanders, and occasionally it restates itself. The reader feels sympathy for the main character at first, but after about 100 pages of \\"pity poor Theodosia,\\" it gets a little old. In the end, instead of sympathy, I felt only a kind of disgusted pity for a very pathetic character. This is really too bad, because in the beginning Seton creates a very strong, interesting character, then begins to whittle away her good qualities. I especially liked the parts about Alexander Hamilton and his conflicts with Aaron Burr. Historically, this is a very interesting novel. Romantically, not so much. There are streaks of a compelling story, but if you want a really good Seton book, read Katherine or Avalon or Devil Water."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"This was a gift for a friend and she loved the story and also the history. She is lending it to everyone she knows."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Actually, Theodosia haunts a stretch of beach between Cape Hatteras and Nags Head, North Carolina, on the beautiful Outer Banks. I've never seen her, but you can if you walk up the beach at Cape Hatteras toward Nags Head on an overcast day between Christmas and New Year. Just look for the childlike woman dressed in old fashioned clothes. If you see her, tell her she can stop looking for her portrait, because it was found and taken to New York many, many years ago. I believe it, don't you? If you have read Charles Harry Whedbee's &quot;Legends of the Outer Banks and Tarheel Tidewater&quot;, it claims that pirates killed everyone on her ship but her. Other accounts say that the pirates killed everyone, stole all the valuables on ship, and somehow the portrait got to New York."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"This book tells the story of Aaron Burr and his daughter Theodosia (Theo). I have to admit I didn't recall much of Burr from history class outside of the duel with Alexander Hamilton. At the start of the book Theo is 17 and Burr is vice president of the United States. Burr plots to have Theo married to the wealthy but uninteresting Joseph Alston of South Carolina. Burr needs some of that money to cover his debts and also the power of the Alstons to gain him political support in the south. The relationship between Burr and Theo is closer than most father/daughter relationships and Burr is able to manipulate Theo into his increasingly risky and treasonous schemes that distance her ever further from any satisfying relationship she might forge with her husband, and her greatest joy in life is her young son.There are lots of well known names in the story as Theo interacts with them -- Washington Irving (a minor character), Meriwether Lewis (sigh!), Dolly Madison, Alexander Hamilton and more. I love the way she sets her scenes and writes the various dialects, it's like you really hear them as they would be spoken. Her characters could have been fleshed out better, there is so much subject material in the Burr story and it's twists and turns that could be turned into a gloriously fat and meaty work of historical fiction. Writers out there -- HINT HINT HINT.Be advised that if you read up on Aaron and Theo on the internet prior to finishing the book you will end up with some spoilers on your hands. However, do look Theo up afterwards and the legends surrounding her mysterious disappearance and the strange ghost that haunts a Carolina shore. Lastly, I was very glad there was not another forward by Philppa Gregory. The one she wrote for Devil Water and the way she obsessed about the too close relationship between father and daughter really irked me to no end."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"I read this in high school, this tragic tale of the ill-fated daughter of former vice- president Aaron Burr, and wife of Govenor Joseph Alston, Theodosia Burr Alston, who is said to haunt a beach in South Carolina. In 1812 Theodosia was on a ship that went down off the coast of North Carolina. The bodies of all the others lost at sea washed up, but hers was never found.It never ceases to amaze me how well Anya Seton can take historical facts, and blend with them just enough drama to make them readable, but not innacurate.You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Theodosia Burr is the smart, adoring, seventeen-year-old daughter of Aaron Burr, who was vice-president at a time when one attained the office by being the runner-up in a presidential election. Thus, the president, Thomas Jefferson, is actually his political rival. Having run into both political and financial hardship, Aaron arranges for Theodosia to marry Joseph Alston, a wealthy but unattractive and dull Carolina planter. Shocked that her father would be desperate enough to send her to such a fate, but resigned, Theodosia goes willingly and begins her life at The Oaks, Joseph's plantation. A son brings her boy joy and pain, as does a clandestine relationship with Meriwether Lewis who, along with William Clark, is about to embark on his famous exploration into the unknown western territory.Theodosia's ultimate fate is suggested at the end of the book, although the reality is that it is still a mystery. This book appears to be out of print, which is unfortunate as Anya Seton is very talented and has become one of my favorite authors of historical fiction. I didn't enjoy this work quite as well as some of her others, but it's definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Having read this well-written book many years ago and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I decided it was time to pay an old friend another visit and re-read it.

I learned a lot about Aaron Burr and the lifestyles of different regions in the early days of our nation. Theodosia's story is a sad one. By the end of the book I felt like I knew her and cared for her."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Over the past few months I have been reading, or re-reading, all of Anya Seton's works, and I just finished re-reading My Theodosia, which I first read several years ago. One of the things I like about Anya Seton's historical \\"biographies\\" is that, rather than write about the popular figures who are already the subject of countless biographies, and whose stories we already know, she instead focuses on the lesser-known minor players of history. My Theodosia, Devil Water and The Winthrop Woman all tell the stories of people that history has largely forgotten. It is probably even likely that Katherine Swynford wasn't so well-known to the general public until Anya Seton wrote a book about her.In My Theodosia, Seton's first book, she points her pen at Theodosia Burr Alston. Although the book is about Theodosia, the real \\"main character\\" of this story is actually Theodosia's relationship with her father, the scheming, self-serving, but fascinating scoundrel Aaron Burr. Their father/daughter relationship was truly remarkable; while Burr was in many ways ahead of his time in his views of women, and in the way he raised and trained his daughter, at the same time he maintained a Svengali-like hold over her throughout all of her short life. She ultimately sacrificed everything -- even her chance at true love -- on the altar of devotion to her father.I think what will be most troublesome about this book to modern readers is the way Seton depicts slaves in the South (\\"protruding lips around enormous white teeth, slate-back skin, and rolling eyes\\") and her frequent use of the \\"n\\" word. I had to remind myself that she was 1) presenting blacks as they probably would have seemed to an upper-class young girl from the North in the days when slavery was still an ingrained institution in both North and South and blacks were widely considered less than human, and 2) this book was written in the 1940s, long before the days of civil rights or sensitivity to such issues.My Theodosia is a charming peek into upper-class American life in the very early 1800's, and the author weaves in vignettes of some of the early American greats (James and Dolly Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Washington Irving). Seton managed to paint a vivid picture of the time and place without fulsome or verbose descriptions, a style she maintained throughout all her books. Aaron Burr's escapades fill the book as they filled his daughter's life, and woven throughout is a bittersweet love story of Theodosia and the true love of her life. Although this is not Anya Seton's strongest work, it is highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the US, is a difficult figure to fathom. He was wanted for the \\"murder\\" of Alexander Hamilton and never tried for it. He was later was charged with treason and acquitted. History has not been kind to him. A recent work:Fallen Founder: The Life of Aaron Burrmakes a good case for his vindication as in some ways Gore Vidal does too in his 1973 fictional work:Burr: A Novel.This 1941 novel shows Burr and all his contradictions through his daughter, Theodosia. Her mother died when she was 11 and her single father did not pass her along to a female relative as was the custom, he raised her himself according to the progressive methods of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.As Seton tells it, Theodosia, like a European princess, acceded to her father's connivance of a marriage designed to a suit his economic and political needs. At 17 Theo accepted the hand of the heir of a prominent South Carolina plantation family. Theo's father, received the South Carolina's electoral votes (and possibly loans or cash) that almost made him president.Theodosia had been raised on literature, languages and a love of theater. This background is a bad fit for a rice growing family spread over several plantations, all of which seem to be in need of repair. She does not love this man; her heart belongs to Daddy and in this novel, another historical personage.In speculating on the life of Theodosia, the book shows the stiff courtship that once passed as romance, the contrast of northern and southern cultures, something of the personal dynamics of slave labor and the daring life of Aaron Burr. The racism is a little hard to swallow. The use of pejoratives can be justified in the dialog of these 19th century characters, but the author's voice reflects their view as well."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Love this book-couldnt put it down. Kept wondering how much was true and blown away by fact of her feeling for Merriwether Lewis. I felt as though I got to know Aaron Burr very intimately. Wonderful descriptions of both South Carolina countryside and Richmond Hill & Hudson. Although I adored her novel Katherine I have enjoyed the simplicity and length of this book more."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Kindle should really make an effort to edit the older books. Looks like the book is just scanned and every page contains errors, mostly \\"c\\" for,\\"e\\"s- very distracting. Seems to be an ongoing problem with older kindle books."},{"Title":"My Theodosia","review":"Really readable and enjoyable story of Theodosia, daughter of charismatic and ambitious Vice-President Aaron Burr. Levered into an unsatisfying marriage which will benefit her father, Theodosia is sent to the fever-filled lands of the Waccamaw Neck in S. Carolina, where her husband owns a plantation.Yet everything in her life takes second place to the father she adores:'you appear to me so superior, so elevated above all other men, I contemplate you with such a strange mixture of humility, admiration, reverence, love and pride, that very little superstition would be necessary to make me worship you as a superior being' (from an actual letter she wrote in 1809).However her father's star is on the wane- debt, killing a political rival in a dual, and his subsequent grandiose schemes to become- like his contemporary Napoleon- an emperor, lead to his being a wanted man...Seton conjures up the world of 1800s Carolina particularly well: the scenery, the 'gullah' slave communities, the plantations and the disease.Some of the romantic scenes were faintly Mills and Boonish, but I did enjoy the book and learnt so much!"},{"Title":"Wild and Woolly: A Journal Keeper's Handbook","review":"Alfred is a friend and colleague of mine. He gave me a copy of his book and I put it aside to read...later. It's a book about journal writing, something I've been a miserable failure at for most of my life. Out of a sense of duty to my friend and a deep curiosity given Alfred's great wisdom and vivacious personality, I brought the book with me on vacation. I took two books: Wild and Woolly: a Journal Keeper's Handbook and a mindless romance novel (my favorite way to spend a day at the beach.)I chose Alfred's book to read first because I figured it would be a quick read: Pick it up, get the gist of it so I could say that I read it and move on. Whoa! Was I pleasantly surprised that I was hooked before I finished the first page! I have several journal type books decorating my shelves all purchased with the hope that they would inspire me to journal. Alfred's book lit a spark in me that got me excited about writing like none other. I couldn't stop reading and then couldn't wait to get my journal so that I could start writing.The last entry in my journal was in early 2002. I woke the pages of my dusty journal with a response to one of the first exercises about overcoming obstacles. I love the way that Alfred divides the book into sections so that if I feel like writing, drawing, problem solving, or anything else, I can read the section that moves me and find words and exercises to help \\"unclog\\" my thinking and get me going. Once unleashed, I can fly.Mostly, I love that Alfred is REAL in his book. He writes in the first person and tells personal stories and realistic examples which while reading got me thinking, \\"If Alfred could write this, so can I...\\" It's also visually appealing, is presented in an \\"easy read\\" style and is straightforward and to the point. I read it and feel inspired rather than overwhelmed as I have with other books cast aside to use... later.Thank you, Alfred, for such a great Handbook. Your essence comes through and that's a wonderful thing. For all who might buy this book: If you are interested in getting un-stuck in your journal writing, check out this Wild and Woolly handbook!"},{"Title":"Wild and Woolly: A Journal Keeper's Handbook","review":"This book has an unfortunate title. I first imagined blank pages of paper with outrageous ways to record your thoughts or funky paper styles that connect to my wild and crazy inner being, with maybe some do's and don'ts on the side, like proper grammar, discipline strategies, when to write, how often, etc. I have never kept a journal or diary despite several friends encouraging me to do so. I would never even pick up this book because the title tells me it is an artsy \\"handbook\\" for a writer. I am not a writer and I don't want to keep a journal, wild or woolly! So why do I give this 5 stars? I loved this book, because there are not many books that I pick up that can successfully inspire me. There are many books on the subject of how to be successful in life. Just to be clear, the author does talk about writing, but this book could apply to any endeavor. There are 12 chapters with titles like: Overcoming Obstacles, Problem Solving, Lists, Maps and Wilderness, Honoring Our Teachers, Kinship and Community: What We Have in Common....... Hello! This book is full of stories of people working towards goals and how they overcome common difficulties. Has anybody read \\"7 Habits for Highly Effective People\\" or Scott Peck's \\"The Road Less Traveled\\"? This book is very similar in \\"product\\" but refreshingly different in \\"process\\". This is not a step by step how to HANDBOOK. There are some exercises in the book for all you left brain types, the author was essentially a teacher at the Maine College of Art in Portland, Maine. The finer points of how to be successful are in this book, and they are expressed through the author, other authors and the stories of everyday people, most notably his students from workshops and his 20 years as a teacher. But maybe these quotes, that he quotes, from the book, can capture the flavor of the book:\\"Because inside human beings is where God learns\\"and this.....\\"Sometimes I go about pitying myself, and all the time I am being carried on great winds across the sky\\".So when you are done reading the next \\"How to Achieve Your Goals/Dreams\\", and you have all your step by step lists and notes, read this book to actually make it happen for you, how to get it to agree with the humanity and inhumanity in the human. And if you are a writer, all the more reason to learn from someone who has been teaching this subject all his life. But it's really for anyone, like me.... after all, don't we all use words or language to survive, flourish and express all of hopes and dreams, our desire?"},{"Title":"Wild and Woolly: A Journal Keeper's Handbook","review":"As a high school English teacher, I found \\"Wild and Woolly\\" both edifying and inspiring.

It is a great, practical resource for teachers who write and who want kids to write more."},{"Title":"Wild and Woolly: A Journal Keeper's Handbook","review":"I am delighted to find, \\" Wild and Wooly\\" on Amazon. I have read and used this book many times over the past 6 yrs and find myself reinvigorated and excited about Journaling and being a creative leader each time I open it. It is packed with useful exercises that you can do in sequence or jump into the middle of - this is how I like to use it. It is difficult to choose a favorite chapter because each segment serves a different purposes in guiding or prodding me in my regular writing practice. Dialogues opens with a procrastinating technique used by many creatives that speaks to the universal and totally makes me laugh out loud. The List - chapter is so practical and everyday useful that anyone can bring it into practice and probably already does but had not considered as an integral part of journaling. The Maps and Drawing sections blow the whole thing wide open and makes me aware of the limitless potential of the Journal format. I often write lists, draw maps and create sketches on any found piece of paper as I go along my day and then tuck it into the pages of my journal later. Its not the format that matters - it is the doing, the practice of giving yourself space to dream into it everyday that allows the dots to connect and profound insights to emerge. I recommend this text to students in classes I teach."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"This is probably my favorite of the &quot;Madeline&quot; series for kids. Artistically it is beautiful, mixing expressive and energetic line drawings with the occasional full-color painting quite effectively. The story mixes very comic elements (like the girls all fighting over who will have the dog sleep on their bed, while their harried nurse keeps getting up in the night as always) and elements of true poignancy, like when the dog is lost. We see Madeline in her window looking at the empty streets, sighing &quot;Oh Genevieve, where can you be? Genevieve, please come back to me.&quot; The direct, sad, but unsentimental tone of this moment is really moving. Overall, a most satisfying tale indeed, both in story and in art, with a happy ending that is sure to please."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"My sisters and I loved this book when we were small and I'm having fun reading this book to my little one. Poor Madeline, always ornery, never learning, falls into a river and a dog rescues her. It's very sweet to see how the girls fight over the dog but, when she gets out one night and returns, there was enough \\"hound to go around,\\" as the book says when dear Genevieve has a litter of puppies, one for each girl. This is a darling classic and quite worthy of the Caldecott Award it received."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"Madeline's Rescue is about a little girl named Madeline who lives in a shelter with 12 other girls. She was not afraid of anything until one day she fell in the water, and a dog jumped in and saved her. They decided to keep the dog and name it Genevieve. And the struggles in this story teach kids to stand up for what they believe in even if other people think that you are wrong. Its for kids about 3-7 because its just one of the many wonderful children's books that is a great bedtime story because it never gets old!"},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"If you were to walk up to the first person you met on the street and asked, \\"Are you familiar with the works of Mr. Ludwig Bemelmans?\\", you would probably get a funny stare. If, however, you were to walk up to another person on the street and said, \\"In an old house that was covered with vines lived twelve little girls in two straight lines\\", you might still get a funny stare but at least they might be familiar with darling \\"Madeline\\". Though its author hasn't received much interest over the years, the Madeline books have garnered a great deal of love from many members of the literary world. And of these, the only Caldecott winner was \\"Madeline's Rescue\\".Just as they do every day, the little girls attending a French boarding school (run by the pleasant nun Miss Clavel) take a walk across the Seine. On one day in particular, however, the feisty Madeline (who beyond her near drowning gets short shift in this book) falls into the river and nearly drowns. Thanks to a plucky mongrel nearby, Madeline lives and the dog is adopted by the school. To the dismay of the students, however, several trustees coming for an annual inspection are chagrined that such a dog (a mixed-breed undoubtedly) would be allowed to live in one of their schools. Genevieve (for such is the dog's name) is cruelly turned out into the streets and it's up to the girls to rescue their faithful pup.The book is ostensibly for children, but I suspect it is far more loved by Paris-adoring adults. As the little girls search for their doggy they walk about a variety of well known Parisien sights. Here they search amongst the patrons of the trendy Deux Magots. Yonder you can see them in a breathtaking search across Le Pere-Lachaise. I ask you, in what other picture book are you likely to see a full quote on Oscar Wilde's tomb (not to mention nods to Chopin, Moliere, Balzac, and more)? Bemelmans has a lovely lilting ear for his own prose as well. Just consider the line...\\"Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France,You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\"You just can't beat it. On top of that are some wonderful illustrations. Though most of the book is black on white with yellow, there is always the occasional full page spread that is deftly colored in deep greens and dark blues. On the whole, there is much to love in this book. Beloved for more than fifty years now, it shall continue to be just as loved for centuries to come."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"By this third book in the series, readers know that Madeline is the smallest one of the twelve little girls in two straight lines who live in an old house in Paris that was covered with vines. They know that she is not afraid of mice and that \\"nobody knew so well, How to frighten Miss Clavel.\\" In fact, Ludwig Bemelmans accompanies those familiar words with a simplified version of the same scene accompanying the same words from the original story of \\"Madeline.\\" That is because things happen differently this time, as Madeline slips and falls into the river. \\"Poor Madeline would now be dead, But for a god, That kept its head.\\"\\"Madeline's Rescue\\" is actually more about Madeline's rescuer, the aforementioned dog that \\"dragged her safe from a watery grave.\\" Miss Clavel and the other girls take Madeline and the dog home, and when she turns out the light for the night, there is a fight among the girls as to where the dog should sleep. The dog proves to be clever and helpful and is named Genevieve (rhymes with \\"beef\\"). Things are happy for six months and then comes the day of the annual inspection by the trustees, and these wretched people declare that \\"DOGS AREN'T ALLOWED IN SCHOOL\\" and order Miss Clavel to get rid of \\"it.\\" They are also bigots (Genevieve is \\"of uncertain race\\") and they send Genevieve out into the world.This is where we learn that we were wrong about the title, because it is not about the rescue OF Madeline but the rescue BY Madeline, Miss Clavel, and the other girls. For it is Madeline who jumps on a chair and declares: \\"Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France, You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\" This is the best part of the book, because this is where Bemelmans shows his characters searching high and low for their beloved dog in some of the landmark sites in Paris (including Le Pere Lachaise, the celebrated cemetery, where Bemelmans has worked in the final resting places of Oscar Wilde, Rossini, Bizet, Chopin, Sarah Bernardt, Honore Balzac, Hugo, Moliere, Heloise et Abelard, and many more).But we also love the way Bemelmans plays with his familiar storyline, because in the middle of the night when Miss Clavel turns on her light and says, \\"Something is not right,\\" she does it not once and not twice but three times this time around. So there is a happy ending and a happier ending. Actually a perfect ending given all of the fighting and the cutest drawing of the twelve little girls in two straight lines. As always, Bemelmans' childlike illustrations are captivating (and I see a touch of Thurber in his drawings of Genevieve). Any kid can draw a face with dot eyes and U-shaped mouths, and they have to appreciate that Bemelmans does not always color within the lines. But for me it is the full color illustrations of the sights of Paris that I like to look at and catch all of the details. I would love to have a pitcher book that just collects Bemelmans' Paris scenes, even without the rhyming text that is another part of what makes these stories enjoyable and classics of children's literature."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"Madeline's poetic style story continues the life of the charges of Miss Clavel, and especially Madeline, in the old house with vines in Paris. Miss Clavel, who is always so self-possessed has her one moment of total loss and confusion when Madeline falls into the river Seine. While Madeline struggles, a brave, homeless dog boldly rescues her. What follows are the &quot;true to life&quot; jealousies of the other little girls when Madeline adopts the dog and names her Genevive. The girls experiences with Genevive are always a hit with children and the adult who is a child at heart. This beautiful book is a past Caldecott winner!"},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"This is a wonderful story, with wonderful pictures. There are many reviews recapping the story, so I won't do so now. I will tell you that my daughter LOVES this story, and at the age of 2 had memorized every word on every page, and would \\"read\\" it to herself in her crib at night, imitating the voices that I had used when I read it to her. This story, along with all of the other original Madeline stories, should be a permanent addition to any little girl's book collection. It seems like a story that little boys would love as well, as does \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\". I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"I think that this book was a really great book for little kids, It tells how people can be scared of things that can happen. This book was a book that had a really nice lesson in it, and I think that it would most likley be a book that mothers, fathers, ect. can read together with their kids, and enjoy it at the same time. Madeline learned her lesson not to walk on the ledge of the bridge when she fell into the water and almost drowned. If it wasn't for the dog that saved her, she would of not lived! That is why I think that you should read this great book, and you will love it. This is an adventurous book, with lots of picture's and details. The dog who's name is Genevieve was a stray dog, and he was also the one who saved her. He soon after became her bestfriend. All the girls in the school all try to keep the dog from getting taken away from Madeline, even the nun that watched Madeline and the other girls sticked up for the dog. The inspectors came in and tried to take the dog away from the girls, and they were so upset. At the end, they got to keep the dog, and it was a very happy ending. When the author wrote this book, I think that he was thinking about the friendship that someone can have for an animal of any kind, or a person. This book shows alot of that. The kids will also love the surprise ending to the story, because I knoqw that I did. When I read the story, I could not put down the book, not even for one second. This was a great book, and I know that you will love it, and that is why you should get it."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"My 3-year-old-son LOVES Madeline books. This is one is definitely one of his favorites (and, I'll admit it, mine too).Of course Madeline is making Miss Clavel crazy by walking on the rail of the bridge (Since \\"no one knew so well, how to frighten Miss Clavel\\"). When she slips and falls into the river, a brave dog saves her. The girls name her Genevieve and she becomes part of their school. More antics follow, with adorable pictures and clever rhymes. I read the voices of the board of trustees in a fake French, Maurice Chevalier-like accent just for kicks."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"The Madeline series has fascinated children, especially little girls, for decades. Having watched my own children enjoy the books, Madeline's Rescue became my favorite to read to children and to enjoy myself. The book has a marvelous balance of story and outstanding illustrations that make it more complete than almost any other illustrated children's book.My wife and daughters love to quote the beginning of the Madeline books:&quot;In an old house in ParisThat was covered with vinesLived twelve little girlsIn two straight lines.. . .the smallest one was Madeline.&quot;What an engrossing beginning! Why an old house? Why two straight lines? What are the little girls doing there? Why are we focusing on the smallest? Your mind is filled with questions that cause you to want to race forward and learn more.This is a boarding school where the parents do not make an appearance in the story. So you are looking at the independent life of young girls.Madeline's Rescue is the second book in the series. You will probably enjoy the book more if you read Madeline first.One day while walking with the school, Madeline falls into the fast-moving Seine. If you have ever seen the river, you know it would be hard to rescue anyone from it without a boat. In this case, a brave dog saves Madeline. The girls take the dog home and name her Genevieve. They fight over who will sleep with her.All's well until the school's trustees come for their annual inspection. The trustees point out the rule, &quot;DOGS AREN'T ALLOWED IN SCHOOL.&quot; So Genevieve is put out. After the trustees leave, the girls are naturally upset and search all over Paris for her.But Genevieve returns on her own. Miss Clavel awakens in the middle of the night to find her outside. Then Miss Clavel is awakened again when the girls fight over Genevieve. Then, she is awakened a third time for a very nice surprise! You'll have to read the book to find out what it is.Most illustrated books don't hold up well in small paperback form. Madeline's Rescue is the exception. I recommend that you buy a large, library binding edition for home, and the paperback for travel.The illustrations won this book the 1954 Caldecott award for best illustrated children's book in that year. I am sure you will enjoy the bright splashes of color and inked outlines for the happy scenes, and the somber, cold tones for the sad times. If you've ever been in Paris during the wintry weather, the dull looking pages will remind you of those overcast, dull days.After you finish reading this book with your child, I suggest that you think about where else our connection with animals brings rewards in both directions.

I especially enjoyed this story because I love dogs and this particular story touched me at a very small age. Madeline is a very adventurous little girl who doesn't let anything get in the way of what she believes is the right thing to do. It is an innocent book that can help a young child to become more outgoing and take risk in order to achieve what they would like out of life. It is a fun and silly book to read to a child. Even reading it as an adult I found myself laughing out loud at the little things the characters do and say in the story. I would definitely recommend reading this book to any child whether they are or aren't already animal lovers."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"Can someone please post and let me know if this includes the book?

Madeline's Rescue. New York: Viking Press, 1953. One day, Madeline, the smallest and most daring girl in a French boarding school, falls in the river and a dog, Miss Genevieve, comes to her rescue. Each girl in the school adores Miss Genevieve when she comes to live with the girls. The headmasters unfortunately find the dog in the girls' room during an inspection and Miss Genevieve must leave. After a long search for the dog with no results, the girls return home disappointed, and to their surprise, Genevieve shows up with a new litter of puppies for the girls to share. The whole book intrigues and keeps attention because of the way Bemelmans has designed the images and pictures. The book itself relies on the illustrations that accompany the text. Starting with the title page, the title shown in large letters at the top of the page. The author and illustrator's names appear smaller at the bottom of the page. The first and last pages of the book show a picture of the girls' school in a frame, as if we were looking in from the outside. The frame around the outside focuses attention on the center of the page. Bemelmans uses yellow backgrounds with people and objects drawn in black outlines for of the book. Yellow contrasts well with the black used in the outlines, and this makes yellow a good bright background color. A couple of the pages have other brighter colors. These pages have darker, deep blues and reds. They are used for the sad times in the story, like when Madeline falls in the river and is sick and when the girls are looking for the lost dog. One full-page picture in the book centers on a part of the story when Madeline jokingly, falls in the river, and the dog first comes to her rescue. The whole story actually begins at this exciting event. The words and their placement in the book also have an important position in the story. All the words run along the bottoms of the page, where the eyes naturally read. The sentences all flow together because of their placement. The story does not become choppy, as if the words jumped all over the pages. Also, the words rhyme, which makes the story more fun and natural to read. At one point in the story, the words do not rhyme: at the introduction of Miss Genevieve. Maybe the author is trying to point out the introduction of another main character. The reader should realize that special attention should be brought to this detail. All together, the words and illustrations in the book work together to make a natural, flowing, fun story.

Nobody knows how quite to scare Miss Clavel, until Madeline tripped and fell. A dog keeps his head, and helps Madeline before she's dead (that's what it says, I'm not making it up). Of course, Miss Clavel allows the girls to keep the dog, and when Lord Cucuface inspects their house, it's goodbye dog, yet the girls search Paris until they find the dog. Unfortunately, an all-out war with pillows and brooms between the girls erupt: they each want the dog for their own. The battle ensues until the dog turns out to be a &quot;SHE&quot; and &quot;SHE&quot; has a present of her own for each of the girls."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"Over ten years separate Ludwing Bemelmans's fabled children's book, \\"Madeline\\" (1939), from the second of what would be six Madeline tales, \\"Madeline's Rescue.\\" Initially published in a magazine in 1951, \\"Madeline's Rescue\\" was published in book form in 1953 and won the Caldecott Medal for the best American picture book for children in 1954. In addition to the bold and mischevous Madeline, this book features two other Bemelmans characters, the dog Genevieve and Lord Cucuface, the president of the board of trustees responsible for the \\"old house in Paris covered with vines.\\"As with so many little girls, Madeline has her own mind and only reluctantly listens and follows directions. On a walk with Miss Clavel and her 11 classmates, Madeline falls of a rail into the Seine River and is \\"dragged safe from a watery grave\\" by the heroics of Genevieve. The dog is adopted by the girls and becomes an adored pet. But during the annual inspection, Lord Cucuface shoos the dog away: \\"Go away and don't come back!\\"; to which the undaunted Madeline responds:\\"Lord Cucuface beware!/ Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France,/You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\"After a search hither and yon through Paris, Genevieve reappears and the twelve little girls fight over her. Three times, Miss Clavel rises from her bed, exclaiming \\"Something is not Right!\\" But the story works out in the end.The illustrations in the book, in the spontaneous, sketchy yellow, black and white that became a \\"Madeline\\" trademark richly deserved the Caldecott medal, with portrayals of the pompous Cucuface, Madeline's solemn declaration, standing on a chair, of VEN-GE-ANCE, the panicked flights of Miss Clavel,and Genevieve and her relationship with the little girls.The original \\"Madline\\" and this first follow-up story remain for me the best of the Madeline tales. I have been having a lovely time with my four year old granddaughter reading these stories. Madeline, with her mischief and eclat, is among the characters in children's literature that can be enjoyed by youngsters and adults alike.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"Madeline's Rescue, with stories and pictures by Ludwig Bemelmans, is just one of the many adored Madeline books published before. The book having darling characters such as Ms.Clavel, Madeline, and Lord Cucuface is wonderful to read to children having their full-out attention with humorous situations that Madeline usually leaps herself into.As always, in the beginning, Madeline and her fellow orphans leave the house in Paris, \\"in two straight lines, in rain or shine.\\" The day takes a twist as Madeline falls into the Seine. But before Madeline met her fate, a dog came and saved her. The girls beg to keep the dog, and Ms.Clavel says its ok. They name it Genevieve. It acted almost as one of the girls. \\"She could sing and almost talk, and enjoyed their daily walk.\\" Although frowns come upon the little girls faces as the collection of trustees came for the annual inspection. They were not pleased with the dogs and shooed him away quickly. With bravery Madeline declares a search for the dog.The book keeps children's emotions high as Madeline is saved, but then the dog gets taken away. Its cute and I think even parents enjoy reading various Madeline books."},{"Title":"Madeline's Rescue","review":"There are several reviews of this book which explain the storyline.

But, when she is rescued by a courageous little dog, it is the start of an adventure for all of the girls!This is another great Madeline story.

I was also an enlisted man from that war. His book, Stalking the Dragon, catches perfectly the enlisted man's attitude and disposition while serving over there. His main character, Michael Butler was like any other enlistee, just trying to get through his 365 without causing too many waves and at the same time trying to make his time as comfortable as possible. But, because officers are officers, they couldn't stand to see someone of such low rank get something that they weren't, he becomes their sacrificial goat. From here they make him jump to their tune or pay the consequences. As the story progresses Butler finds himself in situations that he couldn't possibly have imagined on the day he raised his right hand and took the oath. I liked this book very much. It kept my interest throughout. There were times I wanted to race ahead to find out how a problem turned out because the suspense was so intense althouge I never did. I laughed several times from knowing how Butler felt in certain situations. If you were ever in the service you would enjoy Stalking the Dragon. If you were in during the Vietnam era you would enjoy it even more. Jorgenson is a good story teller. Like many people who have been in difficult situations, he adds humor to make it more bearable. Buy it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Stalking the Dragon","review":"You are taken on a trip into the surreal as the author opens a pandora's box of &quot;what ifs&quot;.

Along the way, they rediscover their closeness, which blossoms into something far deeper and more complex.Amy has recently escaped a verbally abusive husband and is committed to building a secure life for herself and Becky the only way she knows how--pursuing a big-city career with dogged determination.

But it's not enough for Daniel, whose father was physically abusive. Daniel is holding everything inside, and unless he confides in someone, his horrible father stands a good chance of regaining custody.I loved this book for its many complex issues, and I agonized with Amy over what was the right thing to do.

It was the first I read about the second week after we lost her, and it changed my perspective very early on. We were immersed in grief and could barely tread water at that point, so hope was not even on my mind. But this book gave me hope immediately when I read about the truths of where our daughter was-instantly in the glorious presence of our Father. And it gave me pause to consider something huge...her salvation is sealed and we WILL be joining her in heaven one day, for all eternity we will for sure be with at least one of our children!!!

Anything from utter hatred to sheer delight. That said, I am quite disappointed in those reviewers who said such caustic things concerning the author of this book. John MacArthur has served the Lord for more years than most of the reviews have been alive and yet they seem to think that they have the inside track on God's mind. That said, I am very pleased to recommend this wonderful little book. John MacArthur does not approach any writing opportunity lightly and this is certainly the case here. My wife and I recently said goodbye to our first child before it was born. We got the heart wrenching news when our child was at 15 weeks. I will never forget the whirlwind of emotions that my wife and I experienced as we were in the labor and delivery room for 18 hours waiting for our deceased child to be born. We had been praying for years that the Lord would bless us with a child and then once my wife finally did get pregnant, the child didn't live anymore than fifteen weeks. It is in times like that that the Christian needs the unshakable stability of God's Holy Word. I am a pastor and the people in our church were looking very closely at us during this situation to see how we would handle it. After all, I have always counseled the people of our church to trust the Lord and be in His Word when the trials come. Now they wanted to see if we practiced that same counsel. John MacArthur's careful exposition of God's Word and His graceful presentation of the truth it contains was a wonderful help. It is abundantly evident that John cares and infinitely more evident that our God cares. Every pastor and every Christian needs to own this book. There are times when we need to be reminded that God is gracious and good and kind and He knows what He is doing.

Yet we know that the Scriptures give hope to dying man - there is salvation through repentance and trust in Jesus' death for your sins. But is the heavenly hope a reality for children (and adults) who, simply due to an intellectual inability, have never been able to comprehend their sinfulness and the message of the gospel?John Macarthur tackles this important question in his small book 'Safe in the arms of God' by affirming that such people instantly go to heaven. And this is not simply Macarthur's opinion. It is backed by Biblical evidence.In an initial chapter Macarthur carefully teaches that God knows and loves every child. He then shows that God regards children as innocents (using proof texts from Ezekiel, Jonah, Jeremiah) until they reach an age of moral culpability. He also describes heaven and answers the question of whether you will know your child in heaven. The book then ends with wise counsel on why God allows children to die and how to minister to those grieving the loss of a child.All Christians should be prepared for the day when they, or someone close to them, may lose a child. This book will help prepare you for that day so that you may be able to respond Biblically to God's decision to take away the child."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"My daughter loved the book.

You don't see too many on this topic, and MacArthur explores it well. He is biblical, candid, and is not sentimental when it comes to deal with this sensitive and tear jerking subject. Yet it does have immense power. It provides hope. For those who have lost children, or even those who are parents, should read this book. It's great to know stuff like this, because the wisdom might come in handy someday.

This has been a question posed to me by skeptics and prospects alike during evangelism and even bible study groups. It's surprising how people answer in one of two ways: either they say they don't know and we can't know for sure, or babies do go to heaven yet the Christians can't theologically explain why. This book finally answers that question with good biblical support by John MacArthur.Even though it's one of John's smaller and less well known books, the impact of this work is just as big as some of his more known publications. It explores this sensitive, solemn topic using amazing stories and biblical analysis. It's the first MacArthur book to actually bring me to tears (because some of the accounts were just so moving), and this is something I never thought a John MacArthur book could do! And this book didn't aim to be sentimental to begin with. It's just candid and frank exposition of a topic that just so happened to move because of its raw power and promise from God.I highly recommend this book. It'll be a great gift to anyone, regardless if they are parents or single people. It's really that impactful, and can give Christians great wisdom to encounter such problems or even give encouragement to grieving parents.

John MacArthur lets us know, through scripture readings, that God turely holds these babies and children safe with him in Heaven. I know that one day I will be reunited with my 4 1/2 month old son (along with my other children) in Heaven and I will never have to leave them again. I look forward to the day when I can join them in Heaven, but until then, John MacArthurs book reassures me that they are safe and perfect and that nothing can ever hurt them.If you are looking for a book about the truth of God and Heaven for little ones, then this is it. You will not be disappointed with this book at all!"},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"Safe in the Arms of God is described on the cover as \\"truth from heaven about the death of a child.\\" In this short, but intense book, John MacArthur answers the question of what happens to children - those unborn, stillborn, or youngsters - when they die. This is a question that has perplexed Christians since the days of the early church. While most Christians have held the view that their children are in heaven, the majority have believed that without being able to adequately defend their position. In this book MacArthur provides a Biblical examination of the issues and ultimately provides a satisfying answer.In this short review I will not examine the issue itself, but MacArthur's handling of the issue.MacArthur's position is that all children who die, regardless of the era they were born in, their nationality or the religion of their parents, are immediately ushered into heaven. When Larry King interviewed him in the aftermath of September 11, he asked MacArthur what happened to any children who lost their lives in the tragedies. His answer was (and remains) \\"instant heaven.\\" While that answer was all King wanted, inquiring minds are intrigued by the Biblical grounds for such a view. The author spends several chapters carefully crafting his argument. He gives examples from the Bible which show that there is some assurance that children can be taken to heaven (David's son is the common example) and provides a mountain of other important evidence. Most of this, while it helps build the case, does not prove anything on its own.Essentially, though, the argument comes down to this: salvation is by grace, damnation by works - most notably the action of rejecting God. Infants are incapable of rejecting or accepting God, and thus God chooses to extend His mercy to them. It is important to note that God saves them not on the basis of justice but on the basis of His grace.After making the argument, MacArthur spends several chapters speaking about whether parents will see and know their children in heaven, why the child had to die and what others can do to help grieving parents. The book is interspersed with the stories and testimonies of parents who have suffered a loss and have taken comfort in God's promises.MacArthur makes a compelling, Biblical argument to support the idea that all children who die in infancy are saved by the great mercy of God and are safe for eternity in the arms of a loving God. I give it my recommendation."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"Often, when speaking of the death of an infant, the pastor's heart and the theological mind tend to be at odds with one another. Pastors or counselors may feel forced to give answers they don't believe simply to comfort a grieving parent in a crisis situation. Dr. MacArthur shows that this need not be the case. He uses Scripture to give hope to grieving parents, pastors and counselors who are forced to deal with the death of infants.Though the concepts found in this book are intensely theological, Dr. MacArthur's presentation is easily accessible to any reader. Known as a student and teacher of Scripture, John MacArthur's words are firmly rooted in biblical truth, and offer hope from Scripture that the eternal destiny for all infants is, \\"instant heaven.Few people have not been touched directly by the death of an infant, making the topic relevant to every reader. Dr. MacArthur does a fantastic job of balancing the raw emotion involved in the death of a child with the stark biblical realities of sin and corruption. His simple approach to handling this issue reveals his pastor's heart and theological mind working together to provide comfort from Scripture to those who seek answers to this difficult question."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"My wife and I lost our precious daughter Hope after only thirty mintues with her. I knew a little about what the bible teaches on the subjects and where to find the basics, so I knew that she was with God. I still I found this book to be extremely helpful in fleshing out the whole topic and answering some questions I could not find the answers to on my own. I especially admired how Dr. MacArthur relied on Scripture for his entire argument. There was no wishful thinking in this volume just sound biblical teaching.A warning: If you have recently lost a little one this book is hard to read because of the sad stories.A plug: However, this book is worth reading when you are ready."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"If you're looking for a book to comfort a grieving parent or if you yourself are grieving, I highly recommend this book. I have four babies in Heaven(3 miscarriages and 1 fullterm stillbirth), and it seems as if I've received nearly every book published on pregnancy loss. None of the other books are as theologically sound and as gently written as MacArthur's text. As I read this book, I'm thrilled to know that God cares very deeply about my grief and that reassures me through His Word.You won't be disappointed in this book. It's hopeful, coherent, and grounded."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"My wife and I rushed to the emergency room early last week for what the doctors are calling \\"threatened miscarriage.\\" When I asked myself, \\"What would happen to our baby if he/she died,\\" I couldn't give an answer from Scripture that I was convinced was God's position on the matter. As I asked myself the question, I had to honestly respond, \\"I don't know.\\" My hope is that all would go to heaven, even though we're all fallen, but that means very little if that's not how God sees it. MacArthur writes in the second chapter regarding our approach in answering that question\\"When we look into the grave of a little one, we must not place our hope or trust in a false promise, in an unbiblical theology, in the instability of sentimentalism, or in the cold analysis of human logic. Rather, we must look to what God's Word has to say on the matter.\\"John MacArthur spends 170 short pages trying to do just that, look to God's Word on the matter. When he does so he responds as he did on Larry King Live when asked the same question: \\"Instant heaven.\\"The book may not read like a typical \\"mourning\\" book. It is not full of well-intentioned, positive platitudes whose sole intention is to bring comfort with little though of what is true or not. No, the point throughout the book is to say, \\"This we know is true, take comfort in this.\\" This is the approach we must take. Comfort devoid of truth is deception; comfort rooted in truth yields true peace. That being said that book is appropriate and comforting; not the theology of classrooms or studies, but the theology of the knowledge of God who is active in all of our life. If you have lost a child, may lose a child, or know anybody who has, I do recommend this book.He biblically grounds his argument in the personhood of babies from conception. While admitting a level of inherent sinfulness before God present in all humans, he writes on page 35, \\"Every infant or child who dies before reaching a condition of moral culpability goes instantly to heaven at death.\\" Therefore, children are treated as \\"innocents\\". Still, being sinners and not righteous, the baby is dependent on God's grace, which He gives freely to all babies and young children (and mentally handicapped). So \\"children are saved by grace, but cannot be damned by works\\" because they cannot assess those works to be against God, MacArthur teaches. Therefore, just as David stopped mourning when his baby died in 2 Samuel 12:23 and had hope that he would be united to him after death, we do not have to mourn because believing parents will be united to their babies after death as they are both spending eternity in the joy of the presence of God. Finally, the book ends with some chapters about what heaven will be like, particularly for babies who die. He also tackles the question of \\"Why did my baby have to die?\\"There is certainly still some mystery involved as God's Word does not speak specifically to this question. Nevertheless, I know that God is good and God is sovereign. So regardless of what happens, I can rest without anxiety that my little baby's fate whether he or she is still in the whom, whether he or she dies, or whether he or she grows up to maturity that his future is in the hands of my loving, self-giving, merciful, just, and sovereign God.I must say that I am not convinced by much of what MacArthur writes. Upon finishing the book, I must say that my answer to my original question is still largely, \\"I don't know.\\" I think Wayne Grudem has some good advice regarding this question from his book Systematic Theology (p.499).\\"But then what do we say about infants who die before they are old enough to understand and believe the gospel? Can they be saved?\\"Here we must say that if such infants are saved, it cannot be on their own merits, or on the basis of their own righteousness or innocence, but it must be entirely on the basis of Christ's redemptive work and regeneration by the work of the Holy Spirit within them. \\"There is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus\\" (1 Tim. 2:5). \\"Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God\\" (John 3:3).Regarding the children of unbelievers who die at a very early age Scripture is silent. We simply must leave that matter in the hands of God and trust him to be both just and merciful. If they are saved, it will not be on the basis of any merit of their own or any innocence that we might presume that they have. If they are saved, it will be on the basis of Christ's redeeming work; and their regeneration, like that of John the Baptist before he was born, will be by God's mercy and grace. Salvation is always because of his mercy, not because of our merits (see Rom. 9:14-18). Scripture does not allow us to say more than that.\\"So why can I recommend this book if I'm not convinced by each and every one of its arguments? In no way am I saying that I think babies don't go to heaven. I believe the Bible is silent on the topic so we shouldn't speak with the complete confidence of MacArthur on the issue (who said in dismay on page 13, \\"How can a person be a pastor and not have an answer to that question?\\") as if the Bible speaks more definitively than it does on the issue. Nevertheless, the Bible is full of clues as to how God will deal with the child. John Piper, in his \\"Funeral Meditation for Owen Glenn Shramek\\" says\\"Our confidence that Owen is safe and uncondemned is not that he was innocent, but that he was forgiven and he was counted righteous because of Jesus Christ. The Bible is very plain that we are saved from our sin and from God's punishment by grace through faith in Jesus Christ who died in our place and rose again from the dead.\\"But what about tiny children who do not yet have the physical ability to even know the basic facts of the gospel or even of any of God's revelation in nature? Does the Bible teach that God will judge them in the same way that he will judge an adult who consciously rejects the truth of God that he knows?\\"No, there are clues that God does not condemn those who are physically unable to know the truth that God has revealed in nature or in the gospel. I'll mention two clues.One comes from Deuteronomy chapter one. God is angry because the people would not trust him to help them take the promised land. They rebelled against him. So he says, \\"Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers [except Caleb and Joshua, who had trusted him].\\" Then he adds a word about the children: \\"And as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it\\" (vv. 35, 39).\\"Not having the \\"knowledge of good and evil\\" takes away the judgment. They were not yet physically able to know what they needed to know, and so God does not sweep them away with the adults who wouldn't trust God.\\"The second clue confirms this principle from the New Testament. It's found in Romans 1:18-21. The text is not about children, but the same principles of justice apply. Listen to the relationship between having available knowledge and having accountability. \\"What can be known about God is plain to [men], because God has shown it to them. For ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made. Therefore they are without excuse; for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him.\\"\\"The point is this: to be held accountable at the judgment you need two things: 1) available knowledge of the glory of God whom you should have adored and thanked; 2) the physical ability to know it, to perceive it. If this knowledge were really not available, then, Paul implies, there really would be an \\"excuse\\" at the judgment. No adult, except perhaps profoundly retarded or mentally ill ones, have this excuse. That's Paul's point. We adults are without excuse. But children are in another category. They do have this excuse. They don't have the physical ability to know what God has revealed. Therefore we believe that God will apply to them the blood and righteousness of Christ in a way we do not know. We adults can have this pardon and righteousness only through faith. That is the clear teaching of Scripture (Ephesians 2:8; Romans 3:28 ). How are infants united to Christ? We don't know. And speculation would not help us here.\\"We leave it at this: Owen Shramek will glorify Christ all his everlasting days for salvation by grace on the basis of the death and righteousness of Christ. There is no other name under heaven by which he could be saved. Jesus Christ will get all the honor for Owen's salvation.\\"So based on the Biblical clues that MacArthur so thoroughly and thoughtfully presents to ground our hope in truth, if my baby were to die... I believe it would be \\"Instant heaven\\". I can say with 100% confidence, I trust God to do what would glorify Him most, and for that I trust and long."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"I received a review copy of this book after we lost our son prematurely (he was 23 1/2 weeks).

I wanted concrete answers not just socially acceptable encouragement. This book goes into very good detail on biblical passages relating to infant and child death. I did not like how it started (sounded arrogant) but after getting into it I believe the author has done good research. I also did not really need all the sad, personal stories in such detail, but others may appreciate that.

While I've found comfort in other books, none impacted me as profoundly as this single resource. The solid, Scriptually grounded answers struck a cord in my soul that brought greatly needed comfort and assurance.

Truth is truth. Truth is found in what the Bible says about an issue. MacArthur poses the question, how do you know children, regardless of their stage of development, go to heaven? On what basis do you respond? Does the Bible address the issue of babies going to heaven?There is comfort in that the answers on these matters are in the affirmative. In a scholarly study of the subject, Dr. MacArthur provides answers from God's Word. The author comes across as more than a world class Bible scholar, which he is. Some of the contributions come from people he's pastored. He's lived through these heart-wrenching experiences with these precious people.

A comfort during the worst time of our lives. Would definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"I have never had a doubt in my mind that babies and young children that die go to heaven. To me, it has always been a matter of common sense. Just knowing about God's character has always been proof enough for me. His divine grace knows no bounds. His mercy is greater than His wrath. Coming to earth in human form to die for our sins, even though we don't deserve it, is the greatest proof of this. Therefore, I have always believed that His grace covers those that have not yet developed the intelligence to distinguish between right and wrong. However, I wanted my beliefs to be based on more than just my own intuition. I wanted Scriptural proof beyond the concepts of God's unfailing love and all encompassing grace. Unfortunately, I am no theologian. As such, I often need help in looking for the answers I seek within Scripture. Thankfully, John MacArthur has published this well-researched and theologically sound book on the subject of infant death.MacArthur points to Scripture after Scripture that prove that infants instantly go to heaven when they die. If you had any doubt on this subject before, your doubt will fade away after reading this excellent and comforting book.Of course, there are those that have the opposite opinion. Some believe that since we are all born into a sin nature, that if we have not had a chance to except Christ into our hearts, then we are lost forever. This, of course, includes children. However, this totally discounts the saving grace of God. God's grace is so much bigger than we ever realize. It is not limited to our feeble understanding of His ways. Personally, I can't imagine being under leadership within a church that espouses the teaching that infants who die go directly to hell. It is unfathomable to me how anyone can believe this. It seems very contradictory to what Scripture shows us to be true.Then, there are those who have decided that Scripture does not say anything on the subject. Therefore, the truth of the matter can not be known to us. We are to just trust that God will do what is right. However, it seems to me that this is just a cop-out. While it's true that we should always put our faith in God to do what is right (he is a good God!), He has also given us His Scripture for study and meditation. He does have something to say to us on this subject and it is our responsibility to diligently study His Word to know the Truth. Even if this means we must go outside of ourselves and seek guidance from those that have more wisdom on Scriptural concepts than we do."},{"Title":"Safe in the Arms of God: Truth from Heaven About the Death of a Child","review":"I probably own every single MacArthur book and several copies of many. I even own the $400 commentary collection. When I read MacArthur, I expect for the most part, Biblical verses to be taken in context.However, when I read this book of his, I was floored at how many scriptures are torn completely out of context. MacArthur promoting (or at least extremely close to teaching) the Arminian false doctrine of Age of Accountability in this book. He speaks of innocent children. You can find his sermons on GTY that also mirror this same false teaching. He declares that children are innocent until an unknown age. And that ALL children are saved. The normal Biblical belief is that we can trust that elect children are saved. And we can rest in the hope that if they die early, our Christian children are saved. But the Bible teaches against all children being saved. King David speaks of being wicked from conception.

Because unlike the nebulous \\"age of accountability\\", I DO have a scripture to support this truth: Christ is the Savior of ALL people, especially those who believe. Doesn't say a few or some or the elect, no-it says all.So we are left with a choice. We can either love God or we can fear God but we can't do both.

Being a Christian, I have an odd view of this book,as I believe there is a case for Christian education, but not at the EXPENSE of education. This book outlines the pitfalls awaiting the student of a Christian school. In high school the only literature I read (other than the Bible) was Beowulf. The Bible and Beowulf was my ENTIRE literature foundation! I read no Shakespeare or Chaucer or Steinbeck. The emphasis on the spiritual life of presidents and lack of what they actually accomplished in office was another downfall. This book is pretty accurate in what it describes!

All of the textbooks discussed are from Bob Jones University or A Beka Books. There are many Christian schools who do not use these textbooks, so this book is a real eye-opener on what is being taught in those schools besides the Bible.Bob Jones textbooks are extremely anti-Catholic. One of the history books discussed here claims that England defeated Spain because God supported Protestantism over Catholicism. I guess all those naval tactics and shipbuilding techniques were no match for God mucking with the weather. The same book often describes English and Scottish peoples in positive terms while condemning populations from Catholic countries. These attitudes will be instilled in children using the books, and that is the idea.While this book did an excellent job calling out the more shocking attitudes found in these books, it read rather incompletely to me. It seemed as if it needed more fleshing out. A deeper discussion into some of the different approaches of fundamentalist school textbooks would have been helpful, as they are not all the same and do not use the same approach. But the book is very helpful for parents choosing a school; after reading it they can then ask to see the textbooks used before enrolling their child."},{"Title":"Visions of Reality","review":"This book was recommended reading on an atheist website, though there is information in this book that will be of interest to others, particularly Christians who do not fall under the 'fundamentalist' umbrella.

FUN-- i like the tiny German-English sub-dictionary included in my unabridged English Language dictionary for Random House, for giving many old meanings for words that help me see the LINKAGES historically from German to English. For example, the german word \\"sack\\" is listed as as we expect, a bag, but also included \\"to plunder\\", also true in English. If we have a word that both sounds and is used similarly, it's nice that's made clear. My hope? That this much bigger volume will be much the same (have not ordered yet).A German-English dictionary should let you interpret printed reading material correctly, but no dictionary can prepare you for the marked and myriad regional variations in pronouncing German words. i think the Brothers Grimm attempted to catalogue them all. The result was an amazing 16 volumes, with the last one not verified for printing until around 1960.(2). PRONUNCIATIONS OF SPECIFIC WORDS MISSING. There is no one Germany, language-wise. Even after a bunch of principalities joined together in the later 1800s to make the main Germany, with a different dialect for each ex-principality included, the ones left out, but still speaking Germanm ranged from Luxembourg to Austria. It would be unclear which one of many dialects should have its pronunciation used. The spellings have been standardized so primted material means the same to all, even though the spoken sound of words vary.(3). LEARN RULES IF WORRIED. Across dialects, however, there are general rules governing the part of pronunciation that is shared, making the dialects all German. If you know those fairly simple rules, you're set to test German tolerance of each other's, and thus YOUR, dialect.There's no J sound used in any of \\"the many Germanies\\", so Josef is pronounced Yosef everywhere. Thi salo means that the myriad German-speakers have never, ever called themselves German/Jerman. A W is pronounced as a V, and a V, as an F. Thus, the surname Witt might be pronounced vitt, and Veronica seems to be feronica. A \\"final e\\" is always pronounced, unlike in English, but whether the river Elbe would be pronounced elba or elbee varies regionally. A B can turn into a P sound in some places but not others.

While Hodges and Hyman give essentially the last one-sixth of the first book of the poem, Sandol Stoddard Warburg and Pauline Baynes give the complete story of Una and her knight, glossing over only such details as would be unsuitable for young readers and listeners. Warburg tells the tale in verse, beginning with simple unrhymed lines, but gradually moving to a fairly close approximation of the original Spenserian stanzas. Baynes' dozens of monochrome line drawings are a far cry from Hyman's lushly colorful visualizations, but her celebrated work as illustrator for C. S. Lewis's Narnia Chronicles and some of J. R. R. Tolkien's shorter works (notably \\"Bilbo's Last Song\\") suggests how well-suited she was for depicting this type of fantasy-adventure. For older children, especially those who may eventually transition to reading Spenser on their own, this version can be heartily recommended."},{"Title":"A History of Housing in New York City","review":"If you can only buy one book about housing in the USA (this isn't just for those interested in NYC), this is the one to buy.

From the earliest dwellings to highrise towers in the park, the book tackles important social and design trends. Robert Moses of course comes in for a bow but all that underpinned his vast reshaping of NYC is detailed. You want floor plans? It's got floorplans galore. My one quibble is that it ends in the early 90s and so much as happened since then.

While that may grab your attention, what keeps it is Dean's delusional status.Told from the point of view of 5 characters (Dean, Bucella, Phillip, Ginny & Alice), all the characters weave in & out of each other's lives in a strange dance, searching for the meaning of life. Well, if not the meaning of life, searching for something more significant than what they have. Well, if you don't buy that metaphoric crap, then this is a search for God & sex.God & sex are pitted against each other, mistaken for each other, and viewed as means to one another. Some obsess on God's ways, while some abstain from God's ways. Some abstain from sex, some are reborn in sex. Some abstain from God & sex. Some believe the are The Savior because of sex. Some believe in math as The Savior, but have diaphragms anyway.The author has created the truly bizarre, but it's all plausible. It's epic & fantastic, yet each character is so rooted in some clinical state that you suddenly feel that it's all too real. It's sharp & biting, cruel when necessary, and while this certainly exposes the soft underbellies of the people, they retain if not dignity (and I must say, there may be indignant characters, there isn't much dignity!), some sense of respect or warmth, for Millet never goes in for the kill. Well, technically, since there is death, she does kill, but, oh what the hell -- this book is full of contradictions, humor & irony. Above all it's absolutely captivating.I picked it up, read it almost in one day -- and I was pissed when I had to stop. 'Everone's Pretty' is fast & furious reading that nearly hypnotizes.This is Lydia Millet's third book If it was inspired by her work at Larry Flynt Publications, I say give her a new job every 6 months, & let her write some more!(Condensed Review)"},{"Title":"Everyone's Pretty: A Novel","review":"Everyone's Pretty is a great read. Millet's prose is fun and engaging, clever and insightful. The characters and storyline are reminiscent of Tom Robbins and Carl Hiaasen, and the protagonist, Dean Ducetes and his midget cohort, Ken, could have found their way from one of Bukowski's works. Sex and religion and the collateral damage that comes from living in LA are prevalent themes of the novel. Ducetes, a hedonist nonpareil, is a self-anointed messiah, while his sister Bucella, pure and nave as they come, is a follower of Christ, devoted like no other. In rapid succession, through a series of narrative vignettes, they and the story's wayward cast of other eclectics undergo a variety of haphazard encounters and off-the-wall scenarios that keep the reader entertained and laughing. Grab yourself a copy and get reading."},{"Title":"Everyone's Pretty: A Novel","review":"What a fantastic little book! Not only is it a very funny read, but the characters are so richly drawn that they'll stay with you for quite a while. A couple of weeks after reading the book, I still find myself contemplating who should play each character if it is ever made into a movie. Now I know that it's doubtful that this \\"under the radar\\" gem would ever make it to the silver screen, but I couldn't help imagining either Phillip Seymour Hoffman or Jack Black as the vulgar, yet magnetic personality of Dean Descetes. Give this book a try, I guarantee that you'll be quickly passing it along to your friends as a \\"must\\" read."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Pip and Flinx lovers,like me, have been waiting for this book a long time, and perhaps they, like me, hope that the next book will return to the series tradition of adventure, mischief, and fast-paced fun. This novel followed Flinx on his usual quest to discover who he is, who his parents were, and what was done to him in utero to make him what he is. This is usually very interesting, but then it is also usually told along with a separate story, something fun and juicy. This book reads like an excerpt of a bigger novel. It doesn't really end in a way so that you feel you've finished the book. Hard to say since I know the back story, but I'm not sure it really stands alone. I did enjoy reading this book; it gave a lot of insight into Flinx's background and that's always fascinating. But I hope Foster's next Flinx novel has a little more meat."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Did anything important actually happen in this book? I have read and re-read the old Flinx novels so many times they are practically falling apart...what happened!?! A couple of hundred pages to break into a computer, get lost in a desert (I got it, I got it...don't sleep without looking around first!), and meet your sister on a ship hidden as a moon. Could have been done in a 30 page novella. I feel bad for anyone who dished out the cost of a hardcover for this book....at least I know that if another one comes out five years from now I'll borrow that one from the library too!"},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I liked this book because of what it reveals about Flinx's past and what new questions it brings up. Some of the descriptions I felt were too long, but the was very well written. I can't wait to start the next book in the series. Anyone who has enjoyed the previous books in the series should read this one. Be aware that it has no chapter demarcations. I notice that the next book in the series does, so that is a nice change of enhancement. I won't bore you with a plot summary because other reviewers are fond of including that. I still hope that in the future books Flinx is allowed to find a life beyond the constant searching for his origins. It's almost sad \\"watching\\" him go through everything he experiences because hardly any of it is happy. However, that's part of what makes it such an engaging read."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Why have I aged from a twelve year old kid when I first read Tar-Aiym Krang to thirty-seven while Flinx is only six years older? It doesn't seem fair... But anyhow, this continuing adventure of Pip and Flinx is typical old school sci-fi page turner stuff. The inside cover sites a Locus review that states that this book \\"make(s) for a good read\\". That's not exactly earth-shattering high praise, but it's fair and accurate. If Alan Dean Foster's writing didn't have a special nostalgic place in my heart, I would probably trash this book, but come on, it's Pip and Flinx - what's not to love?"},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Reunion is certainly the weakest of the Pip and Flinx novels I've read. It starts well, with Flinx finding out that he's capable of being not-so-nice when necessary, but tends to fall into a one-thing-after-another novel as it progresses.This novel feels rather like a short story with filler. Pip and Flinx fans should certainly read it, as it develops Flinx's understanding of the Meliorare society and himself (although, as is traditional, it raises more questions). Besides, after such a long wait, anything will be a nice read. If you have never read a Pip and Flinx novel, however, *please* don't start with this one - you'll get entirely the wrong idea about this charming series."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"It's long-awaited, and it brings the agendas of the wide question of &quot;what is Flinx here for?&quot; another step forward.Unfortunately, it feels like something of a place-holder. It resolves very little, as far as the characters are concerned. Flinx figures out a _little_ more about his family, but that hardly seems to justify a whole novel. He explores an interesting planet, but it seems unlikely that the planet will be of continuing interest. The plants of Midworld apparently get in touch with some other aliens, but none of the characters in the book are aware of this in the slightest; in effect, the _real_ story in the story mostly takes place off-stage.It would have been nice to have some tension added in involving Flinx being reacquainted with some of the Church characters that we actually _liked_, as opposed to just the dysfunctional family members that are rather unlikable.Hopefully the next episode will come along sooner, and be a bit more satisfying."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"When I found that ADF had written another Flinx novel I was quite pleased and anxious to read it. Unfortunately, Reunion was a disappointment. This is clearly not a novel that would make new friends (i.e. readers) for Flinx and Pip. Not that it is a badly written or boring, there just isn't too much there. However, what is there appears to be a prologue to a new cycle for Flinx and Pip. The book appears to be setting the stage for the next few novels in the series, hopefully appearing soon. If my suspicions are correct, it will be quite a trip!There is no particular reason to read this book right now, unless you are desperate for a fix of Flinx. On the other hand, there is no reason not to do so."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"When I picked up the newest in Alan Dean Fosters Flinx series I was very glad that he was continuing with the special duo of pip and Flinx and he adds on to the mystery of One Philip Lynx nee Flinx we are left waiting to find out more about the threat to man and thranx kind from a coming darkness I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"This series is a favorit of mine. each book can stand alone but, when you read all of them it adds to the enjoyment and understanding.

However, I think the book showed adaquately how much Flinx disliked doing what he did. Overall the book was ok, though not the best in the series. I dislike how Foster did the majorly destructive computer trap though. To do something like that, the person who designed those computers would have to have been a complete moron...I also felt that it was odd how Flinx went back to earth to get info, after he already failed the first time going there (and not finding much)"},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I am a Pip &amp; Flinx fan from way, way back. I have all the other novels in the series and do enjoy rereading them periodically. I eagerly awaited my receipt of this one.

I think the idea has a great deal of potential that has never quite materialized. As I said, I enjoyed this novel, but it could have been much better. I was left feeling vaguely unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"It has been a very long time since there has been a Flinx novel. Mid-Flinx was published in 1995. Since that time, Alan Dean Foster has produced a steady stream of work, including several set in the same universe, but references to Flinx and his deadly Alaspinian Mini-Dragon have been non-existent. Some of this probably has to with the rapidity with which the earlier volumes came out. Foster is a good enough author to stop before he has overused a theme..Some things never change. Flinx, now 21, has matured a bit, and his empathic powers have grown as well. Pip is still in the best of health as well. But Flinx is still roaming the universe in Teacher, his starship, and he is still on a quest to discover his true identity and purpose. This time, Flinx has returned to Earth to seek for more information on his origins as an experiment of the banned Meliorare Society. Using his empathic power Flinx convinces a young security staffer to allow him access to the AI of a major data center. From there he is able to penetrate the Earth's data shell and investigate files still under Church ban..Even as Flinx attempts to grasp the last 'sybfile' of information it disappears. He manages to trace the sybfile to a ship leaving the Earth and comes under a deadly 'information attack' aimed at the AI he is using. Flinx is barely able to escape the Data Center in the chaos and it is only luck that gets him safely off planet and on board the Teacher. He is determined to find the sybfile, but the ship Flinx is chasing is headed in the worst direction. Its destination is the planet of Pyrassis, well into the territory of the AAnn Empire, where humans are considered a delicacy..Rapid-fire, the plot gets more and more complicated, as Flinx finds himself crossing the Pyrassian desert on step ahead of death, a near captive of the AAnn, and then thrust back into space for a confrontation of inconceivable magnitude. Although there are moments where the narrative bogs down while Foster takes the time to explain something, the overall impact is of a long and finely detailed chase story. For most readers, the detail about the reptilian Aann will be new territory. Foster has made them quasi-comical, speaking in hissing sibilants with a delicate sarcasm and a very serious understanding of the politics of success in the military..For a couple of reasons, this is a 4-1/2 star novel; not really the five I'm giving it. First is the tendency to go ponderous that I've already mentioned. This happens at moments of scientific explanation, and are over quickly. My other criticism, is that rather than take the time to tie up some of the many loose ends already built into the series, Foster adds even more. Without some cleanup and, perhaps, a slightly more robust publication schedule there is danger that details will begin to conflict more conspicuously than they already do. These flaws are minor, and should not interfere with the reader's enjoyment of the book. &quot;Reunion&quot; stands very well on it's own, but a trip to some of its predecessors is recommended, purely for the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Pip and Flinx. What's not to like?Foster has done his usual workmanlike job of spinning yet another yarn about the adventures of the two, but the story line is a bit thin. Just a bit.

Yes.Do I want more? Definitely!"},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I've been reading Foster's books for many years, and enjoy following the adventures of Flinx and Pip.

Foster totally lost me when he used the word \\"yclept\\". It was so out of place in the context. Lyrical word-pictures when the hero is trying to save his rear gave me mental whiplash. I did finish it, but was left feeling that the story really hadn't advanced much. This was just a way-stop at a motel from hell when I was expecting a nice hotel, ...Hope the next one is better!"},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Definitely the most disappointing Flinx book--I felt like I'd read almost everything that had happened before, witht he sole exception of Flinx's new AAnn encounter.

I have all the other books and have read and reread them multiple times. Most of the book merely rehashes parts and themes from his other books and never manages to create any level of storytelling. The whole story is unsatisfying, especially the conclusion. I think that ADF has hit the wall with regard to the Commonwealth theme bacause all his recent books are very unimpressive. The sophistication and compelling plots are not present in the newer books. I highly recommend all his other P&amp;F but stay as far as you can from this latest installment. I am seriously thinking of donating this book to the library."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I have read all of Foster's past Flinx novels, sometimes twice, and most of his other science fiction and fantasy offerings. This novel is not up to any of his other books, not even close, as if most of it were ghostwritten by someone who had only read his Mid-World, and proceeded from there to come up with 326 pages of sequel. I could not finish it. The plot is comic book, and the verse pallid. A Theasaurus seemed to be the author's major tool, as a few quotes illustrate sadly: (Page 80) &quot;Or comets, or a visitation from a perambulating nebula. Decorative simulacra of anyuthing in the universe were available for the asking.&quot; (Page 92)&quot;Unmonitored glowing consoles beckoned, efficient instrumentation silently declaimed reams of unperused information, and chairs reposed unoccupied.&quot; If anything, I would rent it from a library."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Alan Dean Foster's Flinx and Pip are off adventuring again.

From his adventures on earth, to the near-disaster on a remote AAnn planet inhabited largely by mineral creatures, to a vast alien artifact, Flinx lurches from one set of problems to the next. Fortunately for him (but possibly unfortunately for the reader), Flinx seems to get help from on high whenever he gets in too serious a problem.While I would have preferred to see Flinx solve more of his own problems, I still found it hard to put down this exciting and well written novel...."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. I'd hoped that the author would finally allow Flinx to discover the secrets of his background and his creation. Instead, the book can be summarized by the following: Flinx breaks into Computer Database on Earth to learn about his past; he finds nothing of interest except one file that mysteriously disappears; he follows the trail of the file; finds his sister in a mysterious alien vessel; loses his sister and the file he seeks; learns nothing of interest. What a joke."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I've read all the books in this series, I'm used to Flinx loseing all of his abilities at the start of the next book. This book has plot holes and inconsistancies big enough to fly the Teacher through. It just seems thrown together quickly and not very well thought out. If your die hard Flinx fan like me you'll try to ignore the gapping holes and enjoy the story, if your not I wouldn't bother with it."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting this book since I finshed Mid-Flinx 4 or 5 years ago. It was worth the wait, but I wish Foster would write the Flinx books a little faster. Without spoiling the book for anyone let me just say that it is interesting to see how Flinx is growing as a character. The book overall is a great read. Just like at the end of Mid-Flinx there seems to be more questions left unanswered then answered. I have a few theries as to where the whole end story is heading, but it would only be a guess and I am not even sure if Foster knows where it is going at the moment. If you have read the other Flinx novels then you will like this one. If you are not familiar with them start with one of the others first, I would recomend the Tar-Aiym Krang. It will help fill in some of the history first."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Complete disappointing - I'll just give the two biggest reasons.First, it seems that Mr. Foster just discovered the thesaurus, and wanted to impress us all with lots of obscure words for ordinary events and feelings. It doesn't come across as Flinx maturing and gaining wisdom, but rather as just poor writing.Secondly, the ending is rushed and unsatisfying; it is nothing but a deus ex machina ploy. In fact, it's two of them, and both have been used by Foster in previous Flinx books."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"For those who are into these two of foster's characters this is an excellent read.

There was not much development but a little background is being setup for next book. Unfortunately this book seemed to be a placeholder till the series can evolve in the next book."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"It's been a long time since we had a glimpse of Flinx and Pip, And ADF does not disappoint! This novel picks up quite nicely from where Mid-Flinx left off and aims towards closure. If you have been reading these stories since 1972, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"After an interminable wait, Alan Dean Foster gives us another Flinx and Pip novel. There are quite a lot of firsts: our first visit to an actual AAnn world (and our first meeting with AAnn who are *not* actively engaged in the attempted subjugation of the human race), our first glimpse into the complexities of the Commonwealth computer system, and the first time Flinx actively defies Commonwealth authority instead of merely being elusive. Not to mention properly immense alien artifacts and the long-fated return of a tormented girl with immense powers and even more reason than Flinx to hate the universe. For all these reasons, and more, this book easily earns a four-star rating from me.But as much as I enjoyed reading it, I can't help but think that it is just what it says it is, &quot;another Flinx novel.&quot; I have to wonder, after all the soul-shattering revelations and grim destinies that ADF keeps subjecting his hero to, if he actually intends to resolve the series! If we have to keep waiting five years between Flinx books, it may be several decades before, as it is stated so succinctly on the author's web site, &quot;Flinx turns fifty, the reality and ultimate threat emerging from the Great Emptiness makes itself known to the civilizations of the galaxy, and the Final Confrontation commences.&quot; To put it bluntly, the tone of Reunion falls flat for me. Maybe it's partly the fact that Flinx persists in being so obstinate about retaining his independence from authority, so adamant about being independent. In his persistent mission of self-discovery, he is so obsessed with the plain facts of his life that he completely ignores the subtler but more profound clues that the universe keeps throwing into his life. After a while, it becomes hard for me to empathize. Maybe it's perfect characterization, but in a series as long as this, I am starting to get a little bored with Flinx's stubbornness. Reunion lacks that special, undefinable *something* that was present in earlier Flinx books, leading me to wonder if Alan Dean Foster is losing enthusiasm for his work. I desperately hope not, but this is the main reason that I give the book a four, not a five.I also wonder if the long wait between books is at least partly to blame for some of the odd stutters of continuity between the various novels. For example: in Flinx in Flux, the Teacher (Flinx's marvelous ship) is filled with a garden of exotic plants and Ulru-Ujurrian artifacts. In Midworld, it suddenly becomes spare and utilitarian. In Reunion, it suddenly becomes able to shift itself to any of a variety of exotic displays. In Flinx in Flux, Flinx's ability to *project* emotions--as opposed to merely receiving--suddenly develops by several orders of magnitude. In Midworld, this ability is strangely unmentioned. In Reunion, it is suddenly back, except Flinx seems to have had it (and known about it) for most of his life. Other loose ends in the series remain agonizingly unresolved. When is Foster going to let us know whether Mother Mastiff is still alive? What have the delightful Bran Tse-Mallory and Truzenzuzex been up to, and will we ever see them again? Are the Qwarm (who put in an unexpected and somewhat understated appearance in Reunion) still trying to kill Flinx? Does Clarity come back? What about the redoubtable Maxim Malaika? Skua September? The Xunca? Will they all come together in some ridiculously improbable climax, or will they just dangle loosely for all eternity? Lastly, I cannot help but wonder how, given the immense trouble he is now in with Commonwealth authorities after the events of this novel, our dear Flinx manages to be so nondescript and unruffled eight years later, where he puts in his appearance on Repler to deal with the Vom (Bloodhype, written in 1973).Don't get me wrong - I love this book! But I really wonder how Alan Dean Foster intends to wrap up all his series' loose ends and provide us with a climax worthy of nearly thirty years of thrilling buildup... and if, at his current pace, he will be alive long enough to write it!"},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"The first sci-fi book I read as a kid was Foster's &quot;The End of the Matter&quot;, probably because of the facinating blue pear shaped alien on the cover. I think I could hardly have picked a better sci-fi book to start off with. The Flinx novels have been consistently creative, extremely well written, and a lot of fun to read. The alien worlds are inventive and vividly detailed, the characters are typically believable and interesting, and Foster's Commonwealth is a remarkably optimistic universe which is thankfully free of modern sci-fi literature's cliche's.. (governments that aren't entirely corrupt, religions that aren't singlemindedly dedicated to ignorance and superstition, corporations that aren't just out to rape and pillage??)Unfortunately, this particular novel seems more like a filler. It reads more like the first couple of chapters of one of the better books in the series. You are waiting for the real focus of the story to emerge, then suddenly find yourself with only twenty pages left in the book to read. Worse yet, you discover that instead of the characteristic inventiveness of other books in the series, you are treated to some particularly non-inventive (though larger in scale) elements in this storyline.At the end you are left wondering what happened to the rest of the book, and why Foster seemed to have cut short the story and constructed a rather quick ending that left it feeling unresolved. Perhaps he had another more interesting project on the line and had to wrap this one up right away.In any case, the book is fun and readable, and taken as an interim transition to a more interesting forthcoming story sometime in the future (hopefully), it's not bad. If you're a fan of the series you're sure to like it, though you'll definitely be left a little unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"This is the 8th Pip and Flinx novel, and my least favorite so far. Dealing with Flinx's never-ending search for his personal history, REUNION actually contains several different reunions, as Flinx runs into the AAnn, Mahnahmi, and a little something left behind by a long-vanished civilization. Flinx starts out on Earth seducing his way into a secure records facility, and from there follows the trail of a crucial file all the way into AAnn space--where he finds that the possessor of the file is the mentally talented and morally challenged young girl he last saw on Ulru-Ujurr.The setup of the book is such that the meeting with Mahnahmi is apparently supposed to be a surprise, but only to those who haven't read the editorial reviews above. Frankly, I would have preferred that Flinx come face-to-face with her much earlier in the book. As it is, the first half of the book is fairly dull. Foster seems to have found a new thesaurus, judging from the number of dubious adjectives that sprinkle the pages, but that doesn't make the action any more interesting. MID-FLINX did a much better job describing camouflaged dangers on an unknown world, and had more of a plot to boot.REUNION is surprisingly lacking in interesting characters; the few humans who appear are mere plot devices, lacking any meaningful contribution to the story. The cynical and ambitious AAnn, when they appear in the narrative, are far more plausible than the humans.The rush of action at the end of the book hints that more sequels are upcoming. Presumably this novel was intended to prepare readers for those future adventures. I would recommend that avid followers of the series read this book; first-time browsers should instead start with an earlier, worthier selection like THE TAR-AIYM KRANG."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Another Pip and Flinx novel. In Reunion Flinx is essentially grown up and is still searching for the reason for his existence (and understanding of his powers). He returns to Earth a using his powers befriends and tricks a woman so he can gain access to information about the Meliorare society who genetically enhanced him. Just as he is about to get the information he is looking for, it is stolen and he is forced to chase the thief across the galaxy. In the very surprising conclusion, a Tar Aim artifact is found as is Flinx's sister. Overall, I am getting pretty bored with Pip and Flinx. Come on Foster, throw us a bone here and let something actually happen. These books are turning into the X-Files, all hints at big things with no substance."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"Ok, I am a great Flinx and Commonwealth fan. I own all of the series, but I was disappointed with this book. I thought there was little character development, almost no expansion of our understanding of the commonwealth and a lot of contradictions from previous books, noteably the Tar-Aiym Krang. Without providing spoilers, I think this is a regertable effort in the commonwealth/Flinx universe."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews. This book while it does start true to the original Flix/Pip forumla nothing of real content is divalged. It is good for what it is but nothing comes of it.My impression-I liked this book, but like I said nothing really happened. You should read it if you are a big fan of this serise however."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to borrow the book from the library and buy it if it were a &quot;keeper&quot;. It is not. Usually after reading a book there are several secions I reread because they are so good. There were NO sections in Reunion I wanted to reread.I wondered why I was so disappointed and decided it was because:1. Flinx, in this book, is NOT a likable character. At the end, the book compares Flinx to his sister, Mahnahmi, with the intention of showing how much better Flinx is. However, at the beginning of the book he willingly destroys the career and psyche of an innocent, to get his own way. I'm fairly hard on people who cross their OWN moral boundaries but think it's OK so long as they feel bad about it momentarily. The only difference between Flinx and Mahnahmi is a matter of degree, she acknowledges what she is. He, feels bad, momentarily, but is willing to ruin people anyway. She is psychotic, he's obsessive and a hypocrite. Not a very appealing hero.2. About 20 - 22% of the book was excess verbiage, usually of 4 or 5 syllables. I think Mr. Foster has forgotten succinct, description creates a much better story. Especially in the desert I scanned 3 &amp; 4 paragraphs at a time, they added nothing to the book except length, and succeeded in making his near death boring enough for me to put the book down for several hours, before I went back to see how he lived through it.3. The premise that he is after information on the Meliorare Society to get rid of his headaches is pretty thin. They quote, created a lot of monsters who needed to be destroyed, so the members of the society obviously didn't know what they were going to get out of their slicing and dicing. Looking for a way to solve the headache problem would be a more logical premise.The book was at least good enough to finish reading, but had NO areas interesting enough to go back and read a second time. I'm glad I only borrowed it, otherwise I would have had to get rid of it."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"As big a fan of Alan Dean Foster that I am, I have yet to read any of the Pip (a mini-dragon) and Flinx books. I think I actually have at least one more of the series in a box somewhere, but have yet to read it because I wanted to get the whole series before I started. I would have been better off starting at the beginning.The story is quite good. I found myself zipping through the story from the beginning to the end. However, without the background of the previous books, I know I was missing a lot. Why was Flinx digging through computers on Earth? Why was his background unknown to him? I know, it was a big mistake to start a series with the last book, but many authors try to make their series books stand on their own enough that you lose little by not having read the previous books. Forget about that premise here. You need to read the previous books in the series to know what is going on. I did appreciate the references to stories I have read, such as \\"Cachalot\\" and \\"Midworld.\\" I enjoyed both novels and would recommend them.I did enjoy the ending of this novel (which was awesome and excellent, and made me want to read about the alien ship - which is one of the best features of this book), but it left a lot of questions unanswered. I also realized that the ending of the story is but a prelude to the next Pip and Flinx story because the chase is still on at the end of the book.For now my rating is three stars, but only because of the hanging ending. The story is well-written and fast-paced, but leaving the story for two years without a sequel seems like bad planning. I should point out that the next Pip and Flinx book, \\"Sliding Scales,\\" is expected to be out later this year. A well-written follow up to this book could easily change my rating to at least four stars and possibly five."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"The Flinx-novels are fun but the latest is very uninspired.There is nothing new to be learned about our hero.the whole action seems very coincidental.it reads like a first draft for a book.the ideas are not worked out and the writing is rather poor."},{"Title":"Reunion: A Pip and Flinx Novel","review":"This glimpse through a foggy window into the life of Flinx is classic Foster. In his inimitable fashion, Flinx gets into and out of trouble, using both his frustratingly uncooperative talent, and his trusty wits. Pip (a girl? Who knew?) is there with her characteristic desire for food and companionship. This novel wonderfully suplements the prior Flinx of the Commonwealth sequence, bringing back elements of earlier stories in a nice bit of a visit to memory lane. This would, however, present a bit of difficulty to those who are picking this up as their first Flinx selection: too many gaps in the overall epic are filled in from the reader's memory. The book stands alone wonderfully, but is much more satisfying as a continuation of a story that we've loved for years. Thanks, Mr. Foster. I'm waiting for the next one."},{"Title":"The Clean Air Act Handbook","review":"This book is a thorough and methodical survey of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, one of the most complicated and expansive pieces of environmental legislation ever enacted in the US, and is suitable for attorneys and non-lawyers alike. Chapters - each written by different experts in the field - cover a single program or sub-part of a program in considerable detail, discussing history, statutory framework, and regulatory development up to around 2005. Air professionals will benefit from the program-by-program approach, which lets them zero in on a topic of concern, and most of the chapters are lucent enough that a non-technical reader wouldn't get too lost. However, regulations and interpretations of the law change frequently, and I would caution against using this, or any one handbook, as your only authority."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"Were all the grammar and mechanical errors for real or part of the book. I love this guy's imagination and would gladly read more of his books. This isn't the same old crap. And it doesn't have anything to do with dope."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"If you really want your reviews to be taken seriously, you really need to learn how to spell and take a 'grammar' class at your local high school. Is there really anybody in the world that doesn't know how to spell the word 'Nazi' by now. I can understand one typo. I am constantly amazed at people who supposedly read books and are then unable to write four sentences without making without making an equal number of grammar and spelling errors. But the real problem is that(s)he manages to convey nothing of value to a potential reader. I am referring to the statements: \\"one of the best books I've ever read\\" followed by the unintelligible: \\"I don't exactly what the intent for the book was.\\" Does (s)he really believe these statements tell us anything about the book? But by far the most banal and embarrassingly incoherent statement was: \\"The story puts faith in the readers ability to understand our daily life and we do with it and don't do with it.\\" I recommend that the next time (s)he decides to 'inform' us about a book, he should stick with 'I liked it' or 'I hated it.' He should also start \\"Read with Dick and Jane.\\"I am surprised that no one has already made the joke/truth by informing: \\"I want more DOPE\\" that he (or she) definitely doesn't need any more."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"yeah, i never knew this book was going to turn out this way.forget the periods, eclmaaaaitions- and word check.What a mess,..... gee whiz batman, i think the point was missed.\\"i think so,\\" said Robin.I give my own book a rating of a 5.\\"Why?\\" asked Robin.\\"Because you don't know how to write.\\" Said BBatman.Yeah-RJE"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I love reading reviews of books I've read (I hardly review myself but I made an exeption in this case). All the people that gave this book a good review have only ever reviewed this book (despite being avid readers). Or if they reviewed any other book, like say Harry Potter, they somehow manage to write about \\"dope\\" and how great it is and how people should go read it. But they hardly write about the book they're supposed to be reviewing. Now it doesn't take a genious to figure out all these reviews are fake and written by either the author or his friends. And that's why I'm writing this review. I brought this book because it got great reviews only to find the book horrible and the reviews fake. This book doesn't go over anyones head. It's just a horrible book. DO NOT BUY THIS ATTEMP AT LITERATURE!"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I recently finished reading this \\"book\\" and am so glad that I never ever have to read it again. This book reads as if it were written by a mentally deficient community college dropout who flunked all his English, Writing, and Literature classes. Still, despite the obvious lack of talent, he persevered and wrote a lackluster, unoriginal and mind numbingly horrific book that may in fact be the worst book ever to be published. Don't let the good reviews sway you, they are obviously written by the author to try to get people to buy this disaster of a book. No one with a logical and stable thought process would actually like this dribble.Buy Dope only if you run out of toilet paper."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"Well don't be, this book kicks BUTT!!!!!I can say I've never really read a book like this before. I'm from New York and I'm really into wierd stories, I'm a big fan of anime because the japanese throw down stories without boundaries. But Dope takes the cake by far. The story is very complex and very simple all at once. You can glide through the work and laugh your BUTT off. Or, you can let every sentence and word hit you deep. The story goes deep into the philosophy of our daily lives. What we do with it, what affects us and what doesn't affect us. There's also a really awesome short story in the back called Novice, which is equally has intense. Novice is alot more serious than Dope. Dope plays off of the main character's (Frankl H.), whacky view of his surroundings. This is a must have...pick it up...BUY SOME DOPE!!!!!!"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I read this book in about a day. It's really complex. It layers out the story in a form of simplicity in a complicated way. The story is about Frankle Horowitz and his problem with As$#%oles. The problem with society in general. The story takes a stroll through complete lunacy and beyond. It's probably the best and most original book I've read in a long time. I usually don't write reviews, but I just had to do it with this book. It doesn't read as a book, it's more like thoughts that explain out life in general. Buy It,"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"What do you say about a book that talks about down syndrome kids, bars, the end of the world, oblivion, trains, systematic problems, reality, street fighting? I wouldn't even know where to begin. I will say this, Robert Escandon is a mastermind. His sarcastic take on human problems is only perfect next to creating his own genre of writing. The philosophy of theories was established here, throughout the pages of Dope. I highly recommend that anyone that can read get this book. It will forever change the way you look at books."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I true tale of madness and adventure. Set within a world satirically saturated with odd situations and disjointed opinions. I am an avid Vonnegut reader, and I quite enjoyed this view of a parallel universe polluted with day to day absurdity."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I didn't know this book was so popular.I'm almost half way done with the book, I have to say, the beginning is a little much. I had some trouble understanding if the story was real or completely made up. But once I hit the end of chapter 2, it all started to come together. The story is whacked out. There's a part where the characters visit Oblivion for a vacation, man...too much, but it's really fun to read. If you like having your mind spinning open, read the book, and hail to Mr. EscanDOPE for his madness."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"My hat goes off to Robert J. Escandon. This book is seriously amazing. I just finished reading it and decided to post a review on it. The book starts off with a bang caused by the birth of Frankl, after that it strings along philosophy, theories of existence and bold humor. It's accompanied by a short story called Novice that's as amazing as Dope."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"Let me tell you, I heard about this book a while back when the writer was pitching it around. I thought it was one of those type of books, but it's not. This is book is simply amazing, I bought it recently, and have not been able to put it down. If you like Fight Club, Breakfast of Champions and things of that nature, you'll love Dope."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I've read many books that have to do with really crazy theories. \\"Nothing in this book is true...\\" BY Frissel is a good one and some of Vonnegut, but this book is simply mad. I came across it through a band I know called Stoma, the singer wrote the book and pushed it on me, man was he right to do that. When I started reading it, I felt attached to the piece instantly. I'm not done reading it yet,, but I just had to come here and express how good the book is. It deals with alot of the perspective of an alcoholic and troubles with people in general. Good read!"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"This book is a laugh. I read it in about a day and a half. I couldn't put it down. I started to read it and the opening caught me right off the bat. As Frankl explains the process of his birth, the story takes an upward spiral into random scenarios that make up the whole picture. This story is an exercise into the reality that we pave and how we morph it and how it morphs us. I had a bit of a problem with the lead characters use of the word \\"retard\\", but Frankl is a jerk, and I love it. BUY DOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"Dope is a really screwed up book.At the surface, it's a happy little ride about an alcoholic, and his delusions. A little deeper than that, the book is about the philosophy of reality. I bought it online from MasterFlowproductions.com, which you guys should check out if you like the book. Simply the book relates to the different realities that we all have and randomly share with one another. This is among my favorite books of all time, if you like philosophy mixed in with comedic madness, check it out."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I loved this book. I've read it twice already and I'm still finding stuff in it that makes my head spin. I was a little like what the hell did I just buy? But mid way through the first page I was too far in to know what hit me. And what hit me was pure brilliance. The story of Frankl is one that is as head turning as the book cover is. It's mysterious and the author writes in riddles. And it is by far not easy to ignore. Sometimes I would be reading and just start thinking of a phrase or topic that I read about a couple of chapters ago. And I would go back re-read those chapters again and again. This is one of those sleeper hits. Definitely not everyone. But for those with more than half a brain, this book is for you."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"It's suprising how any one has anything bad to say about this book. I suppose it goes to show you that some concepts go too deep for people. And they're just mad because they're stuck in what they think a book should be or what a book should be about. I for one have read all sorts of books. From Charles Dickes to Ayn Rand, George Ritchie Jr to comics and more. And I must say, that Dope, is a conceptual piece of work. The story of Dope is not for those who are stuck on detail, because there is no way that anyone can keep up with a story like this by trying to retain details. It's Hypnotic, there is no way to do it. The supposed grammar mistakes are obviously purposely done. Robert J. Escandon's work is done in this style as a form of philosophy. To be caught up in one detail is to miss the big picture. And that is what Dope is compeltely about. The book is awesome. I still recommend it to anyone that likes to be challenged and loves good stories. Dope is the way to go. Close to the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"What a masterpiece man, I can't believe it. I'm not much of a reader, I got an e-mail telling me to BUY DOPE!!!! hahaha......And I took a chance bought it on Amazon and boy is it good.

The author does not know how to write cohesively or progress plot. It is also evident from the juvenile spelling and grammar errors that there was no editor desperate enough to waste their time nor risk their reputation correcting the author's mistakes. If an author doesn't want to put in the effort needed to write a book, why would you put in the effort to read his work?"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"After reading the naseau inducing prose, and quickly realizing that there was no way I could have just spent 15 bucks on this garbage.

I can't that there was a moment where I was bored. There was an issue about the character already being developed at the very beginning of the story. Which is odd because most books allow you to see the development. But, not in Dope. The characters start off and end in the same manner. But that doesn't mean the book is not good. The book is probably the best absurd story I've ever read. I loved it. It's an odd taste and definitely not for everyone. Especially people that can't get past certain traditional writings. Every rule is meant to be broken, and Dope breaks them all. Pick up Dope and read it for what it is....an absurd adventure that leaves you in such a deep sense of inner thought, that you just can't stop thinking about it. It's DOPE!!!! BUY IT!!!!"},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"Not that I consider myself a grammar nazi (for if I was I wouldn't be making such terrible grammar mistakes), or someone who enjoys a good book or rather someone who knows the difference between a good book and a bad book, but I for one do not believe in Dope. I can't see how a human being can say that this very adorable attempt to an undeveloped idea can stand against the works of Salinger, Thompson and others.Mr. Escandon's childish expression to deliver his frustration of the world is as cute as a kindergardener coloring outside the lines, or writing his/her name with a crayon and getting all the letters wrong.Can't say I recommend this thing."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I bought this book last night.WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm only on chapter 4, but i can't put this book down.Dope is the best book I've read this far, funny, playful and very very deep.

It doesn't read like book, more like a movie. It's a quick 120 some pages with enough material to make your head spin to the edge of the universe. AWESOME AWESOME....It's along the lines of The Rum Diaries by Hunter and a splash of Breakfast of Champions by Vonnegut. Really good read, the author nailed his own genre in this work, something hard to do but done in DOPE."},{"Title":"DOPE","review":"I just finished reading the book. By far one of the best books I've ever read. I don't exactly what the intent for the book was, but I will tell you that it goes everywhere and back within 100 ir so pages. I would have to say that anyone that's into philosophy or wants a really interesting read should pick this bad boy up A-SAP.Okay, for starters the book reveals a very intimate side of what our reality is and could be. The story puts faith in the readers ability to understand our daily life and we do with it and don't do with it. Frankl is by far one of the most inventive and crazy characters I've ever met. His obsession with the Naza Chambers are very near insanity and his obsessions to alcohol dismantle his reality.

The book sucks!!!!Just kidding, I read the book about a month ago and decided to come here to throw it down. The book, Dope, is really good. It's really funny, because the book has alot of character. But again, it's not for everyone. The funniest part about it, is that the book is an art piece written to keep those readers that think they can read, away. So I see that it's doing it's job. The book is about life and all that stuff. But it's one of the best reads till this point. And for the record i don't know the author, and probably will never meet him. Anyone that writes this type of book, has issues, but in a good way. Dope is legendary and if you like your mind twisted and questioned, buy it.

I got on here and saw the reviews and laughed my butt ago.DOPE IS WRITTEN POORLY!!!!!Not really. Even though many of these 0 stars said this, the book went over their so called heads. Dope constantly makes fun of itself as a badly written story. It constantly makes fun of the writer himself for not being able to write the lead characters story well. It is a piece that is conscience of itself. Hard to believe that there is Bravery left in literature still today. The book is NOT A NORMAL BOOK. And when someone puts something like this out, it's an open target for people to poke at it. Whether some like it or hate it, DOPE causes a big wave among people. It has lovers and haters. I for one like the book because it's a book written for the non-reader. Anyone that knows anything about DOPE and the company that it derives from should know that all MasterFlow projects are done in a manner outside of the box. So if you picked up Dope thinking it was a normal book, you thought wrong. This story takes you out of a normal setting and into the setting which the lead character, Frankl lives in, a DISTORTED VIEW OF A REALITY THAT ONLY EXISTS IN HIS EYES. Not the authors and especially not the reader. So if you don't like the book, it's because you don't like the world that it's set in. And I'm sure there will still be people to curse this review out, because it went over their heads just like DOPE.I'm giving the work the PROPS it deserves.I usually don't write reviews, but just like everyone else, I came here because the book stirred something in me, like it did with everyone else that has written on this page. BECAUSE EVEN THOSE WHO CAME HERE HATING CAME HERE WITH ONLY ONE REVIEW ON THEIR REVIEW HISTORY!!!!

As startling as it may sound, this book is not real, and neither was Bill Kaysing, for that manner. Don't believe me? I've created this list of 25 undebunkable facts that seal the prove once and for this book's nonexistence.1. If this book had actually been printed, the printing press would have generated so much heat it would have set fire to the floor beneath it.2. It is physically impossible to slice an entire tree into paper-thin sheets.3. Bill Kaysing wrote more than 20 books, but was so poor at the end of his life he was living in a trailer park.4. Mr. Kaysing wrote books on living off the land and surviving on 99 cents a day, but somehow still managed to die.5. If you opened this book exactly in the middle, it would break in half.6. The cover would have to be six feet thick to protect to prevent damaging sunlight from burning off the words contained inside.7. A UPS truck cannot hold enough fuel to deliver it from one side of the US to the other.8. This book was self-published, meaning Mr. Kaysing would have died from inhaling fumes from the glue used in the binding.9. No one had test-published a book with an actual human author about the moon landing hoax before. How could it worked the first time?10. If you bake this book in a radioactive oven, it turns into a book about how the moon landings were real.11. The computing power available in 1976 was insufficient to compensate for the book's changing center-of-gravity as it was read from cover to cover.12. There are no customer images of this book on this site.13. If you throw this book into the wind, it doesn't follow a perfect parabolic arc like it should.14. American books were catching on fire when the Russians were sending books into space every week.15. This book has no flexible joints in it. My hands became tired after 10 minutes of holding it.

It may not provide actual, physical proof, but it does provide enough evidence or probable cause for fraud, for which we, American taxpayers, paid. We've been deceived and swindled.I worked at a museum for a spell on a project funded by NASA. The goal was to get people excited about NASA, of course. They have to justify that exorbitant budget somehow. All those involved in this project needed to find ways to get people interested in space science. I suggested that maybe we should come up with a list of all the science we've learned that we could never have known if we hadn't gone to the moon or even to space. No one could come up with one single item for this list. Fact is, we haven't learned anything that we didn't learn here on Earth. The few innovative ideas or items people did come up with were produced here on Earth, for space travel, if we were to go. But overall, I do believe it's mostly because we really hadn't gone anywhere beyond the space station. And what is the space station? A billion dollar room with a view. We're such idiots to allow this to continue.Fact is, they know that if people could believe this, they can believe all sorts of massive hoaxes like, say, 9/11, and that the warming of the Earth is man made, and that Kennedy was killed by some lone whacko, the holocaust, and so on. Fact is, the same players, are behind all of these hoaxes."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"I received the book quickly. Upon opening the package I was a little disappointed in the overall size and content of it. The book has good information in it, but it seemed scattered and in no particular order at all. Sometimes it was a little hard to make sense of. I did read the whole thing in one night, and have to say it does open your eyes to the fact they could have staged the whole thing right in Nevada. Good book, but needed to be more organized and written, and less like a note pad."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"When it comes to the Apollo moon landings, Americans are generally convinced that they actually took place, no questions asked. The author of this book does raise valid questions about Apollo. He worked in the program and reveals critical shortcomings, that raise serious questions as to their real capabilities at the time. What makes me agree with the author's doubts about Apollo however, is how they shut it all down and reverted back to orbital missions with the shuttle program. I mean if we really knew how to go to the moon why are we wasting our time just endlessly circling the earth? It's as though Apollo never happened. The disconnect is too profound to be overlooked as they clearly have no expertise or capability to do moon mission whatsoever. The NASA manned space timeline is completely out of whack. We went from projects mercury, gemini, apollo, and back to a glorified project gemini, in the shuttle missions. This doesn't add up! We've either mastered lunar flights or we haven't. Since its obvious NASA couldn't do a moon mission today, or even in five years, to save its life, I'm going with the Apollo was a hoax idea, because that's the best explanation for this strange state of affairs."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"Do your own research, dates, names countries etc, etc. if you read the reviews you can understand some of the reviews given only one or two stars.... people that have no understanding of anything but believing that america is the center of the universe.

Since the public is not known for it's intelligence or it's ability to detect government hoaxes and scams, I had to give Mr. Kaysing's book a serious look. He states his case much better than I expected. The book challenges everything we've been told about NASA and Apollo based upon Kaysing's view from inside the early Apollo project. Kaysing shows that NASA's pristine image is like so much else in this world, mostly hype. Anyone with the gumption to take on NASA, and it's legions of syncophants in TV-land, can't be all bad! The views of Mr. Kaysing based upon the information he's presents here, is essentially more in line with the true nature of our government and agencies like NASA, than what John Q.

I had heard bits n' pieces, rumors about a simulation of this historic date in our TimeLine and basically brushed aside the notion of any fakery involved.I ordered the book, &quot;We Never.....&quot; and then my mind started to see what my eyes refused to. The points that I think make this event suspicious to me now are the 6 near perfect &quot;trips&quot; to the Moon; the astronauts entering the unfilterd sunlight areas, temperatures that their suits would not allow them to survive; deaths of people involved with the 'mission' that perhaps were a threat to the success of the secret. If it wasn't faked, then the Government would have all the information at it fingertips to disprove the theory and put the disbelievers to rest........??

He then lays down some stunningly incisive observations with oodles of documentation to back everything up... oops, my mistake. Silly Dipper. I know Deputy Ding-A-Ling is wrong because Ol' Dipper was there when Apollo IX landed on de' Moon (I am The Man in the Moon). My buddy Herman Martian (Marvin's younger half-brother) guided them down with his Proto-Blaster light paddles and the Lunar Lander landed square on my big belly. That is why no crater was left when it touched down (plus it only weighed one-sixth in the Moon's gravity and I lo-o-o-ove brontoburgers!). Neil and I then split a six-pack of Lunar Lager together to celebrate at Tranquility Base and knocked a few golf balls around (Neil shanked a few). It was then picture time, but those pesky bright, bright, brite stars kept ruining the shots so, Scotty beamed me down a size XXXXXXXXL-Tall black T-shirt. I put it on and then blocked out the sky with my width for Neil and his buddy while Herman snapped away with the Polaroid.

I mourn the loss of the time I spent reading this.... thing. I will not even call this rambling snarl of images and text a book. That this man could shame the Apollo astronauts who went to the moon, the astronauts who gave their lives in the quest to get there, and the hundreds of thousands of Americans involved in sending us to the moon, is appalling.To speak about the pseudo-scientific \\"evidence\\" that he presents is a waste of time. However, if this person's ideas have intrigued you, I will briefly refute three of the most popular ideas:1) The flag is waving. We faked the Apollo program and shot it on a stage in Nevada.The flag was stiffened with wire on the back to give it the apperance of waving, since there is no air on the Moon. Plans to do this can even be found in books written before we went to the Moon! Movies where the flag is actually waving only appear where the Apollo astronauts were struggling to stick the flag in the soil, and as a result, the thin wires vibrated.2) There is no blast crater underneath the lunar module. We faked the Apollo program and shot it on a stage in Nevada.There is no blast crater underneath the lunar module because, as can be found in countless books and websites, the lunar module's engine was shut down about five feet above the lunar surface. A long probe extended from the end of each footpad. When they touched the ground, the engine was shut down to prevent thrust from bouncing back from the surface and damaging the LM.3) There are no stars in the pictures from the moon. We faked the Apollo program and shot it on a stage in Nevada.'Have you ever tried to take a picture of a bright object and a dim one at the same time? The lunar cameras were designed to take pictures of the well-lit surface. The bright lunar surface and Earth washed out the stars. If you don't believe this, try to find stars on a moonlit night with snow cover or try to take a picture of a flashlight and a car headlight at the same time.My favorite part of this book is when he says that while the astronauts were not on the Moon but in Las Vegas, they were visiting bars and the like. There is a full-page spread of an exotic dancer. No astronauts, just a dancer. Boy, I'm really convinced now!Please, don't, don't, DON'T get this book. There are better things to do with your life, like planting hyacinths, re-inventing the law of gravity, or painting pictures of your relatives."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"The gist of Kaysing's pamphlet (as near I can make out - the writing style is not exactly fluid) is that NASA was under enormous pressure to produce a successful moon-shot before the Soviets. What Kaysing didn't know (no doubt due to his complete and utter lack of research) is that the Soviet moon program was dead and buried long before 1969 - and pretty much everyone at NASA and the CIA already knew that.The Saturn V rocket was powered by a 1st stage module which consisted of 5 J-2 engines. (If you've ever been to KSC, you'll know how big these engines are. You could, quite literally, park a car inside a J-2 engine.) The Soviets, in their haste, made a crucial design error in their moon-rocket - the N1 (technically, the N1-L3). They built the first stage with 30 NK-33 engines (yup - that's *thirty* engines). They then discovered what the Americans already knew - controlling the thrust of multiple engines was difficult, but without even thrust from all engines, the rocket would be unstable, and would never fly. NASA had enough trouble working out a control system for 5 engines - the Soviets never had a chance of controlling thirty engines simultaneously. The technology to do so simply did not exist. The N1 program suffered a series of catastrophic failures during the mid to late 60's.About a month before the Apollo 11 launch, seismic detectors all over Europe picked up a massive detonation originating in Russia. CIA spy planes later imaged the Baikonur launch complex, only to discover that the complex was almost completely destroyed.Decades later, the Soviets admitted what the CIA already knew - the N1 had exploded on the launch pad, with massive loss of life. The Baikonur plant had to be abandoned - along with the N1 program.NASA had all the time in the world to get the Apollo program safely off the ground - there was no longer any pressure to take shortcuts. The moon race was over long before Apollo 11 lifted off from KSC, and took its crew safely to the Moon."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"When I realised I'd dropped $15 for this I could have wept. I want to believe in conspiracy theories however books like this do not help the cause.It's a thin tome to begin with; in addition, a number of the pages are taken up entirely with (often irrelevant) photographs, looking as it they've been taken on some ancient old busted camera and photocopied a dozen times.This is an interesting topic however this book in no way does it justice. Purchase something else for your money."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"This book is the original source of the Moon Hoax theory. It is interesting that this single volume created a moon hoax industry. Kaysing himself does not seem to have made much money from this venture, but I'm not sure that the same can be said about the next generation espousing his views. I purchased this publication for historical purposes only.The production values in this book are very low. Obviously self-published as no reputable publisher would print a text of such poor quality. The photos used show generational degeneration and seem to be 1970s photocopies of 4th generation prints. The writing style is inconsistent and chaotic to be charitable. The format changes several times during the course of this thin tome.His proofs are predominantly mere assertions. He fails to back them up in any way shape or form. Sometimes Kaysing supplies untested hearsay, but most of the time we don't even have that.As a physicist (M.Sc. Physics and studying for a Ph.D. in Engineering) I have tested his claims of the faked launches. Unfortunately this is made harder as Kaysing seems to have no grasp of basic physics or engineering. Also many of his facts and claims are at direct odds to what I have been able to observe directly myself in my own research, experiments and life experience. I must admit that I have been unable to replicate any of the claims that Kaysing makes.I would recommend this book for historical purposes only as a case study in how many of the general public will believe anything that is published, even if there is no actual evidence supplied."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"First, the presentation of the &quot;book&quot; (more like a pamphlet) doesn't do much for credibility. Looks like a publication from a lunatic fringe type group with limited funds. The &quot;pictures&quot; are a joke. He repeatedly asks &quot;where are the STARS in this picture&quot;. With the poor quality, you can't even make out the astronauts fingers in some of the pictures.Second, after &quot;reading&quot; through half of this rambling, uncoordinated series of disconnected questions, musings, and innuendos, it's pretty clear the author should not be taken seriously. I can't prove wether we went to the moon or not, just as Bill Kaysing can't prove we didn't. And if we didn't why haven't the Russians denounced the feat, and why haven't all those US citizens involved finally come forward (now that the USSR is kaput and there's no reason to maintain that superior position in space). Indeed, we are now partnering with the Russians on the ISS.Finally, the author builds no case for his hoax premise. There is no attempt to build a cause and effect type analysis, which would lead to questions and/or conclusions that would (if not conclusively answered or proven) suport his hypothesis. In other words, this is far from a scientific treatise.Save your money and don't get swindled by Bill Kaysing and his ramblings like I did."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"Bill Kaysing is the grandmaster of the moon hoax game. For the uninitiated, Kaysing and a happy band of \\"investigative journalists\\" believe that NASA faked all of the moon missions for one reason or another.Ironically, this book began as a satire of the moon hoax theory. Kaysing was contracted to write an outlandish tome that would make fun of the theory, showing how ridiculous it is. But, the story goes, as he researched his quarry, he became convinced that NASA had indeed defrauded everybody and that the astronauts never got farther from earth than an airplane.I won't go into Kaysing's \\"proof\\" of all this, because there is none. His creativity, however, can be amusing. Kaysing writes that while we thought we were watching moon walkers bound along the moon's surface 250,000 miles from earth, they were actually getting down in Las Vegas girlie bars. His evidence? He has a full-page spread of an exotic dancer. Of course, we don't see any astronauts, but the dancer sure is nice to look at.Then there are the personal schedules. Kaysing gives us what he believes were the astronauts' activities on earth during the moon flights. One of my favorites is the \\"Guilt Therapy\\" sessions, obviously for whomever was suffering pangs from defrauding us all. Did these schedules come on official NASA letterhead? Were they developed by government officials? No, they came straight from Kaysing's imagination--but what the heck.Bill gets ugly with his original editor. He reprints a letter from the woman where she tells him that his manuscript just isn't written very well, and therefore she cannot publish it. I guess Bill never received a rejection letter before, because he concludes that this is proof she is in cahoots with NASA to suppress his efforts to expose the truth.It's tempting to say that this is so bad that it's good, but I can't, because there are people who actually believe this moon hoax garbage, and revere Kaysing for starting the whole thing. What is most annoying is the attitude of these folks. Their ignorance of basic logic, critical thinking and scientific concepts is outweighed only by their arrogance: they do not put forth their ideas as mere theory, but as fact. And when challenged, they respond with \\"NASA made that up,\\" or \\"that cannot be proven,\\" \\"the photos were faked\\" or \\"how do you know--were you there?\\" All the while, forgetting that they have never furnished one bit of creditable evidence. All they do is make up claims, and then put them forth as fact. (Kaysing once said that he knew a geologist who said the moon rocks actually came from earth. His friend's name? Credentials? Proof? Funny--that's not in the interview.)This book was once the subject of an article in the Weekly World News--you know, the paper that features articles such as \\"Clinton catches Hillary in bed with space alien!\\" Kaysing applauded the News for their work on his behalf. Enough said."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"Wow this is a bad book. Terrible writing and organization, not to mention he is completely wrong. Buy the book 'Bad Astronomy' instead if you want to learn about the moon landing and hoax theories."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"How could someone in their right mind think that the Apollo moon landings were staged in a top-secret sound studio in Nevada? Jim Lovell, an astronaut who traveled to the moon in 1968 and 1970, was right on the money when he called this godforsaken author a &quot;kook.&quot; And I also back him on his assertion that mankind's reach for the moon was expensive and took the energies and resources of thousands of people, and it's something that everyone should be proud of. Nothing has come close to convince me the six lunar landings were a hoax, and this book's pathetic theory hasn't changed my tune, either. &quot;There were no stars in the photographs, so it couldn't have been taken on the moon,&quot; he says. Apparantly he doesn't understand that the sun blocks out the light of the stars in lunar pictures. And he also claims that the astronauts who have walked there are quiet when he talks to them, so they have something to hide. Or maybe they know an insane, offensive person when they see one. He also insists that the technology required to reach the moon wasn't there in the late sixties and early seventies, nor does it exist today. There, we can conclude that he doesn't know about the U.S. Mercury and Gemini programs. The astronauts of those missions stayed in space for up to two weeks , docked and rendezvoused with other spacecraft, and performed spacewalks, paving the way for lunar flights and proving most of the objectives needed to require them. And unmanned Surveyor spacecraft had landed on the moon concurrent with Gemini, something he probably doesn't know about either. Somehow, I don't think NASA would fake a lunar landing with the knowledge that it could successfully perform a real one from past manned and unmanned flights."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"The naivete of the arguments presented in this book is truly astounding. Even if one is inclined to believe the more convoluted of the \\"proofs\\" (which have long since been debunked by people who - unlike Kaysing - ARE experts in their fields), many others are easily refuted by a 9-year-old with a passing interest in space flight. For example, the \\"flapping flag\\" proof still gives me a belly laugh. Kaysing apparently doesn't understand that the flag was wired to appear as though it waved in the absense of a lunar atmosphere! Of course, the moon rocks and soil have been studied around the world and are universally accepted as authentic. Interestingly, several astronauts (Gordon Cooper, Scott Carpenter, et al.) have an axe to grind with NASA and yet have never suggested the moon landings were faked (they fear being shot by CIA agents, no doubt). Most of all the Soviets would have been the first to call America's bluff. But no, they kept quiet too. SO, this is an INTERNATIONAL conspiracy involving not only the 100,000+ people involved in Apollo from NASA down to the worker on the assembly lines at Grumman and North American (Apollo contractors) AND the international geological community AND the Soviet Union.

The point I would like to make (not that the sheep will listen anyway) is that at least this man had the courage to make his accusations knowing the vicious, cowardly attacks that would naturally follow. Why cowardly? What do you call someone who joins the mob to throw stones at a lone man who has taken courage in his convictions and started, what they call in a free society, a debate. Naturally if his conclusions are true they would be supressed, turned down by all the major publishers and only see the light of day thanks to smaller, 'amateurish' printers. If what he proposes is true, the 'lunar hoax' would have the might of the entire federal government as well as main stream media to guard and maintain it's secrecy. Why was it so important to reach the moon when we supposedly did? How did we beat the Soviets there when they were so far ahead of us in space technology (Sputnik? Yuri Gagarin?) Why didn't the Soviets ever go ahead with their own moon landing? Why hasn't any other country? Why have we never returned to the moon in 35 years? What did we gain that was worth spending so many billions of dollars in the midst of hyper-inflation? Why have so many pertinent NASA documents gone 'missing' when requested for research? Something is rotten here and even if the author isn't 100% correct in his theories at least he got the ball rolling.

The only problem I had with Kaysing's book was how his chapters were organized. This book is in serious need of an editor! The photographs in the book were very interesting, but they really need to be printed on glossy paper or something so their details can be made out better.

During the 1960's, our computers were almost as big as rooms - even in 1970, college students who majored in computer science had to access one main campus computer using a stack of punch cards in exact order!! Tell me that we had the technology to do all the work for the elaborate moon missions when it took NASA over 2 years to correct the O-ring malfunction that caused the explosion of a shuttle. Now if it takes that long to fix an O-ring, how could NASA have perfected the lunar landing module in 3 months. That's the time frame from the Fox program's great file footage of an uncontrollable lunar lander to the launch time of the 1st moon mission. Furthermore,if we had mastered the science of protecting humans from the extreme radiation of the Van Allen belt, why haven't we touted that achievement? And why did our nation not volunteer to give that technology to the USSR when Chernobyl melted down? Actually, the reason we can't fake it to the moon these days is that our communications/satellite tracking would expose the trickery. Finally, thousands of people worked on bits and pieces of the NASA moon project, but how many of those people actually saw the whole thing come together? Our nation was preoccupied with the bloody Vietnam War at the time and still in mourning for JFK. He promised to have a man on the moon by the end of the 60's, and (wouldn't you know) we did it.

People can't be blamed for getting peeved by ideas that shake the foundations of cherished and widely held beliefs. On the other hand, the world of men is driven by what people believe to be \\"true\\", not what's actually true. Truth is often stranger than fiction; so it essentially boils down to whether we wish to really know the truth about things or not? While most people think conventional wisdom is obvious and indisputable, others are not afraid to have their concept of things completely upset, seeking the truth wherever it leads them, and letting the chips fall where they may. This book is obviously written for the latter type of person. The author makes a convincing case against Apollo by covering various facts from his employment with one of the leading Apollo contractors, and gleaned from his familiarity with the workings of the space program at that time.At the end of the day however, the most powerful evidence that Apollo was a hoax is the fact that today, NASA is technically unable to send men to the moon! This amazing fact is not from lack of money or public interest, but from plain old ignorance! They just don't know how to do this! This is equivalent to Boeing suddenly being unable to build a jet aircraft, after successfully building and flying them for several years! Science just doesn't go backwards like this, nor does it completely abandon successful systems, without producing innovations based upon them! How is it that the usual evolutionary progression of knowledge and skill present in every known scientific breakthrough is somehow absent in our post Apollo space program? If the expertise garnered in the Apollo program over thirty years ago was genuine, why are we not now leveraging it into more sophisticated trans-lunar vehicles and flights? Why after Apollo has our space program suffered such a catastrophic loss of expertise? How do you justify a timeline that takes us from the cutting edge lunar flights of Apollo to Shuttle missions, limited to techniques first perfected during the Gemini program? Certainly the Shuttle is an advance in re-usable space transport, but technologically it's inferior to Apollo in one significant respect: it's incapable of operating outside of relatively low earth orbit! Why the technological regression in manned space flight?No scientific organization has ever voluntarily dumbed itself down like NASA has, since Apollo! Successful lunar missions confirm the solution of monumental scientific and engineering problems! Preserving such invaluable expertise is fundamental to all scientific organizations! There's absolutely no valid reason for NASA's current incompetence, except that perhaps the spectacular achievements and breakthroughs of Apollo never really took place! If they had, it's safe to say, that manned moon missions would be easier to pull-off today, and still part of the NASA repertoire. They're not, and are still questionable for the forseeable future! The profound disconnect between Apollo and current NASA activities, is the most convincing indication that what was done during Apollo, was not genuine."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"So I guess there are actually 4 kinds of people: Those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, those who wonder what happened, and those who say it didn't happen.

I found it confusing and not very well presented as science, but as an attempt to convince not prove. Mr. Kaysing did not hit the nail on the head. The most credible part may have been that the ground underneath the space vehicle was undisturbed, not showing evidence that it had landed, but was placed there. His notion was that the vehicle would have made more of an impression in the soil at the landing site.

But despite a seven year stint at Rocketdyne, the firm that built the main propulsion units for Apollo, I could not work up the least interest in the entire astrophysical circus... I decided I did not believe that Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin or anyone else was going to the moon. And consequently, I could not generate the least enthusism for watching a phony performance.\\" (Pg. 7)He continues, \\"As the years passed, I found myself comparing the Apollo flights to many other incidents in American life. Watergate was an outstanding example... The energy 'crisis' was another Apollo simulation... Now was the time to ask some questions of NASA... like, why didn't the astronauts make some visible signal from the moon?... Why is it that NASA's Apollo records are not classified, but are also not available to the general public?... Why did so many astronauts end up as executives of large corporations? Was this their real reward for the moon 'trip'?... Eight astronauts died in non-space accidents: were they all accidents?... What proof do we have that they are actually rocks from the moon?\\" (Pg. 7-8)He admits that the launches were real (\\"After all, if people could drive to the Cape, park and see an immense rocket lift itself off the pad, was this not the ultimate proof that a trip was, indeed, being made to the moon itself?\\"; pg. 63). He summarizes, \\"as astropolitics, as a justification for great expenditures, and finally, as a military venture, the Apollo project looms as a most formidable entity. It is understandable why... to this day, there is virtually nothing available to dispute the hoax. Nothing, that is, until this book was written.\\" (Pg. 72)He also notes that after writing the book in 1974, a short paragraph was included in the Zodiac News Service in San Francisco, after which \\"I did a total of 52 live and taped shows, including one on 'Tomorrow' with Tom Snyder.\\" (Pg. 74)The book is long on speculative questions, and short on genuine evidence.

Don't take it seriously, though - it's just too silly!"},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"This is perhaps the most poorly organized book I've ever read, (and reads more like a *very* rough draft). That said, Kaysing was a brave man to publish his hunch and then challenge Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin to a live televised debate. Aldrin initially accepted but as showtime approached he declined.Kaysing makes two good points (mixed in with irrelevancies and errors):1. Kaysing was a NASA technical editor participating in documentation of the descent stage rocketry used to permit the Apollo lunar module to touch down safely on the lunar surface. Based on his knowledge of the rocketry's performance characteristics and thrust, Kaysing claims that it would have left a huge crater beneath the lunar module on touchdown. No such crater is ever visible in any Apollo photo.2. In films from the moon, we never see the astronauts emerging from the lunar module (LEM). Kaysing asserts that the door of the LEM is too small to permit an astronaut wearing the bulky Apollo spacesuit to enter or leave. This is curious if you happen to visit the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Buzz Aldrin's Apollo spacesuit and an Apollo lunar module are on display. Kaysing appears right - that door seems snug. Additionally, the space-suited Apollo mannikins descending the ladder of the LEM are midget-sized (the space suits themselves are under five feet tall). And, oddly, nearly all the spacesuits on display around the LEM are under five feet tall.Curiously, UK physicist Dr David Groves et alia have discovered serious anomalies in the Apollo pictures that indicate (at least some of) those pictures could not possibly have been taken on the Moon. That is, Kaysing's lunar hoax hunch is now being scientifically supported - to some degree - by digital image analysis.Kaysing's premise mirrors that of the 1978 film Capricorn One - that the Apollo program started off in good faith but found itself unable to \\"make it\\" so it \\"faked it\\", with US government complicity, because the ultimate goal was the militarization of space.The lunar hoax discussion is fascinating (albeit moot) for several reasons:1. As with some other urban legends, there are just enough oddities to give you pause.2. Five hundred years ago the Ptolemaic view of the solar system was accepted by everyone, although science indicated something was amiss. (In good science, if there is even one exception to your theory then your theory is disproven.) We now see the curious spectacle of Apollo proponents arguing from faith while Apollo critics argue from facts. While facts are notoriously impartial things, they are appearing to side - to some degree - with the critics.3. The whole discussion has emotional valences clouding the issue because we are dealing with a modern myth (true or not): \\"We landed on the moon\\". To accept that the US may have carried out an elaborate hoax to justify funding for the militarization of space requires a paradigm shift, much like David Ray Griffin argues regarding mass acceptance of the official account of the events of 911, (which account also hasn't successfully persuaded everyone).Kaysing's book-pastiche is of value primarily as the seminal work on this topic."},{"Title":"We never went to the moon","review":"We never went.

I very much wanted to know more, and to hear her sing when her voice was a little fresher, and, like another reviewer here, didn't really know where to start. This book has been a godsend for me.The text covers Callas' life and career, and includes many photos and a discography. This book includes two CD's with arias from most of the roles Callas sang on stage and a number of ones she didn't.The text that accompanies each aria discusses when and how it was recorded, its place in Callas' career, and the real treasure for me is that it discusses, with notations of exact timings so that one can listen to each example, the nuances of drama, emotion and technique that characterize phrases, words, sometimes single notes. It is a fascinating way to get to know the work of a most remarkable artist. I have to say that I was blown away by the Mad Scene from Lucia di Lammermour and the lovely &quot;La mamma morta&quot; from Andrea Chenier, both recorded in 1955, when her voice was fresher than in my later Norma.Because of the discussion about the painstaking and creative way that Callas crafted her interpretations of the roles she sang, I have a new appreciation for her singing, and I think I finally begin to understand what was so special and moving about her art.I recommend this book to people well-acquainted with Callas' work as well as neophytes like myself.

I've been wanting to know more about Callas for some time but am always daunted when I go into a record store and see the row upon row of recordings. Where do you start? I suppose the best introduction would be to sit down with someone who knew a lot about her, who would tell you her story, while playing selections of some of her greatest recordings and pointing out what to listen for, relish, and occasionally criticise in each performance. However, in the absence of such a friend Robert Levine will do very nicely. The book is beautifully produced and the pictures of Callas at every stage of her career are stunning. The real joy though are the two CDs and the accompanying commentary in the book. Each aria is set in context and there are (thank goodness) librettos and timings.

The biography of Ms. Callas is short and highly readable, covers the most important aspects of her life, and offers much insight into her personality and the important role it played in her rise and decline. One comes away with the feeling that this is a balanced study, not without some human sympathy but not partisan or tendentious either. Levine mainly lets the evidence speak for itself, which is about as much as anyone can do in a work of this length. Unfortunately, as others have noted, the editing is sloppy and leaves much to be desired. Some sentences are just incoherent or incomplete. The word \\"ignored\\" appears as \\"gnored\\" in one place. In a discussion of Callas' 1965 return to the Met, we are told that Robert, Edward, and Jacqueline Kennedy were in the audience the first night. Later in the book, Edward is omitted and John Kennedy is said to have been there, even though he had obviously been dead for 2 years by that time. One hopes the book may be revised one day to permit the correction of such egregious errors.The real treasures of this volume are the photos, of which there are many, and the 2 CD's with almost 3 hours of music, coupled with Levine's valuable and fascinating commentary. For anyone looking to understand the uniqueness and power of Maria Callas' singing, Levine has performed a major service. He provides enough background about the opera and the aria being sung that one can understand Ms. Callas' motivation and approach. He also points to particular passages by the timings where they occur in order to explain what she is doing at that point and why it makes sense, dramatically.

I have a new appreciation of the French composers (Gounod, Saint Sans, Massenet) thanks to these CDs. The first two chapters (about 2/3s of the book) are worthless as they provide no new information and appear to be copy/pasted from extant biographies. The last and third chapter is a good idea not fully developed. It provides a guide on listening to the arias which may be useful to the untrained ear.

Sometimes the two have embraced each other with mutual affection (Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton) and sometimes the relationship has been more arms-length (Dwight Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter, the two George Bushes), but, as Alan Schroeder makes clear in this book, the two have developed a mutual dependence on each other.Anyone who has followed politics and popular culture in recent decades will recall many of the incidents chronicled between these pages, but there is also much that hasn't been well-known previously. Did you know, for instance, that the relationship between Hollywood and the White House extends as far back as Woodrow Wilson's administration? Or than Dwight Eisenhower was the first president to make regular use of a media consultant (actor Robert Montgomery)? Marilyn Monroe singing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to JFK or Nixon meeting Elvis may provide the most enduring images in our collective memories; but as Schroeder makes clear, the reality of these relationships is often more subtle and complex. Presidents look toward Hollywood for a luster they might otherwise lack; stars are drawn toward the White House in hopes of gaining a degree of substance and credibility they can't claim on their own.Today, some Americans still decry the relationship between politics and show business. While Schroeder offers no definitive conclusions, his work helps us to see that the two will always be interdependent; perhaps we should be instead asking how to make the partnership more beneficial to the public good and insure that there's substance behind the glitter.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Celebrity-in-Chief: How Show Business Took Over The White House","review":"Our recent presidents have been celebrities in different ways, some in music, acting, scholars, military geniuses, former governors of states in these U. S. A.Mainly this book, compiled by Alan Schroeder (has quite a lengthy index of sources he used), relates the influence of show business on politics from the top on down. Harry Truman played piano passably and had a talented daughter, Margaret; he is shown performing with Jack Benny on the violin.Richard Nixon also played the piano and even performed on the Grand Ole Opry stage in Nashville, TN He invited Elvis Presley to the White House. Bill Clinton played the saxophone somewhat and was the butt of jokes on several t.v. shows. He promoted Barbra Streisand because she was a favorite of his dear Mother's. He also invited United Artists' producer Mike Medavoy to the White House and allowed him to sit in the chair there in the Oval Office and he and his wife spent the night there.Ronald Reagan should have the title of \\"celebrity\\" pres. but I think the title really goes to John F. Kennedy. He went all out to seduce movie stars with the assistance of his brother-in-law, actor Peter Lawford. He had an association with Frank Sinatra at the same time Sinatra was sharing a mistress with a Mafia leader. Politics are indeed strange bedfellows.Dwight Eisenhower welcomed Robert Montgomery and the pianist, Liberace, to the White House as he did his favorite (and mine) singer, Eddie Fisher, who sang 'Count Your Blessings.' Eddie also sang with a group of other male celebrities, 'Together' to JFK, as did his favorite, Marilyn Monroe.Gerald Ford, the non-President, only one to not be voted in by the populace, favored comedians off t.v. shows and John Wayne who narrated a fabulous collaboration to America and her people. He also like Carol Channing for some reason.Jimmy Carter, the scholar and chaste one, is shown with John Travolta who went on many years later to play a Presidential candidate in the movies.The moviedom out in California have always had a say in politics of this great nation. Hearst who built that marvelous mansion along Route 1 for his movie star, Marion Davises, owned the newspapers which could make or break a candidate.These are interesting ancedotes naming some big names. The photos are good. My favorite was of the thirty-two Hollywood stars who posed with Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940. Have things changed? Is L.A. still a dominant influence on the nation's politics and our leaders who must represent all states, not just one."},{"Title":"Celebrity-in-Chief: How Show Business Took Over The White House","review":"Alan Schroeder has written a compelling book highlighting the intermingling, balancing, and out right using that celebrities and presidents engage in with each other. The work is neatly divided into twelve chapters. The first five chapters are especially relevant for examining the relationship between presidents and pop culture. They are respectively entitled: Gilt by Association: How Entertainers are Good for Presidents, Attack of the Cat Woman: How Entertainers are Bad for the Presidents, Hope Springs Eternal: How Presidents are Good for Entertainers, Glad to Be Unhappy: How Presidents are Bad for Entertainers and Running Time, Entertainers on the Campaign Trail. Combined, these chapters represent the main achievement of the book by surveying the relationships between actors ,singers and presidents across time. At the end of the introduction, Schroeder aptly characterizes the depth and scope of America's infatuation with greatness: \\"Americans recognize only two branches of royalty: presidents and entertainers. Celebrity-in-Chief examines what happens when these aristocrats join forces.\\"Gilt by Association highlights numerous successful pairings of celebrities and presidents. In one telling example, actor Chuck Connors from The Rifleman was able to make a strong connection with Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev. President Nixon had invited Connors and numerous other stars to Casa Pacifica to meet the Soviet leaders. Connors even presented a cowboy hat and a pair of matching Colt .45 revolvers to Brezhnev. Later in the day, Brezhnev returned the favor with a big bear hug and an invitation for Connors to film in Russia. Schroeder summarizes the meaning of the encounter: \\"Nixon seemed pleased by having engineered the Connors-Brezhnev shotgun diplomacy, and why not? Another celebrity had come through for the president, making a human connection that Nixon could not make himself.\\" (22-23) Nixon with virtually unlimited access to the stars opposite influence seeking stars that come to help the president, are common themes throughout the work.However, not all celebrities are good for politicians. As Schroeder points out, we only need to harken back to LBJ's Cat Woman problem or Bill Clinton's so called \\"Lincoln Bedroom scandal.\\" Further, Schroeder relates story after story about individual celebrities and presidents. Whether it was a pathetic Elvis Presley requesting a drug enforcement badge, or Sammy Davis Jr. shunned by Kennedy, or an angry Frank Sinatra smashing his helicopter pad upon learning President Kennedy was visiting Bing Crosby instead of him, the celebrities are there and so are the presidents, for better or for worse.Schroeder argues that Presidents are celebrities in their own right. They have crossed the line into the realm of the highly recognizable personage, replete with power. Similar to the infatuation of the masses with movie stars, the public is in complete awe of a sitting president. They are the ultimate entertainer, the ultimate power and the most visible person in the world. Actors, and other celebrities, want to associate with this power, as do presidents with entertainers, as power meets power to further all ends.This book certainly highlights many telling, interesting and funny anecdotes of presidents and entertainers. However, this doesn't mean the work successfully argues a point of view. What was clear, is that the author views both parties as celebrities seeking fame, relevance and the trappings of greater power and influence. What is not clear from this work is how celebrities can influence public policy or presidents to take a certain path. Certainly, it is interesting reading to hear about the President Kennedy's linkages with various paramours, but that in of itself does not prove anything other than Kennedy was a philander who had access to the stars. Did it hurt his ability to pursue his agenda? Did these trysts influence his policy making? Granted, these questions may be outside of the scope of this work but they are relevant if this book is going contribute anything more to the historical record than a bunch of old People magazines can."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Just beneath the surface of Scumble River, the small town of Swanson's title, simmers a stew of sex and scandal which finally boils over. Skye Dennison, school psychologist, uses her brains, humor, and ultimately, great courage to solve the resulting murder, a crime her own brother has been accused of committing. The same characteristics enable Skye to help the kids she works with and put the administrator from hell she works for in his place. Both Skye's personal and professional lives are complicated by the fact that Scumble River is her hometown where she has roots, relatives, and memories. I loved seeing Skye disprove the old saying that you can't go home again and was chewing my cuticles until she solved the murder. What's more, this book made me think twice about e-mailing my high school boyfriend!"},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Not everybody loves cozy mysteries, I've learned. Those who don't appreciate them are free to ignore them, but it seems unfair to expect this genre to be something else.For those who do enjoy a good cozy, Murder of a Small Town Honey is well worth it. Swanson's self-depricating main character and her ongoing personal issues ring true to life, especially the youthfully arrogant valedictory speech that she is now having to live down at every turn. The humor is gentle, the characters engaging and the puzzle satisfying--all reasons why I favor the genre. I enjoyed my visit to Scumble River and will make a point to return at every opportunity."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"In the first book in the Scumble River mystery series, we meet amateur sleuth, Skye Denison for the first time. Skye is a school psychologist, returning home to live and work after humiliating herself while delivering a valedictorian speech 12 years prior. It seems that Skye left with a chip on her shoulder about \\"the small minds of those in a small town\\" and has to return home with her tail tucked firmly between her legs after losing her last job. Since she left her last job in disgrace (although not her fault), the only job she can get is in the school system that she shunned when she left town. While trying to re-establish herself in her hometown, she soon finds herself involved in a murder case in which her brother is the prime suspect. Skye spends an inordinate amount of time evading snooping relatives in this book, but still manages to solve the case and help her brother. But will this be enough for the town to accept her again?This book should definitely be considered a cozy mystery (a mystery that has no graphic violence, no gratuitous sex, and all of the bloodshed is \\"off-camera\\") in that it focuses a lot on characters. Some may criticize the book for not having a good plot, but I like to look at this book as a background for other books in the series. The mystery was decent, and I liked the descriptions of the town, the characters, and the situations in which Skye found herself. Skye has a lot of work to do healing her strained relationships with everyone in town, and I liked that she was a vulnerable character willing to admit mistakes. Having read all of the other books in this series, I would definitely recommend reading this book first for the background information, and then reading another in the series. I feel that the author gets better with each book, and I cannot wait to visit Scumble River again. Enjoy!A Cozy Lover"},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"When Skye Denison announced during her valedictory address that she &quot;can't wait to get away from this town of small minded people with small ideas&quot; she had no idea that 12 years later she would have to eat her words and move back to Scumble Creek.

When her brother is arrested for murdering his old girlfriend, she feels compelled to investigate and as she closes in on the killer she becomes a target.You can tell that the author has a great deal of experience with living in a small town and that she also feels affection for her characters.

The beginning of a book might start out too slowly for me and then pick up steam. This book caught my attention right off so that halfway through I stopped to order more of the series. Then poof, the story became totally flat with no chemistry between the characters. I plodded through the second half, forcing myself to finish. I regretted ordering more, but since then have read the next one (Murder of a Sweet Old Lady) and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Being both a mystery author (with his first novel in initial release) and a professional educator (with over twenty years of experience in a rural high school), I found Denise Swanson's MURDER OF A SMALL-TOWN HONEY satisfying in many ways. First of all, it introduces a winning amateur sleuth--Skye Denison. This protagonist is a contemporary every-woman, someone who is doing her best to do well in life on many levels--despite hardsips she encounters. Secondly, Ms. Swanson provides realistic insights into public education. She hits that social institution right on the bull's-eye. Thirdly, her tone and attitude is perfectly suited for the contemporary cozy-type mystery. Finally, MURDER OF A SMALL-TOWN HONEY has a fabulous mystery plot at its heart. It is a solid debut of what I hope will be a long line of Scumble River Mysteries."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Being a social worker myself, I found this to be a fun read. I found the ending to be just a bit weak and forced, but that may have just been because I'd had a hard day. Who knows? But I do plan to read the second in the series and hopefully the rest. Skye is the kind of person that I think I'd be friends with in real life, and I like her nerve.

This series is hysterical. Skye is friggin' hilarious!My favorite was the Cow Chip Bingo. I had to wipe the tears away. It was unbelievably uproarious!I would combust into fits of laughter telling anybody & everybody about the wickedly delicious Scumble River series.Watching Skye Denison return to her hometown was enjoyable. Skye is definitely well loved & is welcome w/ open arms. Of course, there are a few sarcastic comments made about her extra padding ~ she put on a few pounds while away from home.Skye offers to be a jelly judge at Chokeberry Days, a local tradition that had me doubling over from laughing so hard. Some Scumble River residents advocate it as a way to bring revenue into the town, while others oppose it, groaning it is bringing a little too much change.Swanson knows how to create characters who are a vibrant mix of personalities. Skye's a quick-witted woman w/ an abundance of intuition into human frailty. Swanson does an excellent job keeping Skye credible.Skye's dichotomy of indecision is spot on. Skye's thrilled to be home embracing her family's nurturing affection, yet disillusioned by her own feelings of inadequacy. Which Swanson does an extraordinary job describing. Bravo to Denise!!!Denise Swanson's Murder of a Small-Town depicts life in a small town effortlessly. I wanted to pack my bags for a weekend stay w/ Skye & the rest of the quirky Denison's.Murder of a Small-Town Honey is a charming, rapid paced mystery that will leave you absolutely impatient for your next visit to Scumble River.Hurry pick up a copy of Murder of a Small-Town Honey...Warning!

She is a school psychologist and has recently moved back home after losing her job.Skye stumbles upon a dead body and is shocked to learn that it was a woman by the name of Honey Adiar, who used to date Skye's older brother Vince in high school. Of course the police think Vince killed Honey. He claims not and Skye believes him.Skye's mother May works as a part-time dispatcher for the local police station. She wants Skye to find out who the real killer is. May thinks that Skye's background as a psychologist will be helpful - that people will open up to her.The relationship between Skye and her mother is interesting. They love each other but get on each other's nerves. I thought it was interesting that May wanted her to get involved. Typically a mother would not want her daughter trying to solve a murder mystery, so this is an interesting twist.Skye is smart, and does a good job of handling people and knows what to tactfully say in tough situations.I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Denison had left her hone town of Scumble River years ago never believing she would someday return. But Skye was back as the new school psychologist. Within one week Skye had managed to put off all the small-town busybodies (the number of which were astounding), get the school files in order (NOT easy), volunteer in the town's annual Chokeberry Days festival (which she had always hated), and find a dead body. Not bad for such a short time!The deceased was the host of a children's TV show and looked elderly. However, the elderly host turned out to be a young woman under a lot of make-up. Her name was Honey Adair. Honey had lived several year in Scumble River and the whole town hated her, for good reasons! However, Chief Boyd, for some strange reason, believed Skye's brother had murdered the woman and refused to even consider anyone else! So Skye began her own investigation.**** The first a great new series! The author does a wonderful job of creating realistic characters. Personally, I live in a small town too and am amazed at how well Denise Swanson captured the closeness of everybody. Everyone knows everything about everyone. The main character, Skye, showed part of her background. It seems that each book will show her family a bit about her family and personal life. This made the story even MORE realistic to me! Here is a perfect book to read on rainy days to kill the blues! Excellent! ****"},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"12 years ago, after insulting the general townspeople in her valedictorian speech, Skye Denison left Scumble River, planning on never coming back.Unfortunately, after a large, unnamed disgrace occurs (leaving Skye with no fiance and no job), she moves back to Scumble River to take up a job as a school psychologist. After she arrives, she is talked into being a judge for the chokeberry jelly contest at the annual festival-and soon discovers the body of a former Scumble River resident... who just so happens to be a celebrity.The problem? All the evidence points to Skye's brother, and the police don't seem to want to search after any other possible suspects. Despite much opposition, Skye takes matters into her own hands-and risks her own life in the process.I enjoyed this novel. Every scene where Skye does her actual job, beyond investigating, is a true pleasure. Unfortunately, that could not save the book. There is little to no character depth in any character beyond Skye, hunches on furthering her investigation come out of nowhere, and her opinions changed within one sentence. For instance, take her love interest in the story-Simon, who was the town's Coroner and funeral home owner. He was evil and nasty in the first half of the book, and downright saintly in the second half. It just doesn't work.However, this is a very good example of a debut novel. Here's to hoping the rest are as good or better than this."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Denison's adventures in this first Scumble River mystery by Denise Swanson, are very amusing and entertaining. I judge a book by how quickly I want to go to bed and read it. MURDER OF A SMALL-TOWN HONEY kept me reading--before my bedtime through after bedtme. I didn't want to stop reading it. An added clever touch are the chapter titles--you have to see them to believe them. Skye is a fully-dimensional person and takes you with her throughout the book. Very human, very relatable, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I have read several mystery series and always like to start with the first--believe me, some of them have been really bad, but as the author matured his (or her!) writing improved. This first novel by Denise Swanson is written like a seasoned author. Skye Dennison is a fun, intelligent, and very real character. I am from a small midwestern town and Ms. Swanson has captured the essence of living there, from jello salads to magenta polyester pansuits to employment nepotism. All of this humor and description is cleverly woven into a mystery involving, of course, a member of her family since she is related to almost everyone in town. I look forward to Ms. Swanson's next book."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"It's nice to see another novel set in rural Illinois where small towns and interesting characters abound. Denise has done a wonderful job of portraying both her protagonist, Skye Denison, and Skye's hometown of Scumble River. Skye's resourceful manner and dry wit are much needed when the Chokeberry Days festivities are interrupted by murder. Not one to sit back and watch from the sidelines, Skye gets involved in the investigation and eventually succeeds in her quest to unmask a murderer. This is a fine debut novel from a talented author. I look forward to the further adventures of Skye Denison."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"The reviews of this book led me to try it. And after having read it in its entirety, I think it most resembles a book written by a committee. Each individual member has his or her own plan for what's going to happen, and adheres to that regardless of what came before or after their section. Consequently, the book isn't quite sure of what it really wants to be.There are humorous parts, to be sure, and others that are so dry, they read like a catalog. Also, at times, I felt that the author went a tad overboard using caricature as a means of describing characters. They're almost too buffoonish to be real. And of all things, I tumbled to the 'whodunit' almost immediately, which was a major surprise, as I almost never figure it out before the author tells us who's the bad guy. Or gal.On the other hand, the small-town ambience of Scumble River seems absolutely right, as well as the Chokeberry Days Festival that happens every year with its carnival, and cooking contests. If you've ever been to such a small town festival, it will seem exactly right to you.Will I try the next book in the series? Probably. At least, one more."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Denison has returned to her hometown of Scumble River. It's not that Skye doesn't like her hometown, it's just that she thinks it's a small town with small-minded people and that it is too small for her, which is exactly what she told everyone during her valedictorian speech before she hot-footed out of town. With a bad relationship behind her she's now back in Scumble River and working as a school psychologist. While Skye tries to get used to being back in Scumble River, she has the Chokeberry Days festival to remind her just what small town is all about. However the Chokeberry Days festival isn't quite as she remembered it. This year it seems like someone is purposely setting out to give the festival a bad name with all sorts of pranks. No sooner is the festival underway, then Skye discovers the body of the celebrity brought in for the festival, a Mrs Gumtree. It seems the children's tv personality, Mrs Gumtree, is actually from Scumble River and when the police start pointing their finger at Skye's brother, Skye must do what she can to clear her brother's name.I've heard a lot of really good things about the Scumble River Mysteries, and I read the short story (Monster of a Chance) and the recent release (Murder of a Cat's Meow) recently. However, as everyone knows cozy mystery series are better when you start at the beginning, and I was glad to have recently found the first book at a library sale.The first Scumble River mystery is an engaging, fabulous read. Right from the very first page when Skye is thrusted back into small town life, judging the chokeberry jelly contest, I was hooked. If there is one book that I've read this month that I will say is a guaranteed page turner, then it is this one. I carried this book around with me everywhere, wanting to read just a few more pages, and stayed up past midnight to finish it!I loved the town of Scumble River, and how Skye is trying to adjust to living there again. You can tell that she really doesn't want to live in Scumble River, close to her family and everyone that she considers \\"small-minded\\", but unfortunately it was the last resort for a life that didn't turn out as planned. The relationship between Skye and her mom is what I would call a traditional mom-and-daughter relationship. It's not perfect and her mom has a funny way of showing she cares, and I could completely relate to it. At the end of the day though Skye and Vince's mom will do everything she can to save her son, even it involves dragging Skye in to solve a murder!!Everything about this story is well plotted: from the great characters to the murder. I'm sure Denise Swanson left enough clues for the reader to solve the mystery, but this seasoned mystery reader never managed to piece it together. I like when I'm kept guessing, and I was definitely kept guessing right till the end.I don't have any hesitation in recommending this first book in this series. If the rest of the series is anything to go by this is a great series, and one that I hope will just get stronger and stronger. If you haven't tried the Scumble River mysteries yet I strongly encourage you to race to the bookstore or library to pick up the first book in the series."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best start to a series I have read. Going to read all the rest. All I can say is once you start reading this book you will not wanna stop. I just felt so sorry for the Brother. And I just couldn't believe all the bad stuff that is happening to the people. For starters the kids music and instruments disappeared. The cows at the cow chip bingo. and the fish fry where salt was replaced with sugar. So all the people in town are worried what will happen next. well you will have to read the book to find out. You won't be sorry that you did. You will say wow great start to a series. So go pick up."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"What a wonderful beginning to a Cozy mystery series! Skye Denison has moved back to her hometown after leaving upon her high school graduation 12 years prior with a serious \\"I'm-better-than-this-town attitude.\\" Skye never expected to go back, but after a break up, loss of job and serious financial woes...there really is no better place for her to get back up on her feet. And that is all Skye has in mind when she returns home. She wants to put some work in, save some cash, and head right back out of Scumble River. Stumbling on a corpse sparks a change in Skye's short term plans.As Skye works on trying to find out more about the victim and solve the crime, the reader gets to enjoy small town life. There are quite a few people who aren't too keen on Skye any more, but plenty who are happy to see her back. Pretty much what you would expect out of people who really grow up and grow with you and then without you. It was also interesting watching her take on a job as a school psychologist, and that part totally gave me a new respect for the position.The mystery was perfect for me. I have read a lot of mysteries in my life (mostly thrillers), and I am always happiest when I do not immediately figure it out. Murder of a Small Town Honey also had the benefit of that the author didn't throw anyone so far into the limelight that you were sure it had to be them and then pull someone out of a hat that couldn't have possibly been involved. I hate when authors do that. It all tied up in a way that made sense.All in all this foray into mystery and a small town made me want to come back. I enjoyed Skye and her whole family. It was nice reading about a character who is not described as absolutely stunning. Skye is a character you can relate to, because we have all pretty much stuck our foot in out mouths at some point and had to deal with the ramifications. And most of us aren't a size 2. The town sounds terribly small with everyone knowing everyone else, but living in a smallish town myself, I can definitely see how that can be. It is something I may have found ridiculous several years ago. I so looked forward to learning more, I quickly ordered the next book in the series. Which I will review soon.I received this book through PaperBackSwap. I actually had no prior knowledge of the author, but the title grabbed me."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Series was recommended by a book lover on an Amazon discussion board. I enjoyed reading this book, not something you have to think about. Amusing without being knee slapping outrageous. Enjoyed the character development and history. Learning their secrets as the story unfolded. The interaction between all the characters were complete and kept you wondering. Loved the dive off the bridge and the little kid helping her. Had to adjust to the slow parts where the main character was giving history of the town and people. But, then it picked right up again. Ms. Swanson tells a story well and keeps your interest through the book. The small town feeling coming through the pages as you get to know everyone in the town."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best amateur sleuth mysteries I read all summer. School psychologist, Skye Denison is portrayed extremely realistically and I wasn't at all surprised to see in her bio that the author herself is a practicing school psychologist. I loved getting a behind the scenes look at schools in general and special education in particular. I hope Ms. Swanson includes even more of that element in her next book.Skye's return home to Scumble River after what she herself terms a 12 year escape is fun to watch. On one hand Skye wants to slip into town, do her job, save some money, and move out ASAP. But her family and the townspeople have other ideas. The author really nails the whole Midwest casserole culture to a T, but she does it with a light touch and with affection, not in a mean way.Another element I especially liked was the spin she puts on stereotypes. At first glance it is just very funny, but it also makes the reader reflect on her/his own prejudices.Although I read mostly for the characters, this book had a good solid mystery at its core. The story moves right along and if the first chapter of the next book (which is included at the end of this boook) is any way to judge, the pacing just gets better.The humor in this book is more of the giggle and smile to yourself type, than the laugh out loud kind, but there were a couple of places people looked at me funny as I let out a rather loud laugh or snort.I hope this new writer gets the large readership she deserves so we can enjoy many, more Scumble River Mysteries."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I was blown away by this debut novel. It is hard to believe that this is the first book this author has written. It has obviously been well polished and well edited. The wry humor and empathetic portrayal of both the town and the characters won me over.The various descriptions of the characters are unique and well rounded, not the same old tall/short, brown/blond type of narrative you see in lots of books.Skye is one of the most likeable sleuths I have met in ages. She's a real person, with troubles to which a lot of people can relate. Her reasonable explaination for her decision to quit dieting and accept the extra pounds is nicely slipped into the dialogue. Skye's dry sense of humor and obvious dedication to the children she serves gives her a personality that makes the reader want her as a friend. The mystery of her being jilted and fired has me anxiously awaiting the next book.Another interesting aspect of this novel is the inside look at what a school psychologist does. I love the scenes when Skye is doing her job.Although I don't want to give away the ending, let me just say it is a triumph for feminism and one of the more clever escape scenes that I've read.This is an author to watch. I feel sure her future includes an award for best first mystery.

That's what happened to me when I started reading MURDER OF A SMALL TOWN HONEY. This mystery contains everything I like in a cozy, a likable protagonist, a unique mystery, plenty of twists and false leads, and, most of all, a humorous outlook at life.When Skye left her small hometown full of small-minded people twelve years ago, little did she imagine she would be back, eating humble pie and looking for a job. She finds employment as a school psychologist with the Scumble River School District. In her job, she realizes many have grown stagnant in their jobs, and dislike being dissed in Valedictorian speeches. Oh well, this doesn't stop our protagonist; she plows right in, shows her concern for the students and does her job (These actions alone had me cheering!). Skye tackles the mystery weaved throughout this terrific cozy debut with the same unwavering courage, and it's a good thing she is a strong woman because not only does Skye find the body of the murdered TV personality, she sets her mind to solving the murder and risking her life to free the person they've arrested and if that isn't enough she accepts a...blind date.

But, the victim is not the sweet television host she appeared to be, and her secret past make Skye's brother the chief suspect. Can Skye cut through the resentment she left behind to find the real killer?I went into this book with high hopes based on the word of mouth the book was getting. However, I was mildly disappointed when I read it. Many of the supporting characters, including suspects, are little more the caricatures. The story is not a plot but little more then a series of events with a conclusion. Still, I was intrigued enough by the main characters to book a return trip to Scumble River.This book, from a first time author, does show some promise. Hopefully, the author will improve as the series progresses."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Isn't it nice to find a new series that isn't set in New York or Chicago or the deep South? Murder of a Small-Town Honey is set in rural Illinois! Even better, we have a totally different amateur detective -- she's a school psychologist working in her own home town. Just think of all the great secrets tucked inside those student files. There's a lot more than kids in this book, though. We meet a ton of natives including Skye's old crushes, her family (good and bad) and her new colleagues. The book moves along at a fast clip and some of the dialogue will make you laugh out loud. By the end of the book you'll feel at home in Scumble River. The preview of the second book in this new series looks even better. If you like Earlene Fowler's quilting books you will like Denise Swanson's new book."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I picked up the Scumble River mystery series because I was intrigued when I came across the title of Murder of Ken and Barbie. When I found it that it was a series, I decided that I had to get the entire series and read it in chronological order.For a first time author, this book was pretty good. I can't help but compare it to Muder She Wrote. The town Scumble River sounds alot like Cabot Cove and so do all the towns folk. Skye is a young beautiful woman who is a School Psychologist while Jessica Fletcher is a sweet old lady who is a Mystery Writer. While this is a contrast, both are alike in that they get involved in a murder which they have to solve in order to clear a friend or relative. In this book, Skye has to help clear her brother, Vince who has been accused of killing a woman named Honey. Both Jessica and Skye are alike in that they rub suspect the wrong way by trying to poke around for information.I happen to like Murder She Wrote so I enjoyed this cozy little book which I gave 4 stars only because it was not as suspenseful as most mystery. However I do like the fact that the author made a likable heroine and that her book does not rely on sex, violence and gore in order to attract an audience. I did not guess the identity of the killer until the last 10 pages or so just like on Murder She Wrote, you have to wait until the last 10 minutes of the show in order to have JB Fletcher reveal the killer and their motive."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"School psychologist, Skye Denison, is an amateur sleuth who had to leave her last school and has come back to her hometown of Scumble River, Illinois, where she swore she'd never return. Many people in town remember her high school graduation speech in which she did not talk nice about the town.I enjoyed this cozy and cannot wait to read more. The sleuth is likeable and the story moves quickly but she doesn't omit important items. There aren't so many characters that you lose track of who people are. She gets into a few sticky places (don't all amateur sleuths). It is a fun, quick read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Denise Swanson's debut mystery, Murder of a Small-Town Honey, is a honey of a read. She introduces us to small-town life at its most amusing--during a town event (The Chokeberry Days Festival) when the community is forced to work together for success. Because her heroine, Skye Dennison, is both an outsider and an insider (she has just returned after a twelve year absence) she is able to see below the surface and appreciate the absurdity.I really like the way Swanson shows us through the types of clothing Skye chooses to wear, that even though she has gained weight, she still thinks of herself as attractive.Swanson writes on several levels. If you want a light read it is there for you, but if you want to look a little deeper her characters have something to tell you. No one is who they seem in this book. Even Skye has secrets.Skye's mysterious background is a great point of interest. What happened in the years she was away? Why was she in the Peace Corps? Why was she fired? Why did her fiance jilt her? I'm guessing the answers to all these questions will have a future book of their own--and I can't wait. Her second book, Murder of a Sweet Old Lady, will be out in less than a month. I already have mine ordered."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Frankly, I'm glad that Ms. Swanson has only written two books, or else I wouldn't get any sleep! I read both books in two days, and stayed up until about 2am both nights to finish them.FANTASTIC!!! I loved them both, (Murder of a Sweet Old Lady was a hoot, as well.)I am addicted to Scumble River, and can't wait to read more. I live close to the area where the fictional Scumble River is, and really enjoyed her extremely accurate view of the people and area.The things that I liked best about the books, aside from the great characters, and sayings was that it was about very realistic people. It shows that you don't need an exotic location or famous people to have a great mystery.I am looking forward to the next book!Great job."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Denison is not only one of the newest sleuths to hit the block this year but also one of the best. I found this book filled with wry humor that bounced along in the quaint small town setting. A page turner, this book features a determined school psychologist, a cast of wacky townspeople, all who could be guilty of murdering that small town honey. Great job, Ms. Swanson!"},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This novel was a very entertaining introduction to a new series. The characters are entertaining and there are a few good plot twists. The main character's motivation for coming back to Illinois is never really explained. It doesn't make sense that a small town girl who spent four years in the Peace Corps would apire to high society in New Orleans while working as a school psychologist. That's a mouthful that needs more explanation. I'd like to know more about her and less about color coordinating your shoes to your outfit. However, this doesn't detract much from the story, and this is a diverting mystery."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Dennison is a school psychologist who has returned to her home town, and Mom's cooking, just in time for the annual Chokeberry Days Festival. It's immediately obvious to Skye that the town is separated on the future of the festival. To make matters worse, Skye stumbles onto the body of Mrs. Gumtree. Although the Chief focuses on Skye's brother as his #1 suspect, Skye starts making her own list of suspects, and now she becomes a target. This is a delightful little cozy with good hometown humor."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I think I have found another author that I really like. I'm addicted to Sue Grafton and a few others, but haven't found a new author that I look foward to. I guess her new book will be out next year. It was a fun read that unfortunatley didn't last long. I finished the book in one afternoon. Read the book and have fun!!"},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey is the first installation of the Scumble River series featuring school psychologist, Skye Denison. Skye has returned to Scumble River after being fired from her job in New Orleans. When she left Scumble River after high school, she made sure the whole town knew she thought they were a bunch of small town bumkins with no intelligence. As she tries to adjust to small town life again (while hoping everyone forgets what she said as a teenager) she stumbles upon the murder of the star of a Chicago area children's show. Skye digs into the woman's past to try and find the person responsible for her death, so Skye can clear her brother's good name.Unfortunately, the book was hardly about the actual plot and all about Skye and her day to day life and how issues from her past are still affecting her. Honestly, if you took out all the fillers about Skye's work, putting on her make up, and doing the dishes, you would end up with a novella. Readers really didn't need to know all about the WISC-III intelligence testing or all the details about IEP evaluations -- and we know how to do our dishes!The character development was also odd -- every male not related to Skye was an agressive jerk for the most part. Almost every woman was some sort of extreme eccentricity -- her aunt was a major gossip, a cousin was a big witch with a B, a teacher & suspect was a frail and cowering woman, and Skye's mom was an agressive busybody. With Skye's personal issues and broodiness, there really wasn't a character to get attached to and cheer for -- except for her brother, but he was rarely in the picture!When the author did finally focus on the plot, things came effortlessly to Skye - everything fell into her lap. There was no real struggle to finding evidence or information, because every time she went looking for it -- the details appeared.Even though I like an easy read every now and then, this book was so filled with trivial & unimportant details and I felt my time and money was wasted."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Half way through this book I decided I could care less about any of the characters. Badly written. Shallow."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Despite the interesting array of characters, the plot isn't a deep mystery and is almost a series of events that just falls into its own conclusion. Skye never did much amateur sleuthing as far as I could tell, with luck on her side. Also, while I did enjoy the people, sometimes they felt a little overdone to the point of putting in too much forced comedy. There were some cute and amusing moments, but this isn't really a laugh out loud sort of book, more of a cozy (which is always good). The small atmosphere fits the story - and the series - perfectly. Some of the dialogue seems a bit stifled and forced, not completely genuine, but overall this book was a fun way to pass the time and the pace kept my attention to a maximum.Overall a fun and light read without enough substance to stand out too much. I really dug Skye as a heroine and look forward to reading about the characters again."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Denison is a terrific heroine, and the town of Scumble River never fails to entertain. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"When I started reading, I thought I had a really great find -- a debut that was well-written and had tons of potential as a series. However, by the time I finished, I was disappointed.While the book was written well, I didn't find any of the character likeable in the least. And when it was revealed that the murderer was the most obvious choice of all the people Skye suspected, I felt like I'd wasted my time. I also was bothered by the fact the author kept hinting at some secret in Skye's past that was the catalyst for her returning home, but we never got any details about it.I certainly hope the next story in the series is told better."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Sheriff Buck Peterson: \\"I don't know why you're so riled up, May. I'm not accusing Skye of nothing.\\"May: \\"Right. And I'm not saying if brains were water, you wouldn't have enough to baptize a flea.\\"Denise Swanson- Murder of a Real Bad BoyToday's choice for my book to read and then donate to Better World Books was another in the Scumble River Mystery Series by Denise Swanson. Along with the witty dialogue I have come to expect from her books, this one held my interest with some clever side stories as well as some intriguing new characters.In Murder of a Real Bad Boy, Skye Denison soon discovers that while the contractor she hired is easy on the eyes, he is definitely hard on the bank account. The little work that is actually getting done on the house she inherited is subpar to say the least. She realizes that she is not the only one displeased with Beau Hamilton when she arrives home and finds that he has been murdered. And as an unhappy home owner, Skye looks like a prime suspect to Sheriff Buck Peterson.In between finding her lost cat, exploring her feelings for Wally, and finding out what secret her brother is keeping, Skye needs to figure out who really killed the all-thumbs contractor. But her meddling may end up getting her killed."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Getting fired and returning back to Scumble River wasn't part of Skye Denison's plan. Unfortunately, Scumble River is the only place that will now hire her as a school psychologist. Little did she expect that her return would also include a murder... with her only brother as the only suspect! Can Skye find the real murderer while readjusting to the eccentricities of life in a small town?Skye Denison just skyrocketed to the top of my list of favorite amateur sleuths! Skye's dilemmas over students and their educational needs add just the right touch of authenticity to her character. Too often fictional books about psychologists, social workers, or the school system miss the sort of attitude and atmosphere needed to truly capture the environment. Denise Swanson not only succeeds at this but rather she excels at it. In fact, Denise Swanson perfectly melds the unique flavors of working within the school system and life in a small town into one heck of a great read.Skye is the sort of school employee you want on your side. She's feisty but she cares. Whether it's making a home visit into the middle of nowhere or testing a very shy student, Skye is a professional with a heart of gold. I couldn't help but love how her mom and others perceive her role as a school psychologist.MURDER OF A SMALL-TOWN HONEY is a book in which readers will cherish each and every moment. From the humor of the Chokeberry Days Festival with its infamous Cow Chip Bingo to the antics of the various characters, MURDER OF A SMALL-TOWN HONEY is sheer fun. I can't wait to read the next book!

When I read mysteries I never try to guess who did it. I prefer to just enjoy the unfolding story. However, I figured out who did it without even trying. The story wasn't very original and the motive behind the murder was so (for lack of a better word) lame.I may give Ms. Swanson another try just to see if she has improved."},{"Title":"Murder of a Small-Town Honey (Scumble River Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Skye Denison swore that she would never go back to the small town in Illinois where she grew up, but a job loss and a broken engagement changed her mind. Soon she finds herself involved in Scrumble River activities, such as the Chokeberry Days Festival. All is well until a visiting celebrity is found dead. The victim is a young woman who grew up in Scrumble River, and the #1 suspect is Skye's brother Vince. When she puts her investigative powers to work, Skye discovers that the victim had a lot of enemies. In between her job as a school psychologist and her budding romance with a local man, Skye finally discovers the identity of the murderer when she is kidnapped and threatened by the perpetrator.

But the hometown folks haven't forgiven her for telling them off 12 years earlier, and the police chief is determined to prove her brother Vince murdered a vicious former resident.Mostly believable characters make a pleasant change in this fast read. Skye isn't a wuss, she just gets out-maneuvered. The obligatory romance did not ring true, and the stereotypical religious-type character was unbelievable as well as annoying.

It is nice to look at, but the content is very biased and non-scholarly. The author oftens voices his opinion about what is 'acceptable' or 'attractive', and questions people who use body modification to &quot;take things too far&quot;. There IS a wide variety of body modification discussed and shown in the book, however, the author often repeats things he had previously stated in the book, making for very little content of value. Overall, not one of the better books on the subject. Check out Bodies of Subversion by Margot Mifflin, or The Art of the Tattoo by Ferguson &amp; Procter for better histories of tattooing, as well as any Modern Primatives issues."},{"Title":"Return of the Tribal: a Celebration of Body Adornment","review":"&quot;Return Of The Tribal&quot; is a book that delves into body adornment cross-culturally and throughout history. The book is relatively short, but is packed with great photos and content.If you don't already own Modern Primitives, you might want to start there first. This book doesn't have as good of written content, though I personally found it to have better and more varied photography.Overall, the book is a must-have for the library of anyone interested in body modification (either on a tribal level or in Western culture). &quot;Return Of the Tribal&quot; could work as a (small) coffee table book or a reference text. Short, but very sweet."},{"Title":"Return of the Tribal: a Celebration of Body Adornment","review":"I've got many books on tattooing and body piercing and I consider this one of my favourite. It looks at the possible reasons why people in the west get body decorations and compares them to the ritualistic purposes there are in tribal cultures. I like it a lot because it focuses on the ancient and traditional aspect of body piercing, tattooing and scarification. It contains excepional photographs(all colour) and goes into great depth and detail. It doesn't talk about body art in a superficial stand point but considers it as an art with a very ancient history. I feels its a very worthwhile read which i constantly reread and refer to and it never is boring."},{"Title":"Return of the Tribal: a Celebration of Body Adornment","review":"This is a one of a kind book cuntains photos(full color) like I've never seen before!

It also underlines every occurrence of \\"store\\" or \\"buy.\\" Is this some weird subliminal message? It has a very small font, which is strange given that the target audience for this book would be ages 8-12. The interior pictures were repetitive versions of the ugly cover picture.

Find another edition and buy that."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"This biography is a quick overview of Stonewall Jackson's life and is written more as a historical sequence of events rather than a revealing depiction of the man's character."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"John Bowers' interpatation of the life of Stonewall Jackson is well researched and has a very interesting narative style. The license he takes with his descriptions I found novel and enjoyable, particularly his takes on Stonewall's early life and his time at VMI prior to the war. Coupeling imagination with history Bowers has produced a Shelby Footesque story about one of the most famous American military men. I highly recommend this read to anyone who enjoys the stories of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"As would be expected, there are a number of Jackson biographies, some outstanding, some very good, and some not good at all. This one falls into the last category. Written in narrative form like Shelby Foote for whom the author professes great admiration. This book misses the mark badly. There is no bibliography or footnotes, there are a number of anecdotes that are absent from any of the 8 other biographies that I have read. Lacking the previously mentioned documentation one has to wonder as to their veracity. The author frequently interjects supposed conversation between characters; these attempts are weak at best. At least one of the photographs (the one on the dust cover) is suspicious. The three most common Jackson photos are included (the famous missing button photo, the photo from just prior to Chancellorsville, and one as a beardless young officer from the Mexican War time period). I have read numerous Jackson biographies and other Civil war books and have never before seen this photo. I am not convinced it is actually Jackson. If you want the ultimate biography of Jackson go to James I. Robertson's Stonewall Jackson: The Man, the Soldier, the Legend."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"The first edition of this book had the face of a union cavalry man on it's cover.

If you really want to meet Stonewall read James Roberstson's \\"Stonewall\\".One star for the fun of the cover."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"I was enjoying this book until I read a note by the author stating that he had created dialogue where none was recorded. He says that he put as he would have imagined Jackson would have. I suppose he did the to move the narrative along, but in my opinion, this is inexcusable! I cannot honestly refer to anything found in these pages as fact knowing that parts are admittedly fabricated."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"John Bowers has written an eloquent account of Jackson, one of the South's most colorful and enigmatic generals. The author approaches the material with a sensitivity that is often lacking in Civil War literature. He does not attempt to hide behind a facade of objectivity, but rather tells us from the get go that he's a Southerner, with family ties to both sides of the fraternal conflict. I could identify with Bowers reluctance to draw near \\"that deep hole of obsession from which few Civil War buffs return.\\" I have a grandmother who is supposed to have been from the South. From that point on I became hooked into reading the work with a kind of amused detachment. What emerged for me was a vivid image of the War Between the States \\"true eccentric\\"(Shelby Foote). On a more abstract level, I found myself entertaining the notion that there must be some value in eccentricity, as illustrated by the general's military genius. After all, wasn't eccentricity the heart of Romanticism? a popular movement throughout the culture of the South and the Civil War era. The kind of individualism that Jackson champions in his \\"ideal Rebel\\" state, seems to have all the ear marks of a great Romantic quest. The archetypal warrior (and we are all warriors on some level as readers) must view the world in terms of vision rather than as a kind of soul less empirical truth. At the risk of being completely misunderstood, I can't help believing there was more at stake in this \\"eccentricity\\" than the antiquated racial theories the General and his supporters defended. This book certainly facilitated my thinking about a very important chapter in American history. It is for me a highly commendable biography."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a biography, but it is by no means boring. I read it as a senior in high school. I was never a bookworm, but I began reading this book and couldn't put it down.

Robertson's work on the subject."},{"Title":"Stonewall Jackson: Portrait of a Soldier","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that this reads like a summary, or overview, of Jackson's life.

There isn't a lot of detail over battles. Actually, most battle sections in the book are about 2 pages once the fighting starts.Read this book for an enjoyable read on the mind and heart of Stonewall.

For some reason best known to the book's designer, all the paragraphs begin with flush-right instead of indented left paragraphs. It's very distracting, and, combined with the Ariel sans serif typeface, makes the book more of a chore to read.I bought this edition but actually have had to switch to the Google Books version because the design choices are so annoying.That said, the book is a fine picture of turn-of-the-century urban Chicago life (the \\"cliffs\\" are the skyscrapers in which Chicago residents live)."},{"Title":"What Now? a Handbook for New Parents","review":"Well, it saved my sanity, that's all. This is a book for parents. It goes over all the things that other books do, then tells you what really happens. It contains life-savers like Barry Brazelton's method for dealing with a colicy baby.
