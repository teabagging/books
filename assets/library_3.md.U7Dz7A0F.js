After their first investment in the \\"triangle slave trade\\" (slaves from Africa to the Carribean, sugar and molasses from the Carribean to New England, distilled spirits from New England to Africa), the partnership broke apart. Eventually, Moses converted and became a Quaker, and one of the leading pre-revolutionary abolitionists; while John became one of the leading spokesmen defending the New England based slave trade.Using this family split, Rappleye tells the story of the American Revolution through the lens of the slave trade. This was NOT a north-south issue, as most history books portray it. Rather, it was a split with slave traders of New England (who held political power in many of the northern colonies), who wanted unlimited right to trade in anything they wanted. Joining the northern traders were the landed gentry of the deep southern states who needed more slaves. The mid-Atlantic states had few traders, and the landed interests wanted the higher prices for their existing slaves, needed no more slaves, and thus had an economic interest in barring the import of additional slaves. Finally, there were the abolitionist--mostly religious--who wanted to abolish slavery altogether.In Rhode Island and many other states, the pro-slavery forces initially won out (Moses was completely marginalized politically on the slavery issue for most of the period leading up to the revolution, and for several years after), and bills to bar the slave trade were first resoundingly defeated, and then once passed, not enforced. As the economic base (and I suspect the voting franchise--an issue Rappleye doesn't discuss) expanded, the traders lost ground, and abolition became the trend in the northern states, eventually leading to the abolition (at least on paper) of the slave trade nationally.Rappleye has given us a fascinating perspective on the American Revolution--a perspective not usually covered. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution","review":"While there is a lot of interesting information in this book, much of it is redundant and repetitious, while the presentation leaves a lot to be desired. In the end this is the story of two brothers who spent their lives on opposite sides of the slavery issue. Moses who originally was involved with the outfitting of ships that went to Africa, later became a Quaker and a fighter for the end of slavery and the slave trade.John Brown spent a lifetime cheating everyone he could, lying and cheating everyone he came in contact with (including his family). But Rappleye never calls him to task. Prior to the outbreak of the American Revolution, John instigated the burning of a British man-of-war. He was arrested and sent to Boston for trial. Moses went to Boston and was able to secure John's release on the promise that John would stay out of politics. John never did and just went on his merry way. During the war he built privateers which he armed with his cannons from is foundry, but delayed the launch of a Continental Frigate in Boston by constantly delaying delivery of canon he had promised.During the war John was very happy to deal with the Continental Congress but did all he could to charge outrageous prices on goods he sold to both the Continental Army and Navy. After the war he convinced the Congress to buy a ship that he had built that never sailed well and was called 'the worst ship in North America'. During most of his life he continued to invest in ships that dealt with the slave trade while constantly promising that he would stop. While a member of the US Congress he was able to get Bristol RI declared a separate 'Revenue District' so that his friends could continue to pursue the Slave Trade after it was outlawed by the Congress and the State of Rhode Island.His brother Moses worked for twenty-five years for manumission of all slaves in RI, but could never convince John to do the same. So John was not cantakerous, he was crooked and Moses was a fool for always expecting his brother to live up to his promises. When John died, he left an estate of over $250,000, but he also left debts of over $150,000.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution","review":"uncovers what the history books have been trying to hide. america almost ended slavery at the very begining"},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"This book is really outstanding. I recommend it to anyone who has just lost their father or for someone who has not gotten a handle on their loss however long ago it was.Clea Simon writes as though she is speaking directly to you. She tells her own painful story and comforts her reader in doing so. Ms.Simon tells of many other women's experiences of losing their fathers so the reader gets many different perspectives on father/daughter relationships and how these daughters dealt with losing their fathers.Fatherless Women, for me, chronicled all the feelings I had felt, did feel and would feel during the grieving process. I was very comforted by this book. It made me feel I was part of a group so I stopped feeling so alone and isolated. It made me familiar with my feelings so I could give a name to what I am/was going through.Her book is an easy to read, informative, reassuring and very personable account of one of the most difficult things women go through.I would not have been able to begin my healing without this book.

With other stories, we're shown how this new insight not only helps us with our sadness and guilt -- it can also free us to be the women we want to be, taking the best of our fathers' legacies to us and dumping the worst (including our own overreactions).

I'm still having a hard time reading it; not because it's not easy reading, but because of the depth of emotion it conjures up as it pushes me to reflect on the relationship between me and my dad. No matter how old I get, I will always miss him and wish I could have stayed young and he could've lived forever. I think when I get to the end of this book, I will have gone through more healing through my grief.

As a woman who had a good relationship with her dad and who was lucky enough to find love and closure at the end of his life, I haven't found this book to be of much help to me personally. I grew tired of reading so many negative examples of what the father/daughter relationship could be, and I found very little comfort or guidance through my own grief. I think this book could be valuable for some, but it wasn't the help I had hoped for."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"I heard an interview with Clea Simon on a public radio show, and having lived through the loss of a close relative myself, I invested in her book. I found it to be a comforting and perceptive book, with many interviews that shed light on the possibility of living through loss and getting beyond it. Simon is generous with her own reflections, and her writing is lovely. I will be recommending this book to my friends."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"I tried to read this book after the death of my Dad due to a long battle with cancer. This author can only \\"help\\" or more accurately share stories of how dysfunctional her relationship with her father was, and how promiscuous she was, what a bad friend she was to those around her, rather than actually tell you anything about what life is like after the death of a father that you had a healthy relationship with. If you are normal and your father is normal, and you were friends with your father, this book is not for you. If you need therapy and your Dad needs therapy, here is clearly the book for you.This book is full of sweeping generalizations to validate the author's bad decisions in the relationships in her life. It is not backed up with any research or facts of any kind. She should have bought a journal and written about the bad relationship in private rather than publish it. Please do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"While I found it difficult to embark on reading a book on this topic (as my wound is relatively new and certainly unhealed) it was comforting to read about similar feelings and emotions women who've also lost their father are feeling.

In the very least, it was nice to take the time to help face my loss."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"This is a warm, meaningful book on life after losing a father - one of the greatest losses you can experience in life. It's so encouraging to know that I am not alone - that every emotion I feel is okay and there are plenty of other women out there feeling the same way I do. This is a very helpful guide on surviving this difficult time and gaining insight into my life and the life of my father."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"... Clea Simon, truly, is a very gifted writer. I found this book to be engaging, personal, reflective, sensitive, and wonderful. I could almost put myself in her shoes as I read about her thoughts and feelings, her stories about the lives of other women in similar circumstances, and her commentaries on our sociological condition as a generation of people who are struggling to make our own, new ways out of the old paradigm of the patriarchal past, a paradigm which has certainly paid its toll on all of us.... Nevertheless, this is not a book about politics; far from! It is a book about one woman's journey through life, specifically relating to the issues surrounding the loss of her beloved father, and how she reconciled all of her feelings concerning this loss. Along the way, she weaves a tapestry of the tales of other women who also dealt with issues surrounding their fathers, and how the loss of their fathers may have affected them in positive and / or negative ways. The inclusion of all of these other stories makes this a far richer and more interesting book than if it were only about the life of the author. In fact, I can see this book being used as a textbook in college sociology courses on family values. It is that good!... Here is an example of one insight she shares with us, from pages 64 and 65: \\"Indeed, the best indication of how we will grieve and recover from our loss may not lie in how our fathers die, but in how we dealt with them living. And for those of us who were unable to make peace with our fathers during their lifetimes, our way to peace and to healing may lie in accepting this lack of resolution, accepting our own and our fathers' flaws. Even if our fathers cannot at this final crisis abandon their illusions about their role, and our relationship, we must. For only by letting go of the fantasy of the perfect daddy, and of the perfect deathbed reconciliation, can we achieve anything resembling closure.\\" ... How intuitively profound!... You know, I picked up this book in order to help me better understand people who are close to me who have lost their fathers at an early age, in order to be more sympathetic toward them and more considerate of their feelings and experiences. I was well rewarded, for, not only did I gain a greater understanding of the feelings of the loss of one's father from the perspective of a daughter, I also learned that many of these emotions are shared by ALL of us. Ultimately, we ALL have to one day face the inevitable loss of BOTH our parents - our fathers AND our mothers. Reading this book, somehow, makes that inevitable, one-day reality just a bit easier to accept and understand. It's a great comfort to the soul. ... BRAVO, Clea Simon! ...

Although our Father's were educated in different ways, the grief of a slow death is much different. My Father's illness lasted for six years and I felt like he died a million times before the actual death. Clea has taken an uncomfortable reality and placed it on a page for confirmation and viewing by all who have suffered the loss of our greatest Love as daughters. This is an amazing find!!!"},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"None of my friends have lost their fathers. This book REALLY helped me process the grief, the hole in my psyche that his death caused, and how little things like buying a new stereo can tear a hole in your heart without your dad there. I recently had major storm damage to my house that required a new roof, and got totally hosed by the insurance company AND the roofers. They would have NEVER messed with Dad! And I bought a TV and felt so LOST without Dad's advice, he knew SO much about all things electronic. He was always on my side. It's hard to have the absence of his presence as Guardian Angel of All Things Mechanical and Otherwise without tears. And there were the big bear hugs. How do you part with the only man on the planet that thinks you rock? God, I miss my Dad. This book really helped me cope when I didn't have anyone else with real-time experience to talk to.

I still have a lot of unresolved issues surrounding my father's death and it has impacted me in a very negative way. I thought this book would provide me some insight into why I am still having problems with my dad's death. I related to some of the book, but not all of it. The author's circumstances were very different from mine but she does include interviews with many other women, some of whom I could relate to and some that I couldn't. I am not really sure if it has given me the additional insight I had hoped for but it a well researched and well written book and is worth reading. It seemed more of a personal journal of the author's life and her father's death rather than a psychological study of how our fathers' death affects us, but I am glad I read it anyway."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"I bought this book about a month after my father passed away this past March. I took immediate solace in the author's words and actually burst into tears upon learning in the first few pages that her father also passed when she was 31 years old. At times, I felt like the book was written specifically for/to me. Aside from the author's healing words, some of the insights about the father/daughter dynamic were eye-openers for me. The one part that sticks with me most is when the author discusses how the death of a mother is a much more painful experience for the average woman, but the death of a father creates more change in an adult daughter's life. This is a wonderful book for women in their 30's and 40's who overall had a healthy relationship with their fathers. 5 months later I'm still having a very difficult time grieving my father's death, but every now and then a passage from the book will pop into my head that I can take comfort in.

If you are looking for a book that will give researched based analysis from a psychiatrist or a therapist about what happens to women after we lose our fathers, this is not the book that you want to read. But, if you are looking for a book that will make you feel a kinship with other women who have lost their fathers then this is a great read. I would often have to put it down because the book conjured up so much emotion when I would read it. The author lost her father after a long battle with cancer, which is what happened to my father so that was very helpful to me. When I was finished, I didn't feel like I understood the process of grieving any better; I still found myself thinking certain things and wondering if they were normal. But, I did feel like the way that I felt about losing my father, the way that I felt about remembering him and things that I wanted to do as a legacy for him made sense because many of the women who had contributed their stories felt the same way."},{"Title":"Fatherless Women: How We Change After We Lose Our Dads","review":"I was in London on vacation and happened to see a write-up on this book in one of the tabloids!

For those of us who believe that there is a reason for everything that may happen, this book gives us pause.Howard Beamish decided at the early age of 6 when he picked up an ammonite on Blue Anchor Beach that things were not always what they seemed. When he asked what is was he was told a stone. Howard knew it was not a stone and told his father so. This was the kind of boy Howard was and the kindof man he grew into. He liked orderliness, symmetries, and classification. He wanted language to be technical, complex and innovative. He would rather read than socialize.He became a lecturer at Tavistock College. He had relationships that did not last. He enjoyed sex very much but he found he did not have much affection for the woman, and he didn't feel it was fair to carry on with that kind of attitude.Lucy Faulkner, on the other hand, knew at the age of fifteen that she would not follow in her mother's footsteps. Her mother was unable to tell the children their father was gone because she didn't realize it herself until Lucy told her sister that her father would not becoming back. Lucy in a sense became the mother of the family. She made sure her brother and sister had the right education for them. Lucy became a journalist. She fell off a bus and ran into a friend who happened to tell her of a job opening at a paper. Again a chance encounter and coincidence. Lucy, however, knew that she deserved the job and she became quite famous and well read. Lucy was unable to tolerate most men for very long. She loved sex but was unable to fall in love.Both Howard and Lucy find themselves on the same plane on their way to Nairobi. The plane has engine trouble and is diverted to a small island, Callimbia. All of the British passengers are kept hostage by a very strange dictator. Howard and Lucy find themselves falling in love in the most unusual circumstances. One of them is placed in a precarious position. Another one of Penelope Lively's simple statements- love can be found and taken away.This novel is fast paced and lively. The lives of the two principle characters are so rich and full. We love them both- we want happiness for them. Why must these strange situations that replicate life be so annoying? The trauma of the daily life that accosts them may change them forever. Another one of Penelope Lively's wonderful books. She has such a polished style and awesome control with her words. My favorite author.prisrob"},{"Title":"Cleopatra's Sister","review":"This book has sat on my bookshelf for about 2 years, and when I was about to embark on a short plane trip and needed a packable book, knew I could depend on Penelope Lively for an entertaining several hours, and I was right.

In Cleopatra's Sister, she introduced us to two people who meet when their plane makes a forced landing in the fictitious country of Callimbia in No. Africa. Fear and terror in hostile surroundings up the odds for our lovers, Howard and Lucy, as well as for the other passengers, and the story soon becomes a delicious Third World satire.

Lively has an ear for dialogue, creates three dimensional and believable characters whom one really cares about, and is full of fascinating and generous insights.

(The others are \\"Moon Tiger\\" and \\"The Photograph\\"). Once the novel's action moves to the fictional land of Callimbia, the book becomes quite engrossing, but half the novel is over. Neither of the two main characters, Howard and Lucy, is particularly memorable. Given Lucy's profession, she seems a bit clueless when thrust into the middle of a major news event.I had never read a fictional account of a hostage situation, and found this one credible. Two secondary characters stand out: Howard's girl friend, who does not really like him, but the sex is fine, and she likes being part of a couple; the translator, who thinks of himself as a nice person, and is not wrong exactly, but who is quite willing to serve as an instrument of evil."},{"Title":"At The Edge Of The World","review":"For a generation of fantasy readers, this was our introduction to the exquisite short stories of Lord Dunsany, courtesy of editor Lin Carter's wondrous Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series. It includes such essentials as the compact epic \\"The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth,\\" which accomplishes in a few pages what other writers fail to do half as well with hundreds; the powerful & haunting \\"Poltarnees, Beholder of Ocean,\\" in which the heroic young suitor of the beautiful princess discovers something far more entrancing, a story ending with bitterly tragic lines; and \\"Idle Days on the Yann,\\" which contains enough seed material for a dozen novels. But those are merely a few examples. Some of these stories have the ringing, lyric beauty of old myths & legend; others are edged with a satiric, wicked wit. But all champion Beauty, and are shining examples of it.These stories can easily be found in contemporary reprints & anthologies of Dunsany's work, and any serious reader of fantasy is encouraged to seek them out. But if you should spot a battered paperback copy of this particular volume in a used bookstore or at a rummage sale, pick it up. Carter's notes are an additional treat, and the evocative cover art by Ray Cruz is a reminder of a better day in paperback publishing, before generic fantasy art became so rampant.

Indeed, it was the volume that I kept when I was faced with thinning my personal library. It is good that this little paperback was so well selected, since for decades it was the only affordably priced example in print.The editor (Lin Carter) lovingly selected stories from seven of Dunsany's eight volumes of short fantasy written between 1905 and 1919. There are eight tales from TIME AND THE GODS, one from THE SWORD OF WELLERAN, two from FIFTY-ONE TALES, seven from A DREAMER'S TALES, seven from THE BOOK OF WONDER, two from THE LAST BOOK OF WONDER, and three from TALES OF THREE HEMISPHERES. There is also an excellent, informative introduction about the author and his works, plus every section has an short intro telling something of Dunsany's life at the time he wrote the stories.I won't try to describe Dunsany's writing style here. Some call it fluff, but to me these are somewhere between rare jewels and solidified dreams.

The author maintained that Mormons remains true to the concepts of the Republic even although they were leaning toward theocracy. The book was well written, appears to be well researched and the author maintained an even approach while exploring his premise. Its a good book, quite insightful and should be read by anyone interested in Mormon history."},{"Title":"Upheaval from the Abyss: Ocean Floor Mapping and the Earth Science Revolution","review":"When I teach plate tectonics to my high school students, I ask them to consider the difficulty of building a comprehensive theory of the surface of the Earth when you don't know what three quarters of that surface looks like. I also mention how amazing it is that Alfred Wegener got as far as he did with continental drift without the detailed knowledge of the sea-floor that led to the modern theory of plate tectonics. David Lawrence has done a supremely good job at telling the adventurous and exciting history of plate tectonics in his book Upheaval From The Abyss. This book has got it all: ships, submarines, sonar, scientific [and emotional] arguments, sea-floor spreading, subduction, explosives and so much more. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to go deeper into the history of plate tectonics than does the standard cardboard cutout version found in most textbooks, and especially for those interested laypeople not ready to dive into Naomi Oreskes' excellent, but highly detailed The Rejection Of Continental Drift. I really enjoyed Upheaval From The Abyss and feel that others will, too."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"All ingredients of a first class Mary R. Rinehart are displayed in the first pages of the Yellow Room. A huge house in the country, belonging to a wealthy family : the first daughter is a \\"jet-set\\" woman, far from ordinary human feelings ; the second daughter Carol, the heroine, is more engaging, unaffected, a lovely girl. It seems the boy she was engaged to was killed in the Pacific, but it's not so sure. Her brother is a WWII hero, but it appears there's something not so clear in his past. The corpse of an unknown young woman is found in the house, and we discover she's connected with the family. Incidents and accidents, attempts of murder and murder occur more and more often at night, and the police net closes on Carol. Well, of course, here comes a man, an ex soldier but not a super-hero, who'll help Carol and solve the mystery. The girl falls obviously for him, and all's well that end's well, but there's no preciousness in the story. The conclusion, as always, is unexpected and great. Old fashioned, yes, but to be read with great pleasure."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"I personally love mysteries set in the \`40s and earlier with a female heroine. This fits the bill! I love the details of the era and the writing style that comes along with writing in that time period."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"Mary Roberts Rinehart wrote some terrific mysteries dating back to the early 1900's. The Yellow Room, originally published in 1945, is one of her best. It is old-fashioned in a good way. This is a classic and very entertaining example of the mystery genre. There is a pretty young girl, a murder, suspects and intrigue involving the young woman's family and, of course, a dashing war hero in love with the heroine and only too willing to use every means at his disposal to get her out of the jam and solve the mystery. Rinehart creates a fun and exciting atmosphere for mystery lovers to enjoy, as well as a pretty good brain teaser.Young Carol Spencer is a likable heroine trying to recover from the loss of her fiance in the South Pacific. She longs to keep busy and wants to make herself useful in the war effort. She has been forced to care for her mother, however, as her selfish sister Elinor is too busy in her society functions to help. When Carol leaves New York for Maine to open up their home there, she discovers many unsettling mysteries.Lucy, the maid, is mising, and it is discovered that she is in the hospital with an injured leg. Someone chased her in the night and she fell down the stairs. Someone has been staying in the yellow room, even though no one was living in the Spencer's Maine home. Worse, there is a very dead young woman in the closet. When it is discovered that she came there asking for Carol, she becomes a suspect in the eyes of the local police.Dane is the war hero staying next door while he recovers from a leg injury before going back to his men. His past is a bit of a mystery also, and his meddling in the case is unappreciated by the local police. Carol doesn't know who to trust, and when her brother, a war hero as well, arrives, the mystery becomes murkier.Her snotty sister's car was seen the night of the murder, even though she was supposedly in New York. Was Carol's brother involved somehow? Who has been stealing her mother's fine china from the house? What was the dead girl's relationship to her brother and sister? Dane uses every man and instinct at his disposal to root out the killer and get to the bottom of things. Shots in the night and the mysterious actions of someone unknown, yet moving easily among her Maine neighbors, spell danger for Carol.The mystery is old-fashioned and so is the romance. Dane loves Carol before there is even a kiss. He puts himself in harm's way even though his future is uncertain, not wanting to put Carol through a long wait, and perhaps break her heart once again. This is very much a mystery where you can sense WWII and the changes it made in young men. The mores of a bygone era are in the forefront in this enjoyable and atmospheric mystery from one of the greats in the genre. For those who enjoy their mysteries in this vein, The Yellow Room is a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"That's what Agatha Christie had Hercule Poirot to state in one of her own great cozy murders, \\"The Clocks,\\" (1963). I agree with Agatha, (and with Hercule).Mary Roberts Rinehart was known for her complex plots and surprise endings (\\"Had I but known!\\") and this one is no exception. I also especially enjoy her mysteries because she almost always shifts the focus of the plot on to some edifice, usually a semi-spooky summer home, as the scene of her various cozy murders.In this case, a young woman is murdered and found, partially burned, in the summer home of an aristocratic lady, (the latter being yet another chief feature of Rinehart's stories). At first, the prime suspect appears to be evident but as the story evolves, the reader sees that there are others who might want this mysterious lady out of the way.Mary Roberts Rinehart lived from August 12, 1876 to September 22, 1958. She wrote \\"The Circular Staircase\\" in 1907, a spectacular mystery which launched her to national fame. That work sold over a million copies and is still a good seller today. \\"The Red Lamp\\" (1925) is another of her more compelling mysteries.\\"The Yellow Room\\" was written in 1945 which conveniently allowed Rinehart to produce the most sympathetic of all prime suspects: a military flyer. This is one whodunnit which pretty much stumps even the most ardent of mystery readers in their efforts to anticipate the ending. It's my favorite of all time.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"This is a great old fashion murder mystery, which is my favorite type. It was quick and enjoyable, I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"Mary Roberts Rhinehart never fails to deliver a great story, filled with characters who elicit emotional reactions from her readers. This story is set in the midst of World War II; Carol Spencer's fiance has been reported missing in action, presumed dead, and she's traveling by train with her mother from Manhattan to her sister's house in Newport, RI, and from there to the family's summer home in Maine. When she arrives in Maine with only one servant, she discovers that the staff in Maine is not around for various reasons, and then discovers evidence of murder in the yellow bedroom. Typical of Mrs. Rhinehart, the book takes several twists and turns before reaching its satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"It\`s the middle of World War II. The setting is the Spencer family\`s sumptuous summer house in Maine. Young Carol Spencer has gone ahead of her family to open it up for the season, with a cook and two maids. But nobody meets them at the station. When they finally get to the house, the housekeeper is missing, nothing is ready, and the phones have been pulled out.On top of all this discomfiture, one of the maids finds a body in the linen closet!Two parallel searches for the murderer are soon underway. Floyd, the self-important village chief of police, would enjoy pinning the crime on a member of the wealthy Spencer family. But Jerry Dane, recovering from a war wound in the neighborhood, intends to look deeper. Dane is a mystery man - handsome but unsociable, watched over by a another wounded soldier.Dane is delighted to have a puzzle to unravel while he convalesces. But matters get complicated when he begins to fall in love with Carol Spencer.The convoluted plot is a feast of cover-ups, accidents and misdirected suspicions. Just about everyone seems to carry a gun, and the guns go off rather easily. Everyone smokes incessantly, too. The rapid-fire dialog has flashes of humor.I enjoyed the portrayal of upper-class civilian life during wartime: rich people suffering from the lack of servants, no porters at the train stations, grave shortages of gasoline and gardeners, complaints about rationing and thin cream.Mary Roberts Rinehart has been called the American Agatha Christie. I find her less polished than Christie, and her characters more on the surface. But there's a dashing American quality to her writing that has its own unique appeal. The Yellow Room makes me want to read more of Rinehart. I'd definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"This book is vintage Mary Roberts Rinehart -- upper-class family, grand summer home, all kinds of surprises and plot turns -- with an observant heroine who rises to the occasion and ends up escaping her stifling life as well.

It was a bit slow at the beginning, but it is well worth the time.

I will definitely read more of Mary Roberts Rinehart."},{"Title":"Peter Green: The Authorised Biography","review":"This biography was poorly written and organized, but is still one of the few sources of information and insight into the life and times of the mysterious Peter Green. While almost every book I have read blamed the Munich commune and their LSD on Peter Green's fast departure from \\"our world\\", this book does not take this easy route. This book painted Peter Green as a very complex man with a fragile and sensitive psyche and although drugs may have taken him over the edge, there were other factors that drove him to the edge.A difficult book to find and a difficult book to read, but a must read for anyone who is interested in Peter Green the man and Peter Green, one of the most creative guitarists of all time."},{"Title":"Peter Green: The Authorised Biography","review":"Reading this book was hard work,and pretty irritating to get through. It is written by an Englishman and is strictly for English audiences. Practically every page contains slang, colloquialisms and references to people, places, and things that have no meaning to Americans at all. The writing style is also confusing, going back and forth with the subject at hand so you constantly have to go back to figure out who said what about who when etc. NOT a pleasant read. I am a great Peter Green fan so I muddled through. The author is obviously not a musician either, not very insightful commentary on music or musicians. Lots of anecdotal hero worship, which according to Peter's history and interviews is exactly what he does not want. Hard to believe this is the authorised biography."},{"Title":"Peter Green: The Authorised Biography","review":"Celmins pretty much lays out such facts as he could glean from acquaintances. The dismal story of how the shrinks blew apart Green's nervous system is not told, probably because Celmins couldn't find them or couldn't get them to talk. Celmins does not write the introduction to this third edition, so he may not even be with us anymore (Alan Clayson has the duty now). Well written and a fascinating read because the reader must decide. My take is that Green ran out of ideas prior to leaving the business, and attempted to counter his depression with acid. Once the wise ones administered electro-shock, it was really the end of Green as a composer."},{"Title":"Nursing Assisting: Essentials for Long-Term Care","review":"Am currently using this text to teach a nurse aide training course.

This book gave me a lot more appreciation for Jerry.But, let's not forget that Jerry and Eazy let Ice Cube and Dre go at their prime and those are two of the biggest mistakes in the history of the music business.Heller openly has forgiven Dre, even though his associaton with Suge nearly got Jerry killed. But he hasn't forgiven Ice Cube for the nasty comments and Heller also calls DOC 'a snake' or something like that.This book is great and the best parts are Heller talking about the early days of the group and his details about the making of the Eazy Duz It and Straight Outta Compton albums.Finished this book faster than any book I ever read. It could have been 1000 pages and it wouldn't have been long enough."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"I liked this book but about three pages into the tangent about the non-N.W.A part of his career, I became very bored. After skipping this section, the author returned to his description of his experience with N.W.A and it got interesting again. Decent book, but who cares about the non-N.W.A part of Jerry Heller's career?"},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"I have to admit, that when I first heard that Jerry Heller was writing a book about the Ruthless Records History, I was a little suspicious that the book would have something of a tabloid-esque, payback tonality to it. After all, any of us who followed the Ruthless chronicles in its entirety, knows well the verbal beating that Jerry Heller took after the break-up of NWA. His flogging seemed inevitable since most of Urban America, if not the world, was deeply dissapointed when Ice Cube left the group. So it was easy to jump on the \\"Jerk Jerry\\" band wagon when Cube pointed the finger at him. Then Dre pointed the finger. I even remember hearing the word \\"Draconian\\" being used in regards to the contracts the group shared.Finally, and after a decade, Jerry Heller stands up to tell his side of things. Despite my suspicion, I was impressed to discover that book isn't nearly as bitter as I had anticipated. \\"Memoir\\" is an accurate term used in the books sub-title, as there's an obvious emotional undercurrent about the friendship that existed between Eazy-E and Heller. This friendship, severed by Eazy's death, takes on a documentary voice as Heller takes it all the way to the beginning. First, he gives us a brief account of his own life before he met Eazy. His pre-Eazy story helps underscore just how improbable their \\"dynamic duo\\" alliance really was. It also gives you a glimpse of just how much Jerry Heller evolved from having been in Eazy's company for years. Every good story involves change and evolution from experience and introspection, and that's something of how Heller as a \\"character\\" in this Memoir presents himself.But perhaps what is even more urgent than appreciating the bond between Heller and Eazy is someone FINALLY bringing to the immediate foreground the indisputable importance that was NWA and \\"Straight Outta Compton.\\" Somewhere in the beginning of the book, Heller mentions how Chris Rock noted \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" as the single most important album of all time. I vividly remember when I encountered this same article in Rolling Stones, because I felt a sudden relief that finally someone of significant celebrity had finally taken the Torch that everybody has given \\"The Chronic\\" and handed it to the rightful pioneer project: Straight Outta Compton. Anybody who witnessed the advent of NWA and how it changed the entire social and political climate of America knows what I'm talking about.After NWA controversy became fashionable. Everybody, including Tupac & The Geto Boys, sought out controversey either through more explicitly told ghetto stories, or just plain explicitness and then defended it with the \\"I'm just kicking reality\\" - a signature mantra of NWA. \\"The Chronic\\" was a great album, but it was really just a smoother sequel to what Dre had already started with \\"Straight Outta Compton,\\" and \\"Eazy Duz it.\\"This book finally offers people like me 300+ pages of WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY and HOW descriptions of NWA.Not to be missed are pages 98-100, where Heller gives a tell-all account of Eazy, Dre, Yella and Heller being harrassed by the police while hanging in front of THEIR recording studio during a break. Actually, let me correct myself. Heller stood on the sidelines and protested in awe as the police completely excused him from the routine pat-down administered to the other three. As a black man who has many white friends, I will be the first to say that whites often dismiss and refuse to believe that the police are that selective in singling out young black men. That's what made \\"F--- tha Police\\" such a potent and prophetic song. Heller's story serves to validate it.The book does have a somewhat sour beginning, specifically when Jerry attempts to brand himself with the \\"N\\" word. A move that wasn't so much offensive as it was pretentious. Even if he is as anti-establishment as he claims, turning the \\"N\\" Word into a self-given fashion emblem is a temptation (and embarrassment) he should have avoided.Another unfortunate part of this book, and I'm not sure if this is a reflection on the book or just the reported history of the author, is that you can't help but feel suspicious of how much of the story has been slightly twisted to simply un-do all that has been said in the past about Heller and Eazy. At times, you can sense the indulgence to over-romanticize an obvious \\"Father and Son\\" story, but hey, maybe it really was that way. And if not, I suppose all that matters is that it geuninely seemed that way to Heller.Eitherway, if there is truly two-sides to every story, then here we have at last a little light shed on the alleged \\"darker side\\" that was the backbone of Ruthless Records. If nothing else, Heller is probably one of a small few who make up the short list entitled to tell Eazy's and the Ruthless story."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"The book read like a novel which was interesting for a biography and surprisingly fun. It was not your basic \\"this is where I grew up; this is how great I am, this is what I'm doing now\\" biography. It was a look into two men's (Eazy-E and Jerry Heller) vision and the story of how they turned that vision into reality. It was almost inspiring to see how a 21 year old reputed dope dealer and a 40 year old Jewish man could team up to create one of the most powerful record labels ever and forever change the landscape of music. By far the best part of this book was how well they articulated the craziness that was omnipresent at Ruthless. Beat downs, guns, drugs, full blown war and kidnapping plots were everyday business for these thugs/businessmen/rappers."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"This is definitely a good read for those interested in the legendary Ruthless Records story. However, I feel the book delves way too much into Jerry Heller's '60s and '70s history that is largely irrelevant to the Ruthless saga. The book seems to go very light on details in the post-Dre Ruthless era...perhaps because a lot of those stories could still end up in litigation? Anyway--this is definitely a good read, and there were a few revelations in here that are worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"This book isn't just about Jerry Heller and NWA. The whole book talks about the good side and the bad side of music as well as trying to make it as a business. Regardless of how you may think about Jerry when it comes to NWA, the undertone of the content behind the title is about how the business worked in the 60s and 70s.You probably wouldn't know that Heller's clients included people such as Marvin Gaye, Elton John, Ike & Tina and so on. Heller is not just someone who came out of no where, he probably was responsible for bringing some of the USA's favorite acts.I enjoyed the amusing stories of Jerry and Miami Mike sitting at the table with David Bowie, Eric Wright snatching the ticket book away from the meter maid, Jerry being tricked into learning the top 100 billboard before going to a job interview when it wasn't necessary, Eric and Dre sharing a groupie while asking Jerry to look over the royalty statements, Jerry yelling out the window to his competitor across the street from his office.It really has a great insight into the business world and I would encourage anyone to pick it up if you are wanting to learn more about a history of music. So, go get it!"},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"Jerry Heller&Eric 'Eazy E\\" Wright RIP flipped the whole script of Hip-Hop. forget what you know about Hip-Hop pre NWA Era Hip-Hop because Hip-Hop as we know it mirrors the NWA Era more than anything else.

Loved or Loathed he pulls no punches in this book. he sets the record straight about Ice Cube, Dr.Dre, Suge Knight&Other Musical Figures through his own eyes,ears&overall Opinion. once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. my local Barnes&Noble accidentally put this book out a few days before it was suppose to reach the shelf,but it didn't phase me because I had time to read&I was just reading it. good feedback on the DOC, also Mechell'e the R&B singer who pre-dated alot of what Mary J.Bliege&other artists would do with bridinging the gap of R&B&Hip-Hop. also Heller was Marvin Gaye's Agent. very interesting storys on him&Marvin along with Heller&Elton John amongest other interesting tidbits in here.

The only thing that is \\"off\\" about it, is the slightly weird ending. When we come close to Eazy's death the story abruptly stops and we get a long chapter about the authors past. A lot is left unsaid about the circumstances surrounding Eazy E's death."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"It was a cool book that gave me some insight into what was going on behind the scenes. Most of the stuff about NWA I knew because I was a huge fan. A interesting book the only bad part was about 3 chapters when he slipped in his personal life but I guess he had to let people know about where he came from I skipped over some of that stuff because I didn't really care but I would suggest this book to everyone that was fan of Eazy & NWA & westcoast \\"Gangsta Rap\\""},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer recently printed a lengthy interview with Jerry Heller as a promo to a talk he gave at the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame & Museum on his career in the music industry and to discuss Ruthless: A Memoir.The book gets off to a very choppy beginning, as Heller struts a tough-guy persona that is absolutely silly. He sounds as if he is a rookie pro wrestler trying to psyche himself up for his first match by looking in the mirror & yapping through a monologue that he hopefully will be able to use in the future to get his \\"bad-guy\\" character over with the fans.The extensive chapters on how he met Eazy-E, the rise of West Coast rap, the struggles to get Ruthless Records operating - the racism on the street & in the corporate boardrooms - and the exploding feuds with The D.O.C., Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are interesting. The same can't be said on material covering the implosion of the group and the battles with Suge Knight/Death Row Records; the sections read like the coverage in any number of books/articles.About one-third of the book covers his work in the music industry in the 1960s and 1970s & is more of a narrative of names, places and anecdotes on the famous, near famous and wannabes.It is a quick read and is written in more of a conversational flow. Ruthless: A Memoir has about as many misses as hits, but - in the end - will hold your attention in parts & have you skimming other chapters pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"It is well documented that Heller was the reason Cube and Dre left NWA.

He had records from where money was missing from the label - millions of dollars that he said Jerry was stealing from him.

Anyone who is a fan of Eazy E or NWA DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Ruthless","review":"Jerry Heller aka Mr. Rourke is out to settle a few scores with Suge, Cube and Dre. The read is very laughable when he discredits Cube and Dre's gangsta reputations. My beef is with the way he claims Eazy E as a adopted son and protoge, then towards the end of the book, he discloses some very private information about Eazy's death. I found it disgusting for a person who claims to have had so much love for Eazy to do that."},{"Title":"The Running Target","review":"Note: This book is also published under the title HOME RUN.Author Gerald Seymour's fictional world encompasses the moral, practical, and political grey zones of the conflicts being fought at the world's grittier edges. THE RUNNING TARGET is a masterpiece of his writing.As the book begins, a young Iranian woman, Juliette Eshraq, is publicly hanged to death on a crane in downtown Tabriz by the revolutionary government that had previously overthrown the Shah and executed the girl's father and uncle. The plot then skips forward several years, and Juliette's younger brother, Charlie, who'd escaped to California with his American mother, is now of age and on a mission of vengeance in the Old Country to kill those who murdered the rest of his family. Charlie is secretly run by a senior executive of MI-6, Mattie Furniss, Head of the Iran Desk at Century House, friend of the Eshraq family from his time as Station Officer in Tehran during the Shah's rule, and Charlie's mentor. After carrying out three assassinations, Charlie must now return to Britain to get the expensive, advanced, weaponry needed to finish the job. As Charlie tells Mattie, money is no problem.In the meantime, Lucy Barnes, teenage daughter of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Defense, dies of a heroin overdose in a squalid London flat. In his rage and grief, the Secretary prevails on his friend and government colleague, the Home Secretary, to flog the drug enforcement unit of Customs and Excise to exert maximum effort to find the pusher, distributor, and source. In the course of investigation, it's learned that the heroin is from Iran and brought into England by a man known only as Charlie Persia.As the final piece in the plot's set-up, Furniss is ordered by MI-6's Director General to Iran's periphery to meet with his agents and improve the quality of information coming across. Mattie is code-named \\"Dolphin\\". But, because of a leak in Britain's Bahrain Embassy, Iran's counter-intelligence unit knows Dolphin is coming, and plans accordingly.A major component of THE RUNNING TARGET is a conflict between two agencies of Her Majesty's government in which dedicated and well-meaning civil servants are ground up in the cogs of political maneuvering, and the ostensible \\"bad guy\\" squeezes through the crack. The battle on the home front makes almost irrelevant the machinations and brutality of Iranian counter-intelligence, though, by the end of the book, the reader is left to wonder which side administered the greater damage to our hero, the servants of the Mullahs or those of the Queen.THE RUNNING TARGET is one of the most complex and deliciously constructed of Seymour's many thrillers that I've read to date. Indeed, the reader is thrown a red herring at the beginning as to the identity of the storyline's chief protagonist. In any case, Seymour's forte is blurring the lines between the Good and the Evil; the former doesn't always win, nor does the latter always lose, to the satisfaction of Justice. The victory is usually pyrrhic. The plot resembles real life, and, in that regard, is eminently satisfying."},{"Title":"The Running Target","review":"Writers of espionage novels are inevitably compared to John Le Carr&eacute;, particularly if the writer is British. Gerald Seymour's writing style isn't as polished, and the characters in The Running Target lack the multi-layered depth of Le Carr&eacute;'s best characters, but the plot and pace of The Running Target are worthy of the master.The Running Target begins with the 1982 execution of a teenage girl in Iran. The rest of the novel takes place several years later. Point of view shifts frequently as two storylines unfold. One concerns a drug investigation that follows the death of a 19 year old heroin addict who overdosed. Her father, an important public official, pressures the police to make the heroin importer's arrest their top priority. The cops diligently pursue the task, grumbling all the way. The other story focuses on Matthew (\\"Mattie\\") Furniss, Head of the Iran desk at the SIS, who is being pressured by the new Director General to increase the quality of intelligence coming out of Iran. Fortunately, Furniss has cultivated a new Iranian spy, a family friend who happens to be the brother of the girl who was executed.The Running Target gets off to a conventional start, particularly with the drug investigation, where Seymour employs off-the-shelf drug cops who give the usual tiresome speeches about the evils of illicit substances. The main cop character is filled with anger and moral outrage -- traits that turn out to be necessary to the plot -- but he has the standard fictional cop's \\"driven by duty\\" personality. Seymour provided him with the familiar neglected wife who is no longer tolerant of his \\"job first\\" priorities and is making her displeasure known.Mattie Furniss is a stronger and more interesting character; thankfully his story is at the heart of the novel. At the Director General's insistence, Furniss travels to Turkey to give a pep talk to his agents. Things do not go well for him. Back at home, bureaucrats and politicians are busily abusing their power or wielding it unwisely. There's a fascinating turf war between the self-righteous drug agents, who view the \\"faceless wonders\\" of the SIS as impeding their all-important drug investigation, and the smug SIS officers who view the drug agents as \\"glorified traffic wardens.\\"Both storylines are filled with action and tension. The pace picks up considerably by the novel's midpoint, moving with furious speed as the characters encounter realistic threats in dangerous places. Torture scenes are vivid without going too far.Seymour uses too many comma splices, leading to awkward sentences, but that's a minor gripe. For the most part, the writing is adequate to its purpose, even if the prose doesn't soar. Stylistic lapses quickly become secondary to storylines that captivate the reader's attention.I would enthusiastically recommend The Running Target to most fans of espionage fiction, but it isn't for everyone. If you like novels in which the good guys are pure and the bad guys personify evil, this is not the book for you. There are plenty of evil bad guys, but the three main characters -- Furniss, his Iranian spy, and the drug cop -- each make questionable moral decisions. Seymour's construction of the characters and plot makes it easy to understand why they act as they do. Seymour doesn't judge them; the reader is left to decide whether each character's actions were right or wrong under the circumstances. The answers aren't necessarily clear -- I liked that, but some readers won't appreciate the moral ambiguity. As the novel's end approached, I was drawn into each character's world, fascinated by the choices they made, understanding and sympathizing with them even when I disagreed with their decisions. For all these reasons, I regard The Running Target as one of the most entertaining and thought-provoking spy novels I've encountered. (Note: this novel was published in the UK under the title Home Run)."},{"Title":"The Running Target","review":"Keep running if you are handed this book. Not much between the covers.

Their father asked them to break into someone's home to retrieve a mysterious package. The boys find a way into the house, but almost as quickly as they have entered the house they see car headlights. Soon another set of thieves enter the house. After a tussle with the thieves the Hardy Boys are able to locate the mysterious package in a secret hiding place.Soon the Hardy Boys are in the midst of one of their most dangerous cases. One of the boys is kidnapped. The boys tail a criminal to New York City and are nearly run down in a subway. Later the boys are in a plane that develops serious engine trouble, threatening the boys with death! Even with all the danger the boys face, there is yet more to come when the boys learn what is in the mysterious package and why the crooks want the package.The author seems to be hooked on caves. The caves that appeared in \\"The Shore Road Mystery\\" appear prominently in this book. I think that once crooks find a good set of caves they must pass the location on to their friends.I noticed a couple of rough spots where it appeared the more recent authors who revised the story may have eliminated some prose and struggled to smooth out transitions. I also thought the description of the electronics was a bit weak. Why were the electronics so valuable? Of course, today we expect electronics to be inexpensive. In another update perhaps the author will describe the electronics as the only prototype of a new video game in existence, or something similar.This story moved along briskly, with a lot of action. This story is reasonably well written and held my attention from beginning to end. I think this story is one of the better stories in the series.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"This is the best Hardy Boys book. The excitement never ends. If I could only own one this would be it. They get to do all kinds of cool stuff, meet neat people and even jump out of a crashing plane. And the end eludes to technology available today."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"This is a good story but, it's got some things that annoy me.For one thing, Leslie McFarlane seems to be pandering to his audience here. The \\"innocent horseplay\\" that is so glibly dismissed as youthful hijinks in the first two chapters is only slightly short of criminal behavior and certainly is not what we expect of our heroes or their chums.And how about that party at Chet's for 15 to 17 year olds that goes on until 2 AM, complete with orchestra and in the middle of the greatest economic depression in the country's history?For another thing, Aunt Gertrude is at her obnoxious, overbearing worst in this story. For whatever other faults the villian Chris may have had, one can only admire his audacity for standing up to the old hag. Just once I'd like to see perennial jellyfish Laura Hardy get enough gumption to stand up to Gertie and say something along the lines of \\"Gertrude, you old battle axe, this is my house and these are my boys, so kindly shut up and mind your own business if you wish to continue sponging off us!\\" but, alas, Laura has never said a word.Another odd thing is the complete absence of Fenton, who is out west on a case. Not a word from him or to him, even when Joe is kidnapped! I kept expecting him to show up and somehow tie his current case into the plot but he never did. Instead, those two dopey government agents show up for the climax. It would have been just as easy to tie Fenton into the plot, so why use those two dopes at all?....We also discover another Hardy relative, a \\"Cousin Hattie\\" of Gresham. Just who she is related to is open for speculation but it is Gertie who refers to her as cousin. We also learn the Gertie is 65 years of age, which has to make her Fenton's elder, if not eldest, sister.The one part of the story I particularly enjoyed was the Boys' trip to the city. Their adventures there are plausible and well written. The recounting of their trek back to Bayport (sleeping in Central Park, taking trollies etc.) lends an air of authenticity to the story.Rating: B-Originally reviewed by me in my Bayport Times Issue #21"},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"This review concerns the revised 1967 edition. Mr. Hardy asks Frank and Joe to \\"break into\\" the house of a neighbour and retrieve a secret invention to prevent it from being stolen by a gang of thieves he is currently investigating. Later, at a party at Chet's home, Joe is kidnapped at the stroke of midnight. Frank, along with some friends, must find Joe and learn why he was kidnapped; as well, the Hardy's have to keep the gang from stealing the invention. Personally, I preferred this edition to the original. The original edition was better written; although, that is true in most cases. However, I found that revised edition had a more interesting mystery and it had a lot more action. I don't consider this book to be one of the best of the series, but it is far from being one of the worst."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight? (Hardy Boys, Book 10)","review":"Hi guys!

At the stroke of midnight, Joe is kidnapped from a party at the Morton farm and Frank and his chums set out, not only to find Joe, but to discover why he was kidnapped. I'd more accurately give the book a rating of 3.5 stars. The writing, like with all previous volumes, is excellent and the mystery is alright, but the book doesn't quite live up to the intriguing title. Mr. Hardy does not make an appearance in the book as he is said to be on a case out West and, in my opinion, his omission only hurts the story. Most readers would probably not rate this book as one of their favorites in the set, but they probably wouldn't rate it as one of their least favorites either."},{"Title":"What Happened at Midnight?

My mother was the assistant manager and I was the hostess. One afternoon, my mother and I went to a diner for lunch. Our waitress, Debbie, was so sweet that we took an immediate liking to her, and my mother offered her a job at my uncle's restaurant on the spot. Debbie accepted.We invited her to our home for dinner that evening and during our conversations with her, we learned that she had never married and that she had no boyfriend. She told us that five years before while on a flight back east, she met \\"her pilot\\" and that it was love at first sight.She was very nervous as she was boarding the plane and the pilot was standing in the doorway greeting passengers. He must have noticed how afraid of flying she seemed, and he struck up a conversation with her. They spoke less than ten minutes, and he assured her he would fly her safely to her destination. She told us it was \\"love at first sight,\\" and we told her there was no such thing. Although she never saw her pilot again, she never forgot the feeling she had in her heart when their eyes met.Mother and I had a plan. Since she was so in love with her pilot, we decided to fix her up with one of the many single pilots that came into the restaurant to eat in between flights. We approached John, one of the pilots, and told him about Debbie. He agreed to meet her for a dinner date on one of his nights off.We sat him at a nice table with candlelight and fresh flowers. When Debbie arrived, we walked her to the table to introduce her to her date. As we approached, Debbie stopped dead in her tracks, tears welled up in her eyes, her hand went to her heart, and though I couldn't believe what I was hearing, she said, \\"My pilot, it's my pilot!\\" He stood dumb struck and embraced her.We later learned that he, too, had fallen in love with \\"his passenger\\" five years ago on that flight back east.The last we heard from Debbie was in a letter from Guam. When people tell me there is no such thing as love at first sight, I tell them this story and show them the photo Debbie enclosed with her letter, a photo of her family, her husband, John, in his pilot's uniform and their two beautiful daughters."},{"Title":"Chocolate for a Woman's Spirit: 77 Stories of Inspiration to Life Your Heart and Sooth Your Soul","review":"Just wonderful!

It was not compelling, but I did want to know how Grace would deal with her issues so I stuck it out to the end. Only a three star read."},{"Title":"The Puzzle Bark Tree","review":"Since childhood, a dream has haunted Grace Hammond Barnett. Only after her parent's suicide does Grace realize that her dream is actually a repressed memory and a key to forgotten past. She and her sister Melanie had always know their parents were different than other parents -- little more than vague shadows that passed through their lives restricting music and laughter with their dark presence. Only the housekeeper Jemma filled the girl's need for fun and frivolity, for hugs and unquestionable love.The free spirited Grace grows up to marry a man as emotionally barren as her parents. Over the years, her bohemian skirts and long silver earrings cease to suit this highly respected cardiac surgeon. Ironic really, that a man who heals hearts refuses to touch the emotions of his own or another. Even with the death of Grace's parents, Adam refuses to accompany her to the scene when the call comes. But his absence leaves room for extraordinary change when Grace learns of the clues that lead to the answer of her parent's silence and the secrets that will forever redefine her life.Author Stephanie Gertler displays a dazzling skill for charting the transformations of the heart in THE PUZZLE BARK TREE. Grace's parents become a powerful presence in the novel, ironically through their absences and odd restraint. Gertler skillfully captures Grace's mother's devastated psyche with powerful imagery and gentle understanding, never excusing her withdrawal yet treating it with compassion. Indeed, the women of the novel sparkle with a shimmering passion and presence, though the men are so strongly juxtaposed as to become stereotypes. Nevertheless, Gertler's flowing narrative weaves a mesmerizing tale of sorrow, transformation and healing. Moreover, Gertler's distinctive rich voice speaks with incredible sensitivity and wisdom. A beautifully realized puzzle comprised of the past and the future, of grief and of joy, THE PUZZLE TREE comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Puzzle Bark Tree","review":"As children, sisters Grace and Melanie never felt close to their parents, who for whatever reason never blanketed the siblings with nurturing love. Now as an adult with her own child, Grace feels her marriage mirrors that of her parents though she showers love on her cherished daughter Kate. Suffering from a recurring nightmare of drowning, Grace believes she has no one to turn to for help especially her parents and her husband.When her parents suddenly die in a tragedy, Grace inherits their Canterbury Island home in New York. Surprising everyone, Grace decides to spend New Year's at the house rather than her annual time with family members. There Grace looks into her family history guided by local fisherman Luke Keegan, who will help her with her past and perhaps attain a loving future if she heeds Melanie's advice.THE PUZZLE BARK TREE is an engaging character study that ties the shrouded past with an unhappy present in a finding one's true self story line. The tale turns overly emotional at times, but the audience will devour all that angst as Grace seeks contentment learning a life lesson of \\"to thine own self be true\\". Fans of insightful contemporary fiction will want to join Grace on her journey to Nirvana that Stephanie Gertler portrays so eloquently.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Puzzle Bark Tree","review":"Stephanie Gertler's title &quot;The Puzzle Bark Tree&quot; is symbolism but you'll have to read far into the book to find the metaphor in a tree trunk.

He's very good at repairing strangers' hearts, but excels at breaking his wife's.Stephanie Gertler writes simply and easily in short chapters that glide you along page after page, then suddenly stop you with a 'wow' event you'll want to stop and digest.Of course there's a happy ending. Your ride to it is by reckless roller coaster of steep hills to climb, low valleys to cruise. At the end of the ride, you move on, embracing the future and The Puzzle Bark Tree."},{"Title":"The Puzzle Bark Tree","review":"Stephanie Gertler has written an interesting, engaging novel about family secrets and finding oneself despite them. Grace and Melanie are sisters who truly compliment one another. I found myself wanting to read this every spare moment to find out what would happen next. I must confess that the story line was somewhat simplistic and I longed for something unpredictable to happen. That was not Stephanie's style and although I would have liked a surprise, the story still held my interest. I highly recommend this book. I believe you will find it one of those books you just can't put down. Thank you Stephanie for giving me another wonderful read!"},{"Title":"The Puzzle Bark Tree","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is (with my apologies to the author), the book is pretty formula. If you read Nora Roberts or people like her, you pretty much know where the book is going and what will happen along the way. That said....I really liked this book anyway. There was just something that grabbed me right away, and I read the book in a couple of days, I didn't want to put it down. I really liked the characters, and I got so involved with them. I cried at one point so hard, my family came running to see what was wrong!Read this book and enjoy it, I know I did!"},{"Title":"The Boy and the Gunfighter","review":"This western \\"good guy, bad guy\\" novel is a fun, easy read. Suitable for young readers (most likely boys) or adults. Knight has a straightforward but engaging plot with a couple minor sub-plot lines. Dialogue is enjoyable and he creates characters that have quite a bit of depth given the short length of the book. Never soupy or melodramatic.By way of disclosure, I knew the author many years ago when he was a music professor at a university in the Southeast. He even mentioned that he aspired to move back to Colorado, where he grew up, and become a western author. He lives in Colorado and has published several novels, so I'm glad to see he followed his dream."},{"Title":"The Boy and the Gunfighter","review":"While I may be (as an adult) a bit beyond the intended age range for this book (I think it's considered a 'juvenile novel') I still liked it. It's the story of a young man who comes out from the East to find that his family has been the victim of foul play, and he engages a locally-known gunfighter to help him extract justice from the perpetrators. The gunfighter is a character himself, not keen on the young man or of having him around. It's an easy read, an interesting story, and if you like something a little off-beat in Western fiction, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Reiser + Umemoto: Recent Projects (Architectural Monographs: Academy Editions)","review":"Maybe one architect made a favor to another architect, and they convinced another academic architect, who had some say with a famous publisher, to publish the book with not much of substance (kind of the Emperor's New Clothes tale), but graphically excellent on beautiful paper using very good technology and printing dyes?"},{"Title":"The Wedding Deception (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"In this story, Claire our heroine meets a man who is visiting her county and develops a great friendship with him, he sees that she is in danger because the town squire as set his eyes on her and is determined to have her by all cost, so Jay offers Claire the protection of his name.After they marry He tells her he is going on a journey but warns her never to visit his home without letting him know first.Due to some unseen circumstances, she is forced to go to \\"Jay's\\" manor but what to her horror she finds that the man that looks so much like her Jay doesn't seem to be Jay and is vehemently denying ever being married to her.It turns out that she did marry Jay,(the mischievous twin) but \\"J\\" signed his identical twin brother's name Jasper on the marriage certificate.Jasper cannot turn this woman away, but he is already bethroted to be married to someone else. He is determined to see if this union his brother made on his behalf is legal in the meantime what his is to do with his \\"wife\\"The plot is simple enough, but in a tragic twist the other woman who Jasper was engaged to got caught up with the evil Village Squire.....All in all it was a very enjoyable read, some parts were a little to dark for my taste but fortunately it doesn't take too much away from the love story to ruin it."},{"Title":"The Wedding Deception (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"To avoid the advances of a villainous local squire, Miss Claire Barrington enters into a marriage of convenience. The groom, however, signs his twin brother Jasper's name to the marriage documents. As Claire and Jasper sort out the legalities of their situation and their feelings for one another, the evil squire and other malicious characters plot against them.There is a rape scene in this book. And the rapist doesn't die a horrible, excruciating death at the end. I think the author needs to rewrite that. Or maybe editors will keep rape scenes out of style and leave them out of romances all together, please."},{"Title":"The Wedding Deception (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Adrienne Basso, was fast becoming my favorite author until this book. It was riddled with a plot that was so predictable and worse of all bad. She took two women who were abused by their father and turn them into women to be hated. She showed no compassion towards her characters and their pain. This book has not even been donated to goodwill but has been thrown away where it belongs in the garbage"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Who would've thought that Jenna's story could have a happy ending. I hope to hear more from her and how current events have impacted her business."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Without a shadow of a doubt, Jenna Jameson is one of the cockiest, most self-centered &#34;celebrities&#34; known to Hollywood. Although I read this book cover-to-cover, and was no doubt entertained, I take everything this woman says with a grain of salt. Jameson is just one in a sea of many, many abused and neglected strippers-turned-porn-stars...and she is hardly legendary. Since the book was published, she divorced the loving husband (her second, I believe) she speaks so highly of throughout the book. In fact, some of her photos are dated and down right cheesy.I promise you--I am not writing this review because I am jealous or angry that one woman has found fame and success. More power to her! It is refreshing to see a young woman make it in an industry that is notorious for chewing up young women and spitting them out. As a young woman myself, I am inspired by Jenna's passion, drive, and savvy business sense.But this book is cheesy. Everyone has a tale of woe, everyone has an abusive past, and everyone has a sob story. Jenna Jameson claims to be something so special and unique, but judging from the pictures in the book, she just looks like another run-of-the-mill porn star with huge implants and fake lips.This book is definitely worth the time to read, it's just not worth the money to purchase. Check it out from the library instead."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Lots of interesting stories of the working of the porn business but it does drag on in certain points. Lots of jumping from story to story. Hoping there would be more juicy celebrity tidbits but more of her life story instead."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Her life story. The title might fool you, but once I got into it I thought it interesting how she grew up to do and be who she is."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was a great read. Jenna Jameson is a fascinating woman who makes no apologies for the decisions she's made or the life she leads. I hope she writes another book that talks about her life after retiring from the porn industry and becoming a mother."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna's story and the way she tells it is amazing. Five starts without a doubt, but the book has some flaws:The diary transcriptions are really hard to read in a Kindle 3. Also, in the middle of the book there are long conversations between adult Jenna, her brother and her father; those are quite boring and cut the book in half.The other negative thing is that the book only covers her life until 2004 (i'm not sure about the year) and the thing is that many important things have happened in her life since then. It should need an update."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"An entertaining look inside this industry. Jenna is very open and has been through good and bad times and came out alive."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Interesting story and insight into how the heck someone ends up doing porn. Still not finished reading but so far so good."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Book starts off great, an easy and interesting read. Then seems to deteriorate as if Jemma ran out of material. Tons of dialogues that makes no sense at all."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I loved this book. It truly makes you understand what Jenna came from to make her what she is today. It was like an epiphany."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I don't remember tips on how to make love like a porn star, but I do remember this book detailing Jenna's life's journey. Her adolescent years may have been dysfunctional, but her teenage years were the real mess. She got into trouble with boys b/c of sexy clothes and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She got into drugs, she dated the wrong men, she made poor career choices...or did she. After reading her book you realize this young woman may have gone through a whole hell of a lot but she's actually quite strong and smart enough to recognize an opportunity staring her in the face...like running her own porn empire. It's a big book with loads of color pictures and excerpts from her journals that will keep you engaged for hours. Oh Jenna."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is an amazing book to read. Jenna Jameson went through a rough life. I really would encourage people to read it!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I have to admit that I did not expect much from this book, however, I was proven wrong. It's easily read and very hard to put down. Jenna is very honest and raw as she takes you down her path of becoming a porn star. Jenna led a life that most of us cannot imagine, however, she endured in her own way. I highly recommend this book, however, the sex is very raw and detailed. Not sure if I would share the book with my mother."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. The story is so contemporary, so vividly told, and so lurid, the effect is like a literary car accident you will NOT be able to turn away from. My advise is to take this book on a good vacation where you will have time to be obsessed with it, controlled by it, and completely mesmerized by the incredible tale. Also by the same \\"writer\\" of the book, Neil Strauss'THE GAME is another must read for the beach vacationer."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This autobiography of a porn star/stripper is profusely illustrated with many photos of the author in revealing poses that do not uphold the Christian values our country believes in.Jenna, you are a naughty girl and need to be spanked!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Any one who is interested in buying this book better have alot of free time on their hands. I say this because once you start to read this book, you won't be able to put it back down until you reach the very last page. \\"how to...\\" is an autobiography of Jenna Jameson, with out boring you she tells the story of her life and career in great detail , but also grabs your attention by at least one picure for every two pages.... I'd recomend this book to anyone who loves her, as well as any one who may not even had heard of the wonderfull woman who is Jenna Jameson."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"A story of being the best, not necessarily the best at something that most of us would want to do, but the best at her business. It's not really a how-to book (though it has a few short guides), it's her autobiography. It was a rough life. Left home early, no education, raped, abused, addicted to drugs she could well have been one of our total outcasts. Instead, through stunning beauty combined with an excellent set of brains, she has defined herself at the top of the porn movie business.You don't normally associate porn stars with brains, but they sure come through in this book. Her 10 Thou Shalt Not's for men rank right up there for best humor. And she has taken her position in the movies as a start to forming her own production company and then set herself up as the CEO of ClubJenna, Inc., a video production, licensing, internet development and management firm for more than a dozen adust stars. Dummies don't do these things.The sub-title of the book is \\"A Cautionary Tale.\\" And cautionary it is. This is certainly not the life you'd want your daughter to live. But it's certainly fascinating being a voyeur on the side. Glad she made it, glad she wrote it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"As a (...) man who does not watch Jenna's movies, I read this book with a different perspective. I was not looking for a tittilating read but really wanted to find out it is like behind the scenes in the porno biz. Ms. Jameson lays it all out here in this vouyeristic treasure chest! She tells all from early childhood, through some rough years that bring her into the porno biz, to her huge success as a mega sex star. This is not the Great American novel but it is part of the American Story (Like it or not all you prudes!). I would not say it is any great prose, but Ms. Jameson's voice carries the book in an honest manner."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is by far one of the best written, most entertaining memoirs I have ever read. Jenna is a unique force in the entertainment business, and she paired up with the best of the best (rock biography writer Neil Strauss, who also architected the Motley Crue bio masterpiece The Dirt) to deliver a winning tour de force through the adult entertainment industry. Jameson and Strauss never stick to a typical narrative, choosing instead to tell entire chapters via comic strips or checklists or other funky means. The photography, dozens of gorgeous pictures in high-gloss, is alone enough reason to justify the purchase price of this book.I'll admit that I've never even seen a Jenna Jameson movie, but I love reading about the lives of interesting people, and Jenna doesn't disappoint. She has both suffered and triumphed during her career, and she bares everything in this amazing tale. She also dishes plenty of celebrity dirt! Jenna is no apologist, and she's proud of her life, which makes for refreshing, scintillating, and downright delicious armchair reading."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I was not expecting much from this book, but somehow found myself getting to the end of it in no time. The story is interesting, there is surprisingly little sex (though ex post is seems logical given that for Jenna, sex is mostly work), the tone in which it is told is very honest with no lies and no trying to look better than reality, all in all this is good entertainment.Tough to decide whether Jenna is actually smarter than many would have thought (could be the case), or whether it is just that her stories were put together by a smart writer.Not, of course, one of those wonderful biographies of a wonderfully impressive person, one of those books that one must have read (such as Ralph Freedman's biography of Nobel Prize holder Hermann Hesse, \\"Pilgrim of Crisis\\"). But good, wholesome entertainment."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I read a bunch of reviews here, and it seems like people hate Jenna for what she does. Personally, I'm not a porn watcher. And I don't think it's art. But this is a good story. And it's unapologetic, which is why people with sticks up their butts have trouble with it. The scary thing is that most women can relate to it. She is eerily Everywoman. But what do I know? I'm a guy, and I like the pictures. No, actually I like the cartoons. It's a really clever book, and I've never read a biography like it. I doubt some of the haters have even read it..."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Obviously from the other reviews, I am in the minority but I absolutely did not like this book. It was a let down. For months, I have been hearing about this book and the end result wasn't worth the anticipation. And it definitely isn't worth the 28 dollars to buy it!The book is a let down in several areas. First, there isn't a lot of celebrity gossip nor are there a lot of tips on \\"how to make love like a porn star\\"..nothing really juicy or dirty which is why most of us wanted to buy the book in the first place.Secondly, we are treated to over 500 pages of appalling stories regarding her childhood, her addictions and her abusive past relationships and then in the last thirty pages of so, she falls in love with her husband, and everything is now fine and dandy. We aren't told how this amazing transformation comes about. The Jenna at the end of the story might be interesting but we don't ever learn who she is. There is big void at the end that leaves the readers with a lot of questions.And lastly, perhaps it is me but I think it is absolutely bizarre that this woman, who is the number one porn star in the world, never uses the proper anatomical words for penis, clitoris and vagina. Instead she refers to her genitals as her \\"ding ding\\" (?????????)Why the baby talk?? Makes me wonder if this woman doesn't have some seriously unresolved issues regarding her body and her sexuality. Anyway, when it comes down to it, I would wait until the paperback comes out or look for it in the mark down bin. In my opinion, its not worth the asking price.DenaP.S. The pics are nice but you can find hundreds of the same pics on the internet."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is one of those books that are just impossible to put down. From the first few pages to the very end you are just hooked. Obviously Jenna Jameson is no Ernest Hemingway, but she sure lead one heck of an interesting life that makes for a very interesting read. As you read this book its more like one of your best friends telling you a story. I highly recommend this book as a weekend read."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Don't let the title fool you. I knew prior to buying this book that is was going to be about her life but I expected her to give more details about the industry itself. If you want to learn what really goes on behind the scenes this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Honest depiction of the sex industry, but very depressing. Basically this book outlines the reasons that I stopped going to strip clubs many years ago: Sad people who view their customers with contempt. This should be required reading for every adult male at the age of 16 years old."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I remember hearing about Jenna Jameson in August 2004, shortly after she published her book. I didn't have the chance to read this book until I finally picked it up in March 2010.Firstly, I must say that Jameson seemed very confused about what she wanted this book to be. What does the writing really mean to her and her fanbase? Is it an autobiography? A book for fun? A memoir? Descriptions I've found on Google aren't clear, and she smartly avoids the chore of introducing her paperwork as such, either.The title of \\"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star\\" makes me believe that it is a manual one could use for romantic relationships and in the bedroom. \\"A Cautionary Tale\\" seems as though the book would be about her past regrets and how to urge others against it, while expressing her own dangers and reliefs. Let me just say, the book was neither of those.Jameson's book starts off very promising, by explaining the death of her mother before she went to kindergarten, and how she was raped at the age of sixteen. The book sounds decent and interesting enough at this point. As a matter of fact, I'd say it was even good. We cruise through her years of high school in Montana and Las Vegas, and follow her as she racks up her first stripping job, which she credits for having led her to her infamous porn career to begin with.The rest of the book was quite a blur. We accompany Jameson as she takes us through her first photoshoots and adult films, but chapters and chapters are used up for her own stories out of pure vanity, such as how she would make jokes with other porn stars or newcomers backstage, a question column devoted purely to herself, and both friendship and romantic relationship drama. There is nothing in here to learn from or gain, fans or not.Her book is written very poorly, and how she really \\"made\\" it is not clearly described. She seems to jump around many events and milestones without clearly showing any sort of realistic emotions. She claims to have been raped twice in high school, dealt with a friend's death and another's pregnancy, and briefly mentions regret over not having been there for her dying grandmother, but still seems to have glamorized everything in her telling. Therefore, we don't have any sort of window or sympathy into Jameson's world.I'm still not sure who I would recommend such a book to. True porn lovers and celebrity lovers would want something more intimate, either for themselves or from the famous figure. Jameson tried her best and some stories in here are very interesting, but do not seem very believable or significant as far as terms of the entire book goes."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I think my expectations got in the way of my enjoying this book. Jenna Jameson is the ultimate adult actress, and she is also the consumate business woman. In addition to her looks, she is intelligent, otherwise she would not have risen to the top of the adult industry. So I had hoped to read about how she conquered the industry and rose to the top. There is some of that, to be sure, but the lion's share of the book is how she bounced from one bad relationship to another, always self-destructing and falling back in to some sort of addiction. I expected some of that, but it's pretty much the entire book. I actually ended up feeling really bad for her, even at the end with her new found happiness and new husband and all her success. (Knowing that the second marriage she wrote so fondly of at the end of the book ended in divorce after publication didn't help much, either).On the bright side, there are a lot of extras in the book that I didn't expect, such as the cartoons and the diary entries. There are also a lot of photographs which certainly add to the overall value of the book.After reading Christy Canyon's book and Ron Jeremy's book, I guess I expected something a bit more positive. Canyon and Jeremy put a human side on pornography, and I expected the same out of Jameson. But after the drugs and bad relationships, there wasn't much time for that."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna's life began with a whopper of a tragedy that shattered her family and set her on a road to near ruin. From the vantage point of this event, and except for degrees, her life is not much different from many other lives where a child loses a one parent at an early age, and then the other parent to depression. Many readers, especially women, will be able to empathize with her story and situation, even though on the surface they may reject her lifestyle. Jenna raises herself - she has to learn a lot of lessons on her own with no one to show her how. One is amazed at her gutsiness of going to High School while working as a stripper after she left home. As she spreads her wings ( and legs) and grows up - things take a lot of turns. Along the way she encounters a cast of characters out of a b-grade movie - or a porn set. There is Preacher, whose DNA should be given to every jurisdiction in the United States to match for unsolved crimes. There is a small town in Montana whose criminal cases need to be reexamined. ( The irony here..did her dad take her to the small town to get her away from Vegas?? ) There is Howard Stern's essential humanity. And there is the ever present sea of sex and the bisexual Jenna tells some tales here of horny stars - from Bruce Willis to Cindy Crawford to Tommie Lee. ( Really, does Jenna think Bruce and Cindy did NOT know who she was? ) Why she got cut from E! Jenna has a lot of ambition, but she also tempers it with hardheaded realism - and many will find this refreshing. Better yet, the careful reader will notice things she left out or which were cut from the book. (And one wonders why.) Like, who is her therapist? The shrink must be the world's greatest! Has Jenna had an abortion? Has the IRS ever audited her? Other things dont ring true - like her Dad's war stories. And why did he move around a lot? Overall, I could not put the book down. I cringed at her mistakes, laughed hard every few pages, admired her guts, and found the insider details fascinating. I look forward to a real, full biography in the future, but for now, this will do. I recommend taking this book on a cross-country flight - and leave the sexy dust jacket on it!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I originally bought this book thinking it would be sex tips. When I got it and started reading, I realized it was an autobiography. And, wow, thank god for that. It was a great surprise. The story begins with the image of a gorgeous stripper hanging from her shower, dead. And from there, it doesn't let up. However, the tips are still there. There's some amazing insight into the porn business. All the girls in the business like to pretend like it's all sex and glamour and they love it, but this is the truth. Most revealing was the section on how to become a male porn star: I had no idea. There are short comic books throughout the book that are really high-quality and funny (especially the suitcase pimp one). And Jenna's story is really dark and triumphant: My wife is reading it now, believe it or not."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"At first I was skeptical about reading a book by a porn star. When I began reading, I found that it was very well written and the story is unbelievable; it is something that you will not read anywhere else. Her story is scary and amazing. She overcomes so many obstacles in her life. For example, there is one full chapter about her battle with drugs and a play by play writing technique that she uses. She grabs the reader so well and keeps them in. I read this book in a couple of sittings. And i read the last 150 pages after I finished my last final, and it was more satisfying than finishing some of the hardest finals of my life. You must read this book. It is an eye opening experience and I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? I didn't get this book because I'm a huge, die-hard, obsessed fan of Jenna (although I do think she's great!), I was more interested in reading about someone living/working in an area so far removed from the mainstream: namely the porn industry. Yet in the end she becomes the leading lady of adult entertainment and thus becomes a mainstream icon! This book was EXTREMELY well written from beginning to end. It has some brutally honest accounts from Jenna's childhood and growing up in a dysfunctional family, to how she ran away from home and got into exotic dancing, nude modelling, and eventually X-rated movies. It writes about all the hardships she had to face, incl. drug abuse, personal problems, family crises, etc. She also gives some good advice for those that wish to work in the field. It has some juicy, Hollywood-esque type stories involving high profile celebrities as well. Some chapters are very steamy (& shouldn't be read in public!). This book gives us a good overview of what type of person Jenna must really be. This was one of the most entertaining, introspective and interesting books I've ever read! Oh, yes, and the numerous pictures throughout the book are an added bonus. If the whole notion of a porn star's autobiography doesn't offend you, then I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"this book pulls no punches.

Fascinating story written naturally."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was the best book I've ever read. It opened my eyes to many points of view, even I, a fairly liberal person, hadn't considered. This is a story of a woman, overcoming so much, and not using any of it as an excuse. She does what she knows best, even if its not what society views as moral. Jenna Jameson is a sweet, (innocent, yes, innocent), kind, woman. She shows how the porn industry can try and use you, but how she used it to her advantage, kept her limits, and came out on the top.(no pun intended.) Check this book out if you like true life stories and seeing people from new perspectives. I read this book in a day it was so amazing. I lent it to 5 friends, and in 3 weeks we had all read it and fell in love. I can't wait to get the videos!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"The story begins with stripper hanging from her shower, dead.

Perhaps fans would get more of it (I have not seen any of her films). For someone looking for material on the inner experience of porn, this book is better to the (virtually useless) The Other Hollywood or Sunset Thomas' Anatomy of an Adult Film but substantially inferior to Carly Milne's Naked Ambition. Jameson does come across as an assertive and interesting person, making the most out of disempowering conditions."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Just like anybody else, I had my own certain perspective on the person that is Jenna Jameson, based solely on her claim to fame: being a porn star. But, being the open minded individual i am, I found the title and cover intriguing, so i bought it off ebay and began reading. By the time you finish the first chapter, you know that this is a book that will bring up many feelings in you, and that it will be a story of tragedy, joy, downfall, inexperience, fame and success. Throughout the book you will feel for her, hate her, ask how could she be so stupid, want to give her a hug and congratulate her for everything. Jenna's sincerity is almost unbelievable. She lets herself be seen \\"more naked than she's ever allowed herself to be seen.\\" She tells everything with a no-holds-barred attitude, from what she was feeling when she was addicted to drugs, to her view of men, to her extremely close relationship to her brother. After you finish the book, you truly feel that you are one of Jenna's friends, and you know everything about her. From a tragic childhood, to an abusive romance that lasted many years, to drug abuse and loneliness, this book has its share of sadness and unfortunate events. However, Jenna is a witty, intelligent and hard-working woman, and she gets through every experience as a true warrior, always learning from her mistakes. The only insincere thing in the book is the reasons he gives as to why she decided to do porn. Jenna started stripping to make fast and easy money, and she started doing nude photoshoots of a sexual nature soon after that. She stated that she got into porn \\"to get back at her boyfriend\\" who was cheating on her at the time. Other than that, it is a book that you will enjoy. There are plenty of nude pictures of Jenna, though they only show her breasts. There are also many sexual encounters explained in detail, and two rape scenes. The book also explains some interesting things, such as health problems that strippers encounter, how to make it in the porn business, as well as a couple of cartoons and a plethera of pictures. Overall, this book keeps it as real as possible, and it is so superbly written. Jenna is such a genuine human being, one that you will fall in love with and want to know even more about. This book wil enthrall you and it will definitely become one of your favorite memoirs, if not one of your favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I bought this book at 1 PM yesterday, I sat in my bed reading it off and on, all day long till 12AM. I just couldn't put it down. Its a big, thick hardcover book. Everything about her was so interesting from her family life, to the men she had chosen. She's really just a fascinating person. The book has a lot of pictures which is awesome. Normally, you make up in your mind what her dad and brother look like, but she had pictures of them and some of her friends. I wanted to see what Jack and Preacher looked like. I never read, ever. Unless its Cosmo or some other trashy magazine. I shocked everyone when I wouldn't go out that night because I'd rather read her book. Her life is full of heartbreak, but like a fairytale, she does live happily ever after in Arizona with her love, Jay. And those two people, I wouldn't mind being sandwiched in between them! She tells about how Nicholas Cage smells bad, how obsessive Tommy Lee was (go figure) and the weird humor Marilyn Manson has (go figure) if you aren't reading this book, you are truly missing out. I wish she does a movie about her life. I now see Jenna as a beautiful girl inside and out, not just a Porn Star."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"When I first got this book, it was a gag from a friend. Then I started reading & could not put the book down. All I knew about Jenna Jameson is that she is a adult film star. Now I know that she is one of the most powerful woman in porn & she got there by not laying on her back & spreading her legs, but by using her head."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"First off, this book is a lot of fun. The cowriter is Neil Strauss, who also co-wrote the Motley Crue book \\"The Dirt.\\" Both books are packed with all the juicy sex, drugs, and rock n' roll, without being watered down by TV decency standards.The only reason I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because it hits a wall around page 200. Up until then, it's a racing story of Jenna's descent into addiction and entrance into porn. But at page 200, we get WAY too much information about her sad childhood with a distant, endlessly name-dropping single father. Zzzz. (Isn't it also kind of kinky to have sultry nude pics of Jenna interspersed with her childhood photos throughout the book??)Up until that point though, the book rocks. I have wondered what makes a woman go into porn, and always assumed that it came about from putting money over relationships, much like prostitutes. (See \\"Brothel\\" by Alexa Albert for a behind-the-scenes look.) But this book presents Jenna as not only a calculating sex diva, but also a real person who had to struggle with a background of drugs and biker gangs. Howard Stern always assumes that porn stars were sexually abused as children, and when young Jenna is raped by a biker overlord named Preacher, you go \\"Hmmm.\\"That said, I'm not so sure that this book really is a \\"cautionary tale.\\" Jenna had tough times, but look at her now-- a multimillionaire in a seemingly stable marriage with her (admittedly very effeminate) husband Jay. Whether or not it was \\"worth it\\" depends on your own moral calculus, but there's no denying that it looks like a hell of a ride!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I have to admit I have never watched a porn film in my life and I probably never will; nevertheless, I could not put this book down and read it in three days. Jenna Jameson's tale is so real and honest that you are hooked after after the first page. Her story is definetly a cautionary tale and you can learn so much from her experiences. You may think that this is just some dumb blond who made her way to the topof the porn industry by just her looks, but there are thousands of women out there more beautiful and sexy than Jenna Jameson who aren't successful in this business. Jenna Jameson made her way to the top not only by her intrigueness, but also by using her head. Many do not respect this profession and I can honestly say I would never do it, but through Jameson's mistakes and experiences you can learn a lot about what not to do. I loved this book because of the honesty and emotion that Jenna pours into her words. Excellent and beautifully written."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"You won't find any hot tips on how to make love. You won't find titillating sections about the lives of porn stars. This fascinating book is about something else. It is about and by an extraordinary woman who overcame innumerable and very painful obstacles to achieve stability and happiness in a rather unconventional vocation. Jenna is beautiful, of course. And you better believe it: Jenna is smart, supersmart. But most of all Jenna is strong, tough, incredibly resilient. Very few people could have gone through the trials that she endured and come out intact. She did, and she eventually found peace and love in her chosen life. She chose this life because it fitted her talents, her enormous talent for sex, her love of bodies and physical contact, and also her considerable talent as an entertainer and actress.The book is extremely well put together. The general plan is very creative. The writing is excellent. And the numerous photos are wonderful, especially the black-and-whites which are less formal, more intimate than the colored ones. There are two juxtaposed full-page photos of Jenna and her mother, both gorgeous, very touching. Quite a few delightful, natural photos of teenager Jenna. Many terrific shots of Jenna's face in various moods. Many photos of her with the various friends mentioned in the text. Many pages of her diary, probably not authentic, but fun nevertheless. I found it hard to put the book down. I reread many parts several times. This book could have been an excellent novel. And yes, she had a co-author, Neil Strauss, who is well-known for his great writing. More power to her: when she needed help she went and got the best. Neil had an essential job to do: in Jenna's words, he \\"broke down all those walls that had been standing for so long.\\" But she is the one who told him the story, all parts of it, including those that made her look really bad, and there are plenty of them. The story sounds totally real. And very human! It is an extraordinary, most unusual, gripping, beautiful book.Then there are the boobs. The book is full of boobs, or course. Should I talk about her boobs? The first porn movie I ever saw was Blue Movie, whose making she describes in the book in some detail. This movie is very dated now, but I still think that it is the funniest porn movie ever made, and I still watch it sometimes for that reason. Not that there are many funny porn movies. There are very few; the two genres don't mix well. Anyway, Blue Movie was also my first introduction to Jenna, who has a prominent part in it. I realized immediately that this woman possessed considerable acting talent, an impression that was confirmed after I had watched many of her other movies. Good acting is rare in porn. But those boobs of hers! They were displayed prominently in the first scene and I was horrified. How could this obviously intelligent woman possibly think that her good looks were being improved by these superheavy, formless, viscous, dead weights? Well, I found their story in the book. They are her \\"Dr. Canada boobs\\", the result of her first boob job at the age of twenty, which she admits had been a big mistake. Her friend Nikki Tyler's boobs, though much better than Jenna's, were also a mistake; it took me a long time to get used to them. A few years later Jenna had a second boob job, this time by Dr. Garth, who improved things a lot. The truth is, and Jenna knows it, that there was nothing wrong with her original boobs, which you can admire in her many teenage pictures: they were large, natural-looking, perfect.The title says it, this book is A Cautionary Tale: the porn movie industry is not for every girl! I think that the general public does not need to be told that. They are more likeky to think that this industry is a cesspool of body fluids, rape, and exploitation. Jenna got where she is by making every possible mistake under the sun and learning from them all. But only someone with Jenna's strength can do it that way -- don't try it! Of course there are other ways, but at a minimum one should have a lot of talent. From what I can see, not every man in the industry is a sex-maniac, a liar, and an exploiter of women. There are some very good people also and Jenna mentions quite a few of them. They are there because they enjoy the work and it is a decent (sic!) living. But this is sex after all, and sex attracts a lot of sick crazies. It behooves one to be prudent.Before I stop, here is an interesting fact about the porn movie industry that Jenna explains very well: the female stars and the male stars receive completely different treatment and have completely different lifestyles. A good female star actually has a lot of power; she decides what she does and what she does not do; she makes only a few movies per year; and she gets paid a lot of money. Most of them stay in the business only a few years, after which they tend to take up a more conventional life, possibly getting married and having children. A good male star works a lot more and is paid a lot less. He does not have a wife or girlfriend on the side because no woman wants a relationship with a man whose job consists in screwing other women all day long. As a result, male stars stay in the business forever. They are highly experienced and their job is to show off the woman and to stay mostly out of the way. They form an elite group whose size is limited by the size of the industry and it is very difficult for a new man to break in."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"How to make love like a Porn star is a very very cool book, I mean maybe I shouldn't reading this book, as I am slightly young but screw it, I have slept with about 5 girls now and man I still love porn.

Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy - the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. Her childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.

Jenna has truly lived a thousand lifetimes, and has succeeded where many have failed or died. This story is not just a cautionary tale, but a survivor's tale. She is a survivor of multiple rapes, horrific beatings, drug addiction, her mother's untimely death, and a broken family. She does admit that she has two sides to her, and that she still continues to battle her inner demons. I personally know people who work in the adult film industry. Some of them see Jenna as a rude ice queen who married a creep, while others see her as one of the kindest, most motherly girls in the industry. No matter how you see her you can't deny that she is a survivor. Nor can you deny that she is very brave to willingly pour out her darkest secrets to the world. She is a true inspiration to women, victims of rape, people with drug addictions, and victims of domestic violence"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"When I first saw this book, my reaction was to laugh and ask my roommate why she had wasted her money on a piece of trash like this.

The book details Jameson's life as a stripper in Vegas and then her work in the adult industry. She wrote a lot from \`behind-the-scenes', with her early stage as a stripper trying to outstrip the other girls, to the business executive she has now become.I enjoyed reading the book because I realised just how stunted my audience-oriented perspective was of stripping and porn stars and just how much hard work it is for them. Despite this, I was also reassured that there are some who participate in this and do actually enjoy the work for what creativity and innovation it can sometimes offer!Sometimes I could sense that Jameson was tucking the reader under her wing, to impart her experiences and understanding. And in a union-starved industry, like many others such as the retail sector where I work, this could be a useful book for those who may be considering working in this field. I found the use of various formats refreshing, from her diary/journal entries to the illustrated pages revealing some of the occupation health hazards a stripper can experience (of course, in graphic novel format). This was insightful."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I read and loved Neil Strauss's bio. on Motley Crue (and I'm not even a fan). Strauss has the gift of helping underbelly celebs speak in a voice that is naturally theirs, without dumbing them down. I am thoroughly enjoying this book. Jenna will be the first true crossover star in entertainment and this is almost like a historical document covering the first phase of her career. She certainly doesn't make it look easy, but she has a certain gritty elan that captivates at times."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"It seems that porn has become a glorified medium in society today. While it was once a shameful, back alley thing is now big business. Where once it was a shameful secret from the past if someone uncovers nude photos or video of you from years ago and publishes them, it now only boasts your image or career. Even if you're some nobody, you can show what a rebel you are by appearing in something homemade smut film because you're a \\"Bad Girl\\" (or a \\"Bad Boy\\" for that matter). Porn has gone Hollywood.Jenna Jamieson was just another bad girl. She was already a troubled child by the time she met with her first terrifying sexual assault. Like a lot of adult film stars, Jenna descended from there into an abyss of drugs, sex and abuse. Many adult film stars report at later dates being physically forced, held against their will, or kept under the influence of drugs and alcohol to preform before the cameras. They keep returning to this world, however, because they are ashamed or addicted. Jenna admits herself that she just wanted to be loved, and she ended up being used and abused by these big and little time operators.This is not a glamorous world, not by any means. It is a vicious cycle of sex, drugs and terrible things beyond any stretch of the imagination. And yet, Jenna emerged from the dregs of society not as a reformed addict or even a \\"nice, normal person\\", but a celebrity. Instead of going to a new town, changing her name, and restarting her life afresh (as no doubt a lot others have who used to be in this business), Jenna took her status as a porn star and carries it like a banner. She's more famous than she was at her lowest point. Her attitude is \\"I'm dealing with what I've been dealt\\".Hmmm... Well, I guess we should be proud that she's done something with herself rather than become a statistic. But she continues to glamorize the porn industry with her currant image. Well yes, you might say, it's her right to do so. And yes, it certainly is her right as well as anyone else's right to live as they choose, but she is still pushing to glorify an ideal out of something sordid. Pornography is not about free speech, it's about commerce. Jenna Jamieson might be trying to warn others about the dangers of this industry, but she is still selling a line of products to make money for herself.Read this book as a means of learning what not to do. Be thankful to your parents for interfering and keeping you on the strait and narrow. And most important of all, know that you can be a Bad Girl on your own time and you don't have to live vicariously through others to be one."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson is a household name of porn industry. In this book she is more naked than any of the films she performed in, letting reader behind the scenes on how did she end up to such unusual position. Jenna's story is humane and after reading it you will probably never see adult entertainment business the same way you did before. Her book is partially ironic, at times funny and capturing story of a woman who survived through what so many women before and after have failed to survive.

I always thought porn is an industry about sex, because I never considered it a business. Money rules every aspect from dancing to stripping to modeling to acting. Just one of dozens of things you've taught me in this book, Jenna.I used to think porn girls are dumb as a bag of hair. Understanding what they must know to survive, and how they must navigate their careers, has opened my eyes and given me newfound respect.On the other hand, any man who actually buys into the fantasy surrounding porn after reading this book is truly a dummy who deserves to be fleeced unmercifully by these ladies.Jenna, you give great read!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"No one should judge Jenna!

I am very happy for her that she has found Jay, someone who loves her unconditionally. I hope that Jenna gets her lifelong dream to have a baby. I know she will be a great mother and that child will have everything she never had in her life: a mother figure, a stable father, and unconditional love.

She was just straight forward and totally honest about everything, she admits her mistakes and doesn't apoligize, but yet understands what she did wrong and learns from her mistakes. Her story story telling was honest and the way she came up w/pic's of the people she was talking about in the book really helped out to understand who she was talking about. Most bio's don't come with pic's and comic book edits to help make the reader understand. This is the best Biography I have ever read in my life.

However, after reading this bloated bloviator (over 500 pages for this person?) I came away with no respect for Jenna Jameson. The book is actually well-written obviously by Neil Strauss as Jenna is a complete and utter moron. The uneeded information about her loser of a father and brother only added to the length of this book. I'll sum it up for you. Dumb teen girl gets hooked up with a tattoo artist and in order to impress him decided to strip at a club in Vegas. After \\"studying\\" the art of stripping she met her goal of being the #1 stripper at the club! Go girl! Dumb teen is now also using drugs and posing for magazines all the while thinking that she is a \\"star.\\" Eventually she ends up in LA and working in porn vids. Of course, what else could a dumb, uneducated loser do but strip and or do porn? Now, her goal is even loftier - to become the biggest porn star on earth! Wow! What a goal! Finally, dumb girl uses her body (obviously not her brains) to make it to the top of the dung heap of porn. I mean, I love Ron Jeremy, but he's at the top of the game too so what does that say about this bimbo? Of course, dumb girl is also a huge egomaniac and thinks that her adult work can translate into the mainstream - yeah right. A very brief stint doing some interviews for the \\"E\\" Channel is all her mainstream career amounts to. Eventually, after several failed marriages she marries some other loser who works in the biz too. And, that about wraps up her life - completely meaningless! There are so many other people worthy of a book on their lives than this trailer park idiot that it made me sad after reading this. This dumb blonde has done nothing except have sex on film and she equates herself with empowering women and has the biggest sense of entitlement of anyone. Now, as she is over 30 she's just a used up, bitter ex-porn star that will never go mainstream. Sorry sister but you ain't no Julia Roberts - hell you aren't even Richard Roberts. Overall this was a mildy interesting book filled with too much filler but it makes the \\"author\\" (not the brilliant Neil Strauss) come across as a sad [...] clown.

Osama, you may have your suicide bombs and your fanatical followers, but we have best-selling biographies of women whose claim to fame is solely based on their ability to handle hundreds of penises without smudging their mascara. You may send out videotapes taunting our inability to catch or stop you, but we have DVD libraries full of oxygen thief beehatches like Jenna Jameson, whose sole talent is being able to look seductively into a camera while being saturated in others' bodily fluids. Osama: you may think you're going to destroy this proud nation. But we're going to beat you to it.The book? Well, Jenna was raped. And like ALL women who have been raped, she turned to meth, porn, and letting 300 lb. carpet salesmen and drunk frat boys shove one dollar bills in her buttcrack. Totally a triumph of the human spirit, man. And I totally like how Amazon's own review says the book ends on a \\"family values\\" kinda theme. I guess spending the better part of a decade coated in reproductive fluid must make you want to actually reproduce! Who knew, right?

Although the book is long (almost 600 pages), it contains many glossy pictures, comic strips and notes from Jenna's own calendars and planners.The autobiography does not follow a conventional (birth-present) time, it jumps from age to age, career feat to professional victory and everything in between.I rate it five stars because it is undoubtedly the most honest and cathartic book I've read about someone's life."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Not much knew here with this book, but the point is well put, and Jenna Jameson should be given the credit for being what I call, the \\"Elvis Presley of the Porn industry.\\""},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS BOOK,AND SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT-I CAN'T NARROW IT DOWN.EVER SINCE SHE WAS A TEENAGER,SHE'S WORKED SO HARD TO GET TO WHERE SHE IS TODAY.SHE DID EVERYTHING ON HER OWN.SHE'S HER OWN PERSON.HER LIFE FROM CHILDHOOD TIL NOW IS VERY EXCITING,AND INTERESTING!SHE TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MEN IN HER LIFE THAT SHE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH.SHE TALKS ABOUT HER FRIENDS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK.SHE TALKS ABOUT HER FEELINGS ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS.THERE ARE PAGES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK THAT SHE'S IN THE COMICS.THEY'RE VERY UNIQUE!THE PICTURES IN THIS BOOK ARE SO VIVID!THE PICTURE OF HER AND HER MOM IS SO SPECIAL!THEY LOOK SO MUCHALIKE!JENNA DOESN'T TAKE HER FAME,AND FANS FOR GRANTED.I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE IS,AND HOW FAMOUS SHE IS-THAT SHE'S NOT A STUCK UP,OR THAT SHE DOESN'T SAY TO HECK WITH EVERYBODY.SHE'S SUCH A SPIRITUAL,THANKFUL,AND APPRECIATIVE PERSON OF EVERYTHING SHE HAS,AND OF ALL HER FANS.DEFINITELY GET THIS BOOK!I CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS HOW GREAT THIS BOOK IS,AND HOW GREAT JENNA IS!JENNA HAD ALOT OF HARDSHIPS IN HER LIFE IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS-BUT NO MATTER WHAT,SHE DID WHAT IT TOOK TO GET TO WHERE SHE IS TODAY."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was put together well and I really enjoyed thestory..the author told the story with flair...this bookreally held my attention.

Prostitutes are prostitutes, no matter what they may call themselves.

SHe was 30 when this book came out and it's amazing all the things she went through. She shows us her transformation, worts and all from a meth addict, boyfriend addict, victim, diva, and finally, just a regular all-American girl wishing for a happy family. I liked this book and like Jenna even more after reading it. Her husband Jay also sounds like a good guy. You can't help but be happy for them by the end of the book. A great summer read!There are some parts that don't hold up under scrutiny, however.1. She talks about groping in a restaurant at the Venician Hotel in Vegas in 1994 but I'm almost positive it wasn't open then.2. Her father claims to have killed 61 Vietnamese soldiers with an M1 and Thompson sub-machine gun, in 1959 (?)--year is never specified. That sort of action would get you the Congressional Medal of Honor. Veterans, feel free to chime in as I never served in the arm forces.3. She horrifically details her abuse by men and claims she became stronger and vowed to not be a victim. Great, except that type of abuse requires years of therapy to get through. I think she is still in denail or substituting that kind of pain for something else. Shrinks, please weigh in.4. Earlier in the book she says upon first meeting Howard Stern she was impressed that he was such a family guy and really loved his wife. But later on, on the set of Private Parts, she considered having sex with him. Was she really ready to risk breaking up his marriage for the sake of a \\"nooner.\\""},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"i abosultely love this book. towards the end of the book she gives really good details on certain sexual positions to add 'spice' to sex.

I sasw Jenna's e true hollywood story, and got intersted in her. this book makes the E story seem like nothign in comparison. it's a real page turner. i couldnt put it down. kind of like a crack pipe (just kidding). and i am not a big reader. i could see it as a movie when i read it, especially the first parts in las vegas with the insane bikers and meth smoekers. and then the diaries were amazing because you learened all about how she developed sexually. and yo ugot to meet her family, whch may explain how she ended up doing what she did. and then along the way, there's smo much about how the pron business works. and it's not necessarily glamorosu. the offcamera sex scenes here are the best. i'm not into girls, but after reading some of this...never mind..."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"The redeeming qualities that this book DOES have, and there are not many, only owes to the fact that Neil Strauss helped pen it. I doubt Ms. Jameson can put two sentences together. If you want to read a book that consists of a lowly porn star whining about her life and how other people did her wrong, then this is the book for you. She doesn't ever fess up that the life she leads now happened by her own doing. Grow up, Jenna. You won't achieve mainstream celebrity, and 'mainstream celebrity' wouldn't even be considered unreachable anymore if you were to actually make it there. The book is filled with pictures of the self-serving Jenna, so if you are a beer-guzzling male who enjoys staring at women of only average looks, you hit the jackpot. Her early pictures versus her current pictures suggests she has had a lot of work done, as her face looks totally different. Still, I wouldn't say the change is something to behold. We are talking about a porn star, after all."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This was the first time getting a book on line and it was as exactly as advertised.I wish I had paid a little more for shipping so it would have come faster but it was about a month before Xmas so that probably had a lot to do with it.

She gave me the \\"you can talk to me if you want to look\\"! Maybe because I look sort of like her husband, Jay, only older and not quite as buff(saw him too at Gold's Gym-unless some other dude got a very big Jenna tatoo).You see a few attracive women here in Vegas on occasion, but really, I'm not rich, famous or even ambitious, so I usually think to myself; why bother-where's this gonna go anyway? So I mind my own business.It was only a minute or so later that this guy butts up through the line and starts the badgering. He didn't stop till she was leaving the store, this is after 11:00 pm and the store is almost empty!So if your wondering what does(or doesn't) go on inside the head of a pretty starlet, first consider what your life would be like if EVERY other person you meet, male or female, would likely go out of their way to have sex with you!

After following her carrer a little bit via Howard Stern on E! and even VH1's documentary and book release \\"promo\\" I am totally impressed with Jenna as a business woman.

This book truly wasn't meant to be a means of \\"cautioning\\" readers about the perils of the sex industry. What is being offered here though, is a copious amount of icing for the depraved ego of a (...) acctress who is trying to add meaning to, by way of discrediting, her chosen path in life. It is quite apparent to anyone with a rationalized process of thought, that the (fictionalized) insanity in Jenna's life is a self serving venture. It creates intrigue, then the intrique give birth to fame, and the fame helps to build Jenna's cash pile and ego stock. Geee Jeanna, what an ingenious marketing idea at the expense of the soul!!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book is the definitly one of the best books I've ever read.

I would really recommend this book to anyone, your going to be in for a couple of shocks! Very Recommened!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I desperately wanted to like and appreciate this novel. I've heard wonderful things about Jenna Jameson, and while I'm not all that interested in porn [sorry], I thought maybe this book would be insightful. Also, I typically love biographies, so I figured why not add it to my collection?Unfortunately, this was one of those books that I had a very easy time putting down, time and time again. It was not well written [and I assume that she did not do most of the writing], it was not engaging, and all it did was make Jameson sound highly self-absorbed and insecure.Not once on any page did she take responsibility for any of her actions, instead putting the blame for her life on her childhood and lack of a mother figure, and the lack of her father being around. Nothing bothers me more than a person who can't take responsibility, especially when the yearn so much to believe that they are an adult. While yes, we all make mistakes, the best thing to do is admit to it.The things that happened to her were horrible, although it's very hard to believe everything that she had written. Example: How can you simply forget being raped as a teenager? Especially when in the book it is described in great detail.I know a lot of people really enjoyed the book [I believe mostly because we all expected anything that came from her to be drivel], and while it wasn't horribly written, I don't think by any means if she were not in porn, and if the book didn't include an array of color and black and white pictures, this would not have been a best-seller by any means.It's sad that I considered her a stronger woman BEFORE I read this, as opposed to after."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I was so excited to finally get started on this book. Even though the size initially threw me off (600 pages), it was suprisingly a fast read. I read it faster than I've read a lot of shorter books. That should let you in on how interesting it is, I didn't want to put it down.She pours her heart and soul into this book and I don't mean that to be cheesy. She lets you in on every detail of her life and how she felt about it and just drags you into her messed up life. I'm not a huge porn fan but I have always been intrigued by Ms. Jameson. She's so beautiful.The only semi-bad thing I can say about this book is that she says the phrase 'to this day' entirely too much. It's not so much bad, just annoying.....or funny.Read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This has got to be the best autobiographey I have ever read. Jenna Jameson has had quite the life and she deserves every good thing that comes her way. She has evolved from a stripper to a model to a porn star and now to a great writer. Hurray to Ms. Jameson."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I thought it was amazing the way she wrote this book, it led me to continue reading non stop. She hooked me right in the begining and never let go. I always anticipated what crazy thing would happen to her next. I loved it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"There probably isn't a man in America, including those religious figures, who hasn't seen Jenna in action. Those who haven't either are blind, lived in Mars, or lived in those monastaries where there are no TV, movies, candy, women, or anything else worth living for. But I bet they have still heard of Jenna's name because she is so famous.Jenna' gives a somewhat candid glimpse of her messed up life, and it is a big mess. I have a feeling it is even bigger mess than what appears in the book. After all, who would let 6 billion people know about all the trash that went on in her life? Having said this, there are plenty of trash in the book that makes you go woo and ahh over the details of her sex life and the porn industry. If you like National Enquirer, you will love this book. If you loved Jerry Spinger, then this book will continue where he left off. If you like porn and want to become a porn star, Jenna gives some excellent advice and insights into the porn industry."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I believe that this book was written well. I do think Jenna is an amazing person, but I must admit I never hear of her until i saw this book. Thanks Jenna for the stories."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was truly excellent. I read this book in about 3 days. Jenna was very open and honest about her past. She is who she is. Although, this book was interesting and entertaining, it was also very depressing at times. Jenna has led a very difficult life, and although, many would find the porn industry to be immoral, this is where Jenna has made her home. After reading this book, I think most would think differently about female porn stars. Most live sad, unhappy lives. I'm actually glad for Jenna, she was able to capitalize on an industry that uses women. I think the biggest myth about female porn stars is they are rich, although this book doesn't go into great detail about salaries, porn stars are paid dirt,[...]Jenna Jameson and a few others are an exception."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Impressive to say the least! A wonderful book written with the verve of James Joyce or T. S. Eliot, the text incorporates philosophical thought that would make Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus proud.The numerous photos are worthy of Walker Evans at his best!Having said that, this stripper-porn star has been an EXTREMELY naughty girl and I volunteer to do the spanking."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is a perfect holiday book, but once you've read it once, you'll be itching to read it again. It's one of the most honest celebrity biographies I've read in a long time, and even though I'm a chick, I have to say I wouldn't kick Jenna out of bed! Sh&eacute;'d probably kick me out though.What attracted me first to this book, was obviously the cover. I had it on my wishlist at Amazon for quite a while, and hunting around for a decent enough price, before giving it and getting it to read on holiday. Well, I finished it within a couple of days, and probably could have finished it faster if I'd tried! The whole book is totally addictive, and you're left wondering what will happen to Jenna - believe me, she ends the book on a real cliffhanger! Jenna, whenever you're ready to write a sequel ...The photos in this are absolutely gorgeous, and it seems Jenna is a forerunner, when it comes to certain looks. Christina Aguilera & British glamour model, Jordan (owner of 32FFs) both look like they've taken Jenna's look & tried to pass it off as their own. Why, Christina could easily be mistaken for Jenna on the cover of this book - even though that particular look is more of a Marilyn Monroe look than anything. And the pictures inside - WOW. Jenna is a force to be reckoned with, cos she looks gorgeous. Not sure about her hubby but whatever does it for you! Although on the cover of the book, it does say it's uncensored, however, it is not. Certain photos of Jenna have been censored, but there's not many if you're now crying into your keyboard.Jenna is honest about everything in her life, from her loves (men & women, the dirty minx), drugs, alcohol, family, everything you can think about. It's really refreshing, and I highly recommend you read this. Just keep it away from your boyfriend if you're female, cos he won't be able to keep his tongue in his head. I'll definitely be reading this one again & again, and maybe trying out some of the looks for myself."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"If you read books to be entertained then I recommend this book. If you have a religious or conservative agenda, you're not likely to like this book. Therefore, you have a disparity of opinion in reviews. I do not watch porn movies and have only seen her on Howard Stern or E! TV. Sometimes she is attractive and sometimes I find her to be overrated. But she projects a friendly, engaging personality that I think draws people to her.This is an autobiography which may confuse some people by the title. But there are touches of \\"How to Make Love Like at Porn Star\\". Specifically, the testimonial from the unidentified male porn star. Not a picture of a glamorous life but well worth the read.But in the end this is an autobiography of a young girl who gets in with the wrong crowd and by 16 she is stripping and living with a much older tattoo artist with a serious meth addiction. Jenna is good at her craft and quickly moves from dancer to model to porn performer and along the way develops relationship and drug problems. For people who do not like strippers/porn stars, you'll see all the stereotypes that you expect.It's interesting to hear her tell her story with her point of view. Is she always right? Of course not. Can she be a very tough witch that you wouldn't want to be around? Absolutely. But at the end of the day, she's developed a great career in her chosen field and is making a lot of money. AND, she's written a very entertaining book."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I enjoyed the book. Even though it has lots of pages to read, it reads fast. I am sure Jenna's story is not unique, she made a lot of mistakes in her life, mainly hanging with the wrong people. I believe her bad choices were consequences of her awful childhood, even though she keeps saying that's not how it is. She made a statement that she was not a victim, or she never wanted to sound like one, it seems like that's exactly what she was.Her life was a disaster, even when she became famous. Drugs and bad relationships were ruining her life. Fortunately, there is a happy ending!I felt relieved and very happy for her at the end.The book is just Jenna's autobioraphy, but reveals the truth about the strip clubs and there is something to learn for the girls who work there. Besides, there are simple tips anyone can learn from her mistakes: stay away from drugs, save your money, even if you earn lots of it, don't let anyone disrespect you, do not stay in bad relationship and be caring and forgiving with your family.Also there is certainly a message for people who want to be in porn films: there is too much to sacrifice for money and it might not be worth it..."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Well, what can you say about this book? It is the autobiography of a porn star. It's practically review proof. It's not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, but nobody who reads it will be expecting a literary classic. Most people who read it will be looking for \\"dirt\\" on the porn industry and the various celebrities Jenna has met. And there is plenty of that. But the book also has this disclaimer: \\"Only some names and identifying features of individuals have been changed in order to preserve their anonymity and protect their innocence. In addition, some characters are composites, and one movie title has been changed.\\" I believe that the changed movie's title is \\"Cherry Pie\\", which is called \\"Sponge Cake\\" in the book. But what I really want to know is: which characters are composites? Anyway, if you are at all interested in what goes on behind the scenes in the porno industry, this book is a real eye opener."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I could not help but feel somewhat depressed after reading this book. I found her life story to mirror what I have always thought a porn stars life would be - sad and empty. As much fame and attention Jenna craves, in the whole scheme of things, she has few people who truly love and care for her. All the so-called \\"Stars\\" and every day people she meets only want one thing from her and it is not her pleasant personality. She was and still is being degraded and looked down upon, yet she tries to expound upon how she did things her own way in the porn world. Dignity and respect are two things lacking in Jenna's life. How sad."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Possibly the worst thing a person can do is lie to themselves. Tricking others is bad, but tricking yourself is 100 times worse. Ms. Jameson is deceived and a deceiver.Ms. Jameson was a neglected child who has never yet distanced herself from libertine, idiotic narcissism enough to reckon with the overall impact of porn on America. 600 pages but not a shred of objective wisdom, just Jenna Jenna Jenna.Without her looks, she absolutely would not be taken seriously by anyone. Sadly, her lunatic push to take more porn (and herself) mainstream show an iresponsibility she may never overcome.American porn is full of deceptive images that can lead to severe errors in expectations and judgement about sex, espcially for developing young minds. \\"Love Line\\" is a sex commentary show (Dr. Drew and Adam) which repeatedly warns people how they must not believe a lot of what they may have seen in porn films, particularly regarding anal sex and multiple partner sex (gang bangs).I actually favor legalizing prostitution, letting it be what it would be-a needed release for frustrated guys. But I wouldn't call it making love.And I hope to God that noone picks up Ms. Jameson's self-obsessive dark autobiography expecting to learn anything about making love. It's subtitled \\"a cautionary tale,\\" but I would catiion you not to waste your money.Jameson is a whore, which I actually think she has a right to be. She just needs to own up to it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Jenna has a wonderful talent for being totally honest about her life while at the same time conveying the lessons she's learned with wisdom and maturity. She also talks a lot about relationships and just how hard they can be and when you really love someone just how much you have to put up with, and sometimes (when it comes to relationships) just when you should walk away.Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal. I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality. As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.This is definitely the kind of book you could read over again and still gain new insight, not to mention all the beautiful photographs."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"The cover and title of this book could be a turn-off for some, but it really is a GREAT book and a great auto-biography. Jenna describes her life from her childhood to the near present. Her life was filled with sexual abuse, drug abuse, alcholism and of course the adult entertainment industry. You can't help but like Jenna after her candid and entertaining book.Jenna has made porn almost mainstream. She is THE most famous porn star and she has made a huge living from it. This book will make you respect Jenna and although you may not agree with some of the choices she made, you will like her."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book would have to be my all time favorite book. It was so interesting and I could not put it down. I knew before I bought it that it wasn't all about porn and Jenna Jameson having sex, but of her life, struggles, and how she got through all the hard times.Her life story somewhat reminds me of mine, only opposite my dad was not around and my mom was all I had. When she talks about having the same dreams over and over again, it really scared me because I have those same dreams. My favorite part of the book was when Jenna worked at the strip club crazy horse 2. It was so interesting and continually filled with more and more shocking moments every other line. What she went through in there was terrible, even though it was her own choice. I never realized it was so serious and it's an actual business.But in the end Jenna got through everything and it only made her stronger to be the women she is today. She is happily married now and i'm glad that everything worked out for her."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Perhaps I expected much too much from Ms. Jameson, but I was a tad disappointed after reading her book.I was initially interested in her portrayal of herself; as a business woman, as an individual. I felt that she didn't describe herself as either of these, and instead relied too heavily on the mundane, average occurances and habits that she has in common with too many other Americans.I thought that there was soo much attention paid to her drug use and abuse, and not enough attention paid to her ability and drive to overcome life's challenges.She came off not as the intelligent, sexy, strong, business-savvy gal I had thought she was; but as an average girl who came upon her current place in life simply by chance. I think that I actually lost some respect for her because of her book, instead of gaining any."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"How to make love like a porn star is an awesome book!

I felt like I was listening to an old friend speak about her life. In essence, while the content was interesting, the writing was not breath taking or anything special.

I'm sure this part appeals to people who are really into the porn film industry or something, but for me it was just like reading name after name of people I had never heard of.

I did not expect sex advises in it, because other readers have mentioned there arent any there. However I was expecting something more hot as a reading in terms of more insight of her job and so... If we follow the book we get the idea she has hardly slept with a few carefully selected men(and women) and also have done a few movies, which is not the case. I even found it at some moments quite boring to read how she gets hooked on a guy, alcohol or drugs(sometimes together) and cant let go... it could be just my feeling, but it is that i feel something fake in this book and it was interesting to read how she started and what her life in general was, i just couldnt feel this book as an impressive one.."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"A good book overall. Was surprised to learn a lot about Jenna Jamison. Seems that she doesn't hold anything back."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Anyone who enjoys sex would probably love this book. It's always been odd to me that so many are quick to judge strippers and porn stars. Although I've never fit into either category, I found that Jenna and I share many of the same experiences of our troubled past. You may find that you identify with her, have nothing in common with her, envy her or hate her. But, at least you're likely to admire her willingness to &#34;lay it all out on the table&#34;. She shares very personal rape experiences, details of her drug abuse and addiction and the traumatic loss of her mother. She does all of this in a way that somehow still makes you laugh...without feeling guilty about it.Most people have wondered at some point what it would be like to be the person that others fantasize about. This book gives a very detailed description of Jenna's role as the object of both men's and women's fantasies. She balances the erotic details very well with the painful reality of what that lifestyle can sometimes bring (addictions, constantly being judged by others, trouble maintaining relationships, etc.). All in all....this is a great read that's honest, sexy and funny. Loved it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"One of the best biographies I have read without being smutty.

I'm sure the tips will come in handy also."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I have heard that some of the stories in this book are either false or exaggerated. I can forgive that because it is such an enjoyable book! Jenna's tale has all of the drama and excitement of a movie. Her tales about run-ins with celebrities and her time in the adult industry are very fun. This book is filled with the kind of stuff we want to read.And just in case you have forgotten what she looks like, the book is full of pictures, some fully nude. A welcome bonus that should please the fans. Buy this book and display it proudly on your coffee table. It will be a great ice breaker when the in-laws come by."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is an honest account of a really difficult struggle. There is also enough intelligence and hope in the author so that the idea of something better arriving is always present. I would love to read her account of the same story in 10 years -- I can see her writing this on a completely different level at that point, and having it be equally or even more interesting. I hope this doesn't offend, but on one level the book reminds me of the Autobiography of Malcolm X. She's coming from a place of so much oppression (personal/familial, class, gender), anger, and abuse, and moves herself through it in stages, and she works hard at this. There's not an equivalent transformation here (although it's not possible to actually compare), but there's enough to inspire. The extreme loneliness she had to endure and the dangerous things she did in spite of her intelligence show the power of oppression and abuse to recycle its victims through generations. Her story is inspiring because of her awareness, intelligence, and constant pushing for strength and health. It would have been nice to hear her current thinking about her experiences in the context of her new family/children, and to hear her talk about her history and how it related to her choices, but a lot of this is in the subtext."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"wow i started reading this and finished it a few days later. her story is sad, shocking, happy, lost, and everything in between. props to her for sharing her amazing tale. a must read, not for faint at heart though, its very explicit!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is another book I just could not put down.

It's a mixture of humor and drama.There are lots of pictures in the book to chronical her life; the ones with any kind of nudity are blurred out.I've read it twice now and found that it was just as interesting the second time around.

I wanted her to be different than the stereotypical problem child turned porn star, but she isn't. As much as she talks tough in interviews this book is proof that she is just a victim.Bottom line, if you're a fan of Jenna already, then buy this book.

I couldn't put it down. It kept my attention from start to finish, which is rare. Im not a big reader, but it pulled me in. It is basically Jenna Jameson's biography.

With genuine authors abound, I suppose it is quite easy to be drawn into a book like this, but just sit and think about it for a minute. I'm going to give money to someone who's only claim to fame is being a drug-addled adult film slave? Is this really important or pertinent to our lives in any salvageable way? Why do we want to know about this filth, just because there's a glossy cover on it and the chance of nudity? Aren't we as humans deserving of so much more.

No wonder she's gone places! Jenna can do anything she puts her mind to. I mean that; if she decided tomorrow to go to medical school, I have no doubt that she would emerge from her residency in 6 years, ready to perform brain surgery. Or at least plastic surgery. The point is that she is much much more than two big juicy knobs and a hot lovin' caboose. This lady ain't a tramp; she's the perfect woman."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"First, allow me to say that I love porn and porn stars, but this biography really does not offer anything new to the reader. If you've read biographies of other porn starlets then you won't find too much that's different here.After 100 pages, I got pretty sick of Jenna's bravado and constant whinning about not being loved or getting attention and so on. She never really grows up, but sickingly relies on the one thing that keeps getting her in trouble---that fabulous body and great looks.Someone once said that strippers and porn stars are a bit unstable and now I believe it! But, I always keep reading in the hopes that I'll really find a truly smart and savy porn star without all the \\"baggage\\".In this book, Jenna does do a good job of presenting her wacky life in various formats and she gives some surface tips about the business, but it's stuff that anyone with half a brain would conclude in less than 5 minutes of being anywhere near this business!After reading this book, I didn't come away from it with any more sympathy or interest in Jenna. She seems vapid, silly and immature in the beginning and in the end of the book. Gee, now I wish porn stars would just shut-up and perform!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"First of all, i have nothing against the porn industry, or the people who have made a living off of it and made millions! That's the life they choose and if they have it, i say flaunt it...but don't act as if there's an \\"art\\" and \\"complexity\\" to being a stripper and a porn star, and pretty much sugarcoating the whole industry and acting as if it's some form of empowerment and independence (for women). I mean c'mon, compared to being a doctor, or any other career that you actually have to work for with your brains, being a porn star or stripper is just the easiest way out of the higher spectrum of respectful living. That's one of the many things that irked me about this book. First of all, I don't understand what point there was to write a book about somebody's life by somebody who doesn't even take the effort to make it sound the least bit interesting and insightful, and honest. Never does Jenna seem to admit that at least some of her pain and suffering came from the life she chose, and her own choices. Nobody pointed a gun at her face and told her to become a porn star, SHE chose that career.There are other ways to make millions out of beauty, without using one's brain (and i find it hilarious that Jenna proclaims that it was her \\"brains\\" that got her this far to dominate the porn business...PUH-LEEZ! Who gave a crap about her brain...it's the PORN INDUSTRY for pete's sake!). I just think Jenna has gone a bit too far with still trying to milk her past porn success for as long as she can by writing a pointless book about stuff that could have been talked about on E True Hollywood story. Didn't need to necessarily write a whole book about it. If Jenna wasn't so conceited and didnt have such a big ego about herself, then maybe i would respect the girl more. But that's the thing, she still acts like a girl. GROW UP JENNA! She needs to face it, even if you are the world's biggest porn star, the \\"legacy\\" can only go so far. No porn star ever has or ever will go \\"mainstream\\" beyond the first career path they chose in the first place. What's the book industry coming to nowadays? If this one girl can write a whole book about taking drugs, stripping, having sex on film, and whining and complaining about her life without having the least bit of thought about how her actions affected her faults, mistakes, pain, etc., then what the heck, why can't other people do the same just as easily?"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Like Hugh Hefner, Jameson is a hypocrite. When Hefner went ballistic at Bill Buckley Jr.'s suggestion he proffer his own daughter in the porn business, Jameson is adamant on her daughter being far from it. This double standard is the most salient feature of pornstars who have children. It is noteworthy she expresses no remorse over her life. Her life is essentially morally lawless. And, with other lawless ones, she will go to hell unless she repents and asks Jesus to forgive her. Any quick perusal on the internet of her films shows the depths of depravity, not to mention anti-hygiene, she subjects herself in her movies. Her memoirs also have an air of self-importance. Her great wealth seems to have deceived her into thinking she has some positive attribute that is worthy of being memorialized. This arrogence is a typical accompaniment to those who live sinful lives. Afterall, all sin is some form of self-centeredness, be it pride, avarice, covetedness, and so on. Her girl-girl acts are quite shameful. Neither these acts nor even the hetersexual ones ever act out normal sexual relations. Of course, the former acts are impossible to conform to any standard of sexual morality. The devil has blinded her mind and she needs serious prayer that she may come to repentence, if that is still possible. Her acts are idolatrous because she is greedy, and worships money and sex with equal devotion. Her sexual acts aren't loving. They amount to an idoltrous subjection of one human being to another that defies the purity, integrity and normalcy of marital heterosexual love. She seems to get a thrill, albeit an unhealthy one, of sex acts that defile the normal order of things. This is not only a learned behavior. It is a manifestation of that satanic defiance of God's holy order of things. It is no coincidence that people in this industry tend to be satanists. Their wallowing in iniquity usually sedways into wallowing in blasphemy. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. They should fear the one, namely, God, who has the power of throwing body and soul in hell rather than indulging in blasphemous mockery of Him. They should repent and ask for His mercy while they still have that offer available to them and go to the cross of our Lord for His free gift of salvation."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Yes, we all love the picture of Jenna Jameson in Times Square (I think that was her!), but as for her book, yep, this is a book for all those who want to perfect the art of love (without having recourse to the Kama Sutra or Dr. Seuss's guide to European Brothels). I can't say much more about it, but what I can tell you is that if you ever want to know how to make love like a toilet, complete with flushing, plungers, Mr. Clean and quacking toiletducks, and then find out how to get transformed from a toilet into a pregnant man that still smells like excrement, then check out a book called, \\"Toilet: The Novel\\".

Instead it is filled with fiction from beginning to end. Obviously this woman will stoop to any level to sell a book and justify the choices she made in her life. Denial it isn't just a river in Egypt. Seems to me she is getting old , married to a relious porn star and they want to have a kid. As well as get richer than they already with this book. Instead of looking back at the choices she made in her life and accepting responsibility for them. She paints herself as a victim Get real. While reading this book I found so many inconsistencies that lead me as a reader to the conclusion she lied allot. For instance she claims she was gang raped when she was 16 in Montana then later that same year at 16 was raped by some old guy. Terrible stuff. The part I don't understand is if those things really did happen why does she claims she was raped by the old guy and that rape took away her innocence. I understand how rape does that to a person. I am not arguing that but let's back up here. Being gang raped prior to being raped by the old man didn't take away her innocence?This is one of many inconsistencies and contradictions I found in this book. Supermodel Cindy Crawford is the first of what I think will be many celebrities who are coming forward to say what Jenna Jameson wrote about her in this book just never happened. Jenna is so jealous of mainstream celebrities it's pathetic. She wants to be respected and the entire world to know she isn't easy just because she is a porn star. Hello how many people has this woman slept with in her lifetime? She is nothing more than a glorified hooker. The only difference is instead of sleeping with men for 20 bucks a pop she does it for allot more money. I feel bad for the child she wants to have. Some people shouldn't be allowed to breed Jenna Jameson is one of those people."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I found this book offensive to a normal adult mind. I bought what I thought was an autobiography, and what I found was a story full of inconsistency's and stinking of prefabricated BS. I am truly disappointed. It is so sad to see someone that is obviously still looking to be the center of attention to make up for her childhood. Grow up Jenna! The world has many more interesting things to do then cater to your issues. We all have our own issues to deal with. You can't do anything about the way you started out but you can grow up and do something about the way you end up.

However, if you enjoy reading biographies of life's survivors, then this is a must read. The adversities that Jenna has overcome are absolutely bewildering. I am astounded that she didn't commit suicide. I like the disconnected format of the book, because it is creative and illustrates the way her life progressed. She may be a porn star, but I'll bet she has more honesty than than every single politician in this country. How many of them are willing to tell their complete life story?"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I went into reading this thinking that it was going to be a fluffy, and slightly trashy, read about the life of porn megastar Jenna Jameson.And while several portions were trashy, I came away feeling I had read an extremely well-written biography about a woman who has thoroughly experienced the extreme highs and lows of life. It begins with the murder of a young woman, which segues into Jenna's entrance into the world of adult entertainment as a stripper, cover model, porn contract girl and finally superstar and brand name.Jenna Jameson and co-author Neil Strauss have a distinct flair in painting a very clear picture of Jameson's road to stardom. They are able to reconstruct very disturbing scenes from Jameson's past without resorting to sensationalism or trying to garner pity.The book is constructed using several different formats (question and answer, interviews with Jameson's family members, humorous cartoons) to shake up the narrative while continuing to move the story along. These formats work with the non-traditional nature of the story and are often humorous.And since this is a book about a porn star, don't expect statements of Jameson being 'forced' or 'coerced' into the business. While Jameson admits to her initial naivet&eacute; - this quickly evaporates as her own natural ambition takes over. It becomes quite apparent that this is not a 'sex' book - but the autobiography of a woman with strong ambitions in a very non-traditional field.One warning. This is definitely a book to read where you don't have to worry about strangers peeking over your shoulder. There are a few sections with X rated (but still dazzling) photography of Jameson showing her abundant assets.My only gripe with Jameson's book is with the end. I feel the attempt to create a happy-ending is forced. There are several incidents she relates about her and her fianc&eacute; (now husband) that seems to indicate there were some serious problems present in the relationship. Jameson often writes them off as typical couple squabbling, but I found myself slightly disturbed by the arguments and the underlying themes. This was heightened by Jameson's attempt to gloss over it as the bickering of two people deeply in love with each other. They are obviously in love but the it is *not* 'bickering' - it's the arguments of two people who desperately need couple (and solo) therapy.Ultimately, this was a strong read. But I felt that Jameson's epiphany never materialized. I agree with her inferences that porn need not be looked at as 'smut' - but found myself questioning whether she really learned the personal life lessons she claims she has.Jameson is obviously a strong woman - one would have to be to turn her name into a brand in such a difficult field - but the end of the book left an impression that there is still much work to be done. An impression that Jameson seems unaware of by book's end."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was so much better than I thought it was going to be.Although I don't recommend you take this book to work to read, as there are partially nude photos on almost every other page."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"It took Jenna Jameson 576 pages to tell her life story. That's alot considering we're talking about a pornstar. So what happens in her life that is so different from the stereotypical image we all have of the pornstar? She makes a lot of money. That's about it.Where she needed 576 pages (many of which are solo picture pages of her since I'm sure she loves herself as much as her fans do), I can sum up her life in a few lines.1. She had a troubled childhood. Daddy ignored her.2. She met the wrong man and stayed in the relationship for years.3. She stripped.4. She developed a drug habit but beat it because she was strong.5. She entered porn.6. She met many other wrong men and stayed in the relationships way too long.7. She developed another drug addiction (where was that strength?) and beat it.8. She made tons of money.9. She met the right man (although when the relationship sours I'm sure future reprints will paint him as equally flawed) and builds her adult empire.10. Her family returns to mooch off her...but there's a lot of \\"love\\" there.This entire book is an example of someone who thinks they have a story to tell...but they really have no story worth reading."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I respect and like Jenna Jameson for who she is and the positivity that she has given to the adult entertainment industry. From interviews that I've read, she also comes across as well-spoken and likeable.The book is an exciting read, and I couldn't put it down for hours. I think it's a great look into an industry--and to people-- that still have so much stigma attached to them, and this book might even open up some minds.That being said--and perhaps this is some post-James Frey paranoia in me-- I have doubts about a few aspects of the book. First of all, it was ghostwritten by Strauss, so this isn't entirely Jenna speaking. Secondly, there are many overly detailed accounts of sexual escapades, which read like typical porn instead of the cool, matter-of-fact rendering that would be found in a biography. This, along with the numerous nude (though half-censored) photos of Jameson, all comes across as catering mostly to Jameson's male fans, and to males who have not yet discovered her. (Even though Jameson has said she is bisexual, I very much got an impression that this book is aiming primarily at straight guys.) Much of this just seems like a gratuitous ploy to market the book and sell it. Lastly, there are no pictures of Jenna, besides those from her childhood, where she does not look like a porn star. I would have liked to have seen the REAL Jenna, without the perfect makeup and hair and sexy poses. And this makes me think that much of the writing has left out sides of the real Jenna as well.Much of the story seems hyped up, and I get the feeling that some is just not true. I see this book not so much as a biography, but as a fun commodity amongst all her movies, websites, and magazine photos, and it is great advertising for her empire. A little shock and erotica is necessary to compete with all the other kiss and tell books out there, and the one that shines is the one that out-titillates the rest. But I do think there is some fascinating truth in it when you filter out the fluff.Overall, I say read it, but with a little skepticism."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"In her best-selling, 577-page book, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, co-written with music critic Neil Strauss, Jameson reveals a life fraught with abusive boyfriends, family trauma, a horrific gang rape in which she was left for dead, and severe crystal meth addiction that also nearly ended her life.....Despite the unpleasant events in Jameson's life, the book is less a downer than a bawdy roller coaster ride jam-packed with explicit sexual anecdotes, celebrity gossip, comic strips, full-page color photos and random diary entries printed in Jameson's handwriting. Craftily packaged, the highly visual tome is the perfect product for the Attention Deficit Disorder-afflicted surfers of Internet porn sites and cable TV - a book for people who hate to read.(From my profile of Jenna Jameson in ZOO magazine)"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Rarely does anybody reveal the bare truth the way Jenna Jameson has in this book.

The book is a very good autobiography. The book starts when Jenna is a teen so it's not like you have to read too much about her early early years, a problem I see with a lot of tell all's. The prologue sets the tone for the book as Jenna describes an incident with an early friend. The book written in first person by Jenna is so real. The pictures, the notes, the photocopied clippings, it's really an exciting book and although it has a large page count I never found a dull moment.The one thing I picked up is that Jenna is a person who seems to want to tell her story as candid and honest as possible and she has no qualms about discussing her own fears and regrets about situations. She had a rough life and it's hard not to sympathize with her because of her past. Whether you agree or disagree with her chosen profession this is one of the best celebrity autobiographies of the decade.And despite the title, the story isn't all about sex."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I've never seen a Jenna Jameson movie.

To have gone through all that Jenna Jameson has gone through and still be such a positive person, learning lessons and admitting wrongs is just crazy to me.

I have a new found respect for Jenna Jameson now.The book is a very easy read, there are a few parts that are drawn out a bit much, but for the most part, it's a definate page turner.

She tells how she went from dating a loser to being a porn star. It's well written (although I don't know how much she actually wrote) and she certainly has something to write about.Jenna Jameson tells her story through narrative, cartoon strips, diary entries, interview transcripts, how-to sections, and a script, just for good measure. And photos. Lots and lots and lots of photos.Of these, the narrative is the best, and the photos are nice. It's interesting to see photos of the people being written about. The diary entries (which I somehow doubt are entirely real) and the interview transcripts are boring. I skipped over them. The comic bits were cute, but there were only two of them and they seemed kind of random. The how-to sections were also interesting, but the \\"How to become a male porn star\\" consisted mostly of an interview, which I did not find that interesting.The main reason I took off the fifth star is because of a lengthy section consisting entirely of interview transcripts with her father and brother and journal entries which I doubted were entirely real. It mostly talked about her childhood, and while it had some interesting anecdotes, I mostly just skimmed them.Otherwise, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I was really looking forward to reading Ms. Jameson's autobiography; I've always thought of her as a smart businesswoman. Even though she has more than half a brain, the book is not too articulate.There are so many inconsistencys & it should have been edited down to about half the number of pages. Although I'm sure the large number of pictures in the book were intended to appease her fans, there didn't seem to be a lot of relevancy between them & the chapters they were inserted( the major exception being the wedding pictures-she looks genuinely happy & that is what is expressed in the chapter).If possible, wait for the paperback or borrow the book from a friend, it's not something you'll want to read again & again."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"It's easy to write off sex workers as weak, deluded women who allow themselves to be exploited because of something traumatic in their past. Jenna Jameson was definitely a victim of some really unpleasant people, but she shows us that she's moved on and made herself into a successful, financially independant woman in control of her own destiny. Perhaps it's not the life you or I would choose, but I applaud her efforts and support her right to do so."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I received this book on Thursday about 5PM and it's now 2AM on Saturday morning and I am done. It is a fabulous page turner. It made me cry (especially her dad's letter concerning her mother) and laugh over and over (she has an amazing since of humor). I have been a fan of Jenna since I started college in 1998. My boyfriend then had been a fan before that. She was one of the few porn stars I felt to be sexy rather than just raunchy (all though there is nothing wrong with that). In 2003, at the Hard Rock Casino hotel in Vegas, I got to meet her, well, my nerves had me shaking so I didn't say anything except \\"Will you take a picture with me?\\" and \\"I am so nervous I'm shaking.\\" I got a picture with her. I was so proud of that I sent it to everyone I knew. I saw her E! story and thought even higher of her. Although she is only 4 years older than I am, I look up to her. She is a sexy goddess with a heart of gold. She is funny and smart and I admire her. After reading this book which details her life through good times and bad, my admiration and respect for her have quadrupled. This book was very well written. I liked how the monotony was broken with comics, pictures, journal entries and other interesting tidbits like Baby Steps and the 10 Commandments. I think she is a great female figure who will be a terrific mother! Every good thing that has come is very much deserved. Jenna Rocks!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Greetings fair Amazoniasns. Believe it or not this review may be my biggest challenge yet for a few reasons.1- Until I read this title I had been a virtual autobiographical virgin, i.e. may have read one but not my material of choice as a rule and never reviewed one before.2- Due largely to the above I agonized over trying to seperate the work from the person while planning this review before finally deciding fergeddaboudit.3- Much as I would like to claim being ignorant of who JJ was before opening this tome, being a young(ish) male, that would be stretching crediblity.Jenna the person: In HOW TO MAKE LOVE LIKE A PORN STAR: A CAUTIONARY TALE, Jenna self-depreciatelingly tells all her weakest moments laying herself bare(figuratively and literally) to the reader. Yet reading her story I was struck with her strengh. Love her, hate her or indifferent anyone reading this has to credit her with an incredible fortitude overcoming trauma, heart-ache, and self-destructive tendencies to be where she is today. A few times in the autobiography Jenna patted herself on the back with her intelligence. I tend to agree she is one very smart lady as shown by the fact that Jenna had a goal from early on in her career and reached that goal with little outside help. (With the exception latterly of her husband.) Agree or disagree with her occupational choice but intelligent people would be hard pressed to argue with her brains. Therefore concluding this autobiography I felt an admiration for Jenna the person instead of Jenna the star.Jenna the Writer: Here is what tripped me up reading this book. Turning the pages, and my eyes falling on particular deliscious turns of phrase I wondered who deserves the credit. Jenna, admittedly a bright girl for her survival and accomplichments, or her collaborator Neil Strauss. Finally finishing it hit me, the majority of authorship is irrelevent because throughout the text Ms. Jameson's ne: Mazorelli voice shouts at the audience to be heard. Her tone sets the standard, with her story coloured with a distinctly Jenna wit, humour and insight. Neil Strauss may have polished it up and acted as dream collaborator, but this is Jenna's story. It is in turns touching, funny, and sad but moving. The one minor warning is that when I read the first two chapters I was getting really into the tale, then the continuity seemed interrupted by humourous cartoons etc... however I quickly adjusted to this and learned to appreciate it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I loved this book it was written well and had beautiful pictures of jenna. Great for any jenna fan."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"i was looking forward to reading this book, and was suprised how honest and good this book was. it was so entertaining, and showed the darker side of someone who is so succesful and beautiful. its overall a great read, highly recomended."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I was disappointed that the book fell apart the first day I opened it. I think the binding on the soft covered book I purchased was very cheap, so then it was not a good deal. The book was not what I expected but the auto/bio was well written if one really wanted to hear about the family life of Jenna (Jamison)--I didn't. The title was deceiving except for \\"A Cautionary Tale\\". I should have noticed!! Both the physical book and the content left me feeling duped and out $15.00... oh well, live and learn."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This autobiography is intelligent and insightful yet also carries an implied cautionary message about looking before leaping, but if you dare leap never apologize nor lose sight of your prime life dream even if it seems to be drifting further away. Perhaps the most famous porn star of the 1990s perhaps since Deep Throat, Ms. Jameson was a Vegas cheerleader with a cop for a father. At sixteen she met and fell in love with Jack the tattoo artist, whose uncle raped her. Feeling guilt and unable to tell her dad, Ms. Jameson moved in with Jack. One year later her r&eacute;sum&eacute; included stripper, drug user, nude model and porn film performer. Rather quickly in popular demand, she became the highest paid stripper and porn actress. Fascinatingly as she spiraled from one starring role to another, Ms. Jameson makes a strong case that her parents' family values never left her; as her ultimate dream remained to have a loving family although her life had been a landslide of XXX. That is until she marries for the second time.Well written in a choppy style with a variety of formats that befits the author's life, readers will relish this entertaining yet morally uplifting memoir as Ms. Jameson instead of baring her body's Private Parts bares her soul. She especially digs deep into her well endowed thriving career in spite of crack and other drug addiction, and horrific relationships. This is a fascinating autobiography that could have used an update since its original released in 2004 as readers will want to know what she plans to tell her twins when they are older about her career.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Not quite what I expected but still enjoyed it.

I haven't seen any of Ms. Jameson's film work, but thanks to this book I might just have to stop by Ye Olde Adult Shoppe and pick a few DVDs up.With the help of rock'n'roll author Neil Strauss (who co-penned Marilyn Manson's autobiography), Jameson has crafted a real page-turner. There's a freaking dead body in the prologue, for chrissakes! There's stripping, nude modeling, drugs, rock'n'roll, and, of course, sex--all detailed in Penthouse Letters-worthy prose. There are some comics, interviews, diary entries, and pictures that make the 500+ pages go pretty fast. It might very well be the best trashy tell-all you'll ever read."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"From the first page to the very last, I was hooked.

But she makes no apologies.The book is sad,happy,funny and never dull.By the end of the book you know about Adult Entertainment that you might want to know.

Jenna touched on the very interesting details of her life by jumbling the sequence in which they occured, making the book much more exciting. This is not a \\"poor me\\" story, Jenna doesn't try to make herself look like a victim to justify her occupation. The photos of her are absolutly beautiful."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I found this book interesting and insightful on some subjects I knew very little of. I read a lot of romance novels and this book reminded me of one, such as overcoming diversities, falling in love with the \\"wrong person\\" and finding your true love... and just like a romance novel mostly fiction.There are a lot of inconsistencies in the book. For example Jenna claims she lost her virginity at the age of 19 and there was blood streaking down below her knees but in her diary entry she's only 15. The chronological order of the book gets confusing usually when its dealing with her teen years. I don't the book is a MUST read but if you ever have time to kill, then it would be a good read."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Entertaining book, but I suspect she's running game on you, dear reader.Whether all fact, all fiction, or (most likely) a mixture, the book is a fun read.Jenna really knows how to market herself and offers good advice to any person wanting to enter the adult industry.She is a bit hung up on age though -- I honestly thought Jenna was 40 -- the years of hard living are quickly catching up. She goes on and on about how \\"young\\" she looks and appears to others.I give her this -- she's made millions and knows how to package and market herself.But I get the feeling that she is not bisexual, but a total lesbian and a man hater."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I bought this book in the airport on a Friday, and finished it by Sunday.

I gave it to two girlfriends at my job and told them that if they didn't get it, they would, Both girls gave the book back to me totally getting it. Now, I'm not a porn star buff nor do I frequent the web sites, but I must say, I could not put this book down. The way Jenna describes being sexual with certain people, my goodness! I felt like I watching the porn instead of reading about it! But in all seriousness, I also loved how she talked about what was going in inside of her mind and soul while going thru all of this stuff. I, including my girlfriends, could even understand the turmoils Jenna went through with certain men in her life that she really loved because we have all been there. The pictures looked great also, but as I saw in other reviews, you have to watch where you are reading it or you'll get funny looks from others! This was not like other celebrity tell all's that I have read in the past. I also admire that she was able to get straight again and take control of her life and career. If you are going to read this book, it is emotionally moving, funny, and yes, it is a TURN ON!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson has come a long way with her career.

And now her own book talking about sex. She give advice on people to upgrade their sex lives in the bedroom. When she mean have sex like a porn star, it's another way of saying get away from their boring average sex lives."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"From her humble beginnings as a high schooler in Las Vegas to her ascent to superstardom, this book covers Jenna Jameson's meteoric rise through the adult film industry. Born and raised in Las Vegas, Jenna Massoli, at the tender age of sixteen, began frequenting tattoo parlors and hanging out with a very surly crowd. One person, Jack, befriended Jenna and soon they were going out together. However, on a trip to Jack's uncle's yacht, Jenna gets raped. This incident started a chain reaction in her life which led to drug abuse, rebellion, and ultimately her entrance into the world of pornography.In the years that followed her encounter on the yacht, Jenna rose up the ladder of the adult film business at a skyrocketing pace. She started out dancing in clubs, but graduated to magazine layouts and ultimately adult films, while leaving a path of broken relationships (both male and female) in her wake. Jenna's true wish was to find a person she could settle down with and have a family, but it seemed that every relationship she entered into turned sour and ended with huge fights and nasty breakups. The drug abuse grew, and she developed a serious eating disorder. In the end, she was able to overcome her addictions and find someone she truly loved.I found this book to be a thought-provoking look inside the adult film and entertainment industry. Jenna gives a no-holds-barred narrative about the business itself and about her own personal life and struggles to make something of herself. She describes each awful relationship she entered into, along with her encounters with such celebrities as Bruce Willis, Tommy Lee, and Howard Stern. Jenna is now recognized as the top female porn star in history. I give this book a very high recommendation. Jenna's story is both exciting and funny at the same time, and you'll find yourself laughing and sympathizing with her. Read this book and watch the life of an adult film actress unfold."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was not what I expected at all.

Yes, Jenna Jameson is a porn star, and yes she and other members of her family have done drugs, so if you want to write them off as bad and worthless go ahead, but you won't like this book. Not that I am condoning drugs or sex, but what do you expect the life of a porn star to be like.That aside I think JJ does a great job talking about the mistakes she's made the lessons learned from them. In fact I think certain parts of the book would be beneficial to teen girls and even boys - with all the hormones, change, and new discoverys they have going on in their lives.This book is both very entertaining and very informative, I definately recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I loved this book, I am a Jenna Jameson fan and I grabbed this book, read it right away and have read it two more time. Put your opinions aside of what you may think of her due to her occupation. This book talks about more then just how she became a porn star but how she became who she is. A smart business woman who has made an empire for herself out of something that is so controversial and still managed to find happiness after a long stuggle in her life. I have so much respect for her and I think that she is an example to many women."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Despite the book's name, How to make love like a porn star, the book is an autobiography of the life of Jenna Jameson. The book goes deep into her thoughts and emotions when doing her profession. I have never personally read a book like this and it's one of a kind.

I have not been able to find alot that inspires me, but this book has been an enormous inspiration to me. I respect that she has made choices according to what she wants, not what others want. She has shown herself to be such an incredibly strong person, and successful in whatever she puts her mind to. It is an amazing inspiration to read about her life, and how she pulled through after experiencing rape, drug addictions, abuse, and heartache from break-ups, and the fading of friendships with people she truly loved. It kind of reinstates the belief that bad things happen to you for a reason, you can learn from them and never should never give up. I would definitely reccomend this book to any one who needs motivation to get out of bed and keep going, no matter what life throws at you. Jenna is a perfect example that you are responsible to make yourself happy, noone else will do it for you. This is a excellent biography on an extremely brilliant business mind, who happens to be one of the most beautiful women in the world.

To find out why a white-trash girl with bad teeth became the Queen of Sleaze?? She is nothing more than a hooker on film, and I don't believe this qualifies as being interesting enough material for a literary project. In today's world, with all its turmoil, why should we care about a 'woman' (and I do use the term loosely) who has sex on camera with anyone and everyone??? Aren't there people who actually have MORALS that we can read about? The very fact that Jenna sees her life to be fit (and interesting enough) for an autobiography proves that she thinks quite highly of herself, even while the rest of the world doesn't."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Last time I checked, porn actresses had sex on camera for money. Faking it -and faking it well- is the standard. So what in hell is a lame, media creation like Jenna \\"Robowhore\\" Jameson doing offering advice on how to \\"MAKE LOVE\\" like a pornstar? She doesn't make love on camera and she does a really horrible job faking it at that! All those robo-hoes over at Vivid with those tascky \\"J\\" names (Jenna, Jana, Jemma, Janine, ad nauseum) are some of the worst performers in the porn biz. The problem is Vivid is a company with much clout and big money backing. They're able to get hotel and cable contracts, etc. That is why you see all of these okie, redneck, blonde bimbos as representing the porn industry. Media goes with what's glitzy and readily available and Vivid sure knows how to promote it's lukewarm, racist, every-other-scene-is-a-lesbo-one, product. In reality outside of hypocritical Red-State-America if you go into these small shops that specialize only in adult film, you will see few Vivid or even Digital Playground titles. The few you will find will be mostly 4-hour comp DVDs and many of these will have a coat of shelf dust on them. Very, very few hardcore porn enthusiasts have the time of day for Jenna Lameson or the Vivid Robowhore Army."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Most people, I suspect, when they spy the title of Jenna Jameson's \\"How To Make Love Like A Porn Star\\" rarely see the next line of the title \\":A Cautionary Tale\\". The glitz, the glamour, the women and men, and the sex are what they think porn is all about. The tawdry, abusive, dirty and sad side of life is the real world of porn.Jenna Jameson aka Jenna Massoli was born in Las Vegas. Her mother was a Vegas showgirl and died a very painful death from cancer when Jenna was a small child. Her father never really recovered from his wife's death. He became a policeman and essentially left Jenna and her brother Jack to grow up by themselves. He was absent from much of their lives. They moved frequently and Jenna had a hectic life. Never really making friends and never having a loving relationship. In one small town in Montana she was gang raped and left for dead. Jenna reacted violently and injured a girl who had been abusive to her. The family left town - the same way they reacted with all problems; fleeing and never facing the problem head-on. Jenna drifted into one bad relationship after another and learned to make money with her body. At first she danced in a strip club and moved on to stripping and then on to porn stills and then porn movies.Much of this book is about Jenna and her life in the porn business. She is quite open about the drugs and alcohol and life she led. In order to maintain a semblance of life she had affairs with men and women she worked with. She tells us of her life and that of other female and male porn stars. At times she tries to glamorize the business by talking of the money, the clothes, the make-up, the travel, and all the people she met. But most of the book is about her search for love, and of course, for love in all the wrong places with all the wrong people. She believes that celebrities will welcome her into their lives and business. She tells of her affairs with well known Hollywood stars and rock band members. But beneath all of this is the raw, gritty life of the porn star that survives on booze and drugs and never makes it to the top. This is a sad story of a life of a young woman who did not have a family to support her. She only knew that she had to fight and kick her way into life and that is what she is still doing. Jenna has some good insight into her life and the men she loved, but she is unable to leave the business. She is still making movies and at times dreaming of having children. She is proud that she has been able to rise above her stripper life and make her way in the world. She married a kindred soul, and they are in business together. It seems this is enough for Jenna Jameson.This is a very honest portrayal of life in the porn business. Jenna Jameson does not pull any punches. She does not make excuses for her life, nor does she try to leave the business. This is her life she believes, and she will make the best of it. She is a success she believes because she has learned from her inner strength, and not waiting for fulfillment from someone else. A good read but not for the squeamish. prisrob"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson pours out her heart and soul in this autobiography that gives us a detailed and colorful account of her exciting life and career. I was aware of who she was from the time I saw her in a porn movie many years ago. There was something so sensual about the way she performs for the camera. If I could use the word grace about something related to porn, in my mind Jenna Jameson is the most graceful porn diva out there.To be honest I was enticed about the title and the cover when I bought the book. The book is very thick, but don't be afraid, as over a third of its content is comprised of pictures and collages of beautiful Jenna. However, I found it hard to read in the subway as the revealing pictures got a lot of attention by other commuters. The fix to this problem was to start carrying a white sheet of paper that would cover the pictures while I would read the text.Jenna's life is exciting, sad, dramatic, abusive, humorous, and extravagant all at the same time, and she does an excellent job at opening her heart to the public. She takes the reader on a journey that starts with a naughty little girl that plays with Barbies and also has a certain tomboy side to her, and finishes with a giant porn diva that sits at the top of thirty six billion dollars a year industry. This journey is full of ups and downs, which Jenna manages to turn into constant learning and self-exploration. She is very generous at sharing these learning experiences in the shapes of Jenna philosophies about family, love, relationships, sex, drugs, or all kinds of other dependencies. And as nobody in a healthy state of mind should take these philosophies at face value, they are nevertheless entertaining and will give you some interesting perspectives on all these well-debated issues.The book is a wealth of knowledge about the porn industry. If you are thinking about making it in this business, this book will be your new Bible. It is fascinating to find out about the sad self-destructive lives of most porn stars. If you are like me (or every guy I have talked to) and wondered about being a porn star, reading this book will definitely make you reconsider.Also, if you enjoy juicy gossips (who doesn't?) about the rich and famous, this book will prove to be very informative at that matter. You will find interesting bits about Nicholas Cage, Nikki Sixx, Tome Lee, Marilyn Manson, Derek Jeter, Joe Montana, Pamela Anderson, or the Undertaker. Who would have thought that Marilyn Manson likes to cuddle after he has sex? Who would have thought Nicholas Cage smells like the homeless people at the subway stations?I will highly recommend this book to anybody that likes to mix up his or her reading materials. If you are a fan of biographies, this book is must! If you have taken an interest on the porn industry this book will be eye-opening (no pun intended)."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"A previous reviewer called this book self-serving, boring, and alleges that a school report is more interesting than Jenna's memoir. The reviewer also alleges that the author is less than intelligent. All I have to ask is this: did you even open the book, much less read it? Most likely, I'd guess the answer is 'no' and the reviewer's ragging on the book only because it's written by a pornstar.The book is hardly boring. Its prologue begins with Jenna stumbling across her best friend--the stripper who showed her the ropes of stripping--hanging dead from a noose in her bathroom. That prologue sets the tone for the entire rest of the book, and each of her anecdotes and stories maintain quick pacing.You follow her through her life as she recalls being sexually assaulted twice before she ever turned eighteen. You follow her tale, which is one of a very scarred, injured, and wounded individual getting carried away by the momentum of trauma which leads to an unhealthy lifestyle. She shares her stories of her dependency on men and drugs, both of which contribute to make her life worse and worse. It's a story about a woman coming through the other side. She also very straight-forwardly tells about the not-so-bright choices she's made, sometimes one after another, which, I feel, is hardly self-serving. She's no saint and she doesn't try to be.For the record, I'm female and I enjoyed the book. I actually think women may enjoy this book more than men, because it's a very personal story about another woman's life. She centers her story around her life, not just porn, so I really do see women being able to relate more to her troubles.This isn't my advocating the life of in pornography or lauding Jenna Jameson as someone whose life is worth admiration, but I definitely admire her spirit and fortitude. She's quitting movies now and is looking to settle down with her husband and raise a family (though she realizes the challenges her children will have to face having the queen of porn as a mother). While I certainly disagreed with her choice of lifestyle, I began to feel for her as she tells the story of how she came about her hard-won independence from drugs and abusive men. While she never puts down her choice of doing porn, she constantly warns both male and female readers about the pitfalls of such a career choice and the detriment it can cause to a person's life (for instance, she warns that normal relationships are very hard to come by in the industry because it's hard for one partner to watch another have sex with other people for a living).What I found wasn't a pornstar glamourizing her lifestyle. What I did find was a surprisingly intelligent and articulate woman divulging her past. Her story doesn't revolve around glitz and glam, rather, it centers around abuse and heartache.Her tone is completely unapologetic and candid, but never arrogant. She presents her story in a \\"here I am--take it or leave it\\" manner. Most of all, I felt her story was genuine. Even when she goes on about another man who mistreats her, you don't feel as if she's trying to win sympathy. Her tone indicates she understands it was her fault in the first place for putting herself in that situation in the first place. That very tone is what keeps the book from turning into a sob-fest.This certainly isn't a book for the prudish. Being a porn star, she does talk about sex. I did not feel she was gratuitous, but she definitely was candid. And depending on your constitution for the topic, my 'candid' may be your 'gratuitous.' I didn't have a problem picking up a memoir of a pornstar. I've seen her work, I was genuinely curious about her life, and I had no problem with the subject matter--if you feel similarly, it's quite a fascinating read. She's surprisingly articulate!This is something definitely for the 18 and older crowd, not for younger readers (as if the title didn't indicate that). She talks about sex, drug dependency, death, sexual assault, and she also describes her encounters with the same sex (she's bisexual). If you can stomach that list of topics, you'll be able to stomach the book. If any of the above listed subject matter turns your stomach, you should definitely reconsider. It is, however, a fascinating, whirlwind-paced look back on the life of the most famous face of adult films."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I am not sure why I am disappointed, I almost feel ashamed of myself for expecting more. I was hoping this book would reveal to me something in Jenna's character that would make me think she is a sharp, bright, hardworking woman who despite her career choice, used intelligence and a strong work ethic to get to the top. Unfortunately, this book served as enlightenment to the facts that she is just a pretty pathetic person with really bad neediness issues, little self control, an extreme case of self-importance, and a very disturbing sense of entitlement. I couldn't care less if she's a porn star, a hooker, a doctor or a schoolteacher. I take little issue with the porn industry or Jenna's choice to become part of it. The worst part of this book - and her story - is that she seems to take pride in what most would consider serious character flaws, obnoxious behavior and poor decsion making skills. At times, it was cringe inducing...almost like watching one of those really bad talk shows, where you need to change the channel because you are so embarassed for the behavior of the people on it. Aside from all that, the book was written in a fairly adolescent voice and suffered from many confusing inconsistencies, and seemingly embellished or totally fabricated stories."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I was intrigued enough to buy this book when I read the many glowing reviews. However, after reading it two things spring to mind:1) Jameson is smarter than many people give her credit for.2) Either she has had the most trying life I know of, or she is a capable embellisher.Most of the 'stories' in this book have the ring ot some truth in them, but I can't help but think that the details have been exagerrated. Come on...her father sat around and did drugs with them, only to then say that the best drug is crank? Her father single-handedly shot over 60 Viet Cong? She was kidnapped by the local mafia while her father was a cop?I enjoyed the book...but I suggest you take it with a LARGE grain of salt."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"If you are looking for a book that is up close and personal, this is it, but a bit too much. You will learn that with all the beauty Jenna Jameson has, brains and maturity are lacking. A crazy ride this book offers from her inability to handle life by diving into drugs and sex, and learning that she has no strength to depend on her self. She is the kind of girl that is always in need to be in a relationship, via man or woman, because she lacks the mental maturity and emotional stability to be strong in her own right. A very long book and entertaining, but towards the end it just gets exhausting reading about how hopelessly dumb she really is, always falling in love with guys who abuse her, needing drugs to forget life, thinking she's the queen, etc. Some girls lack strength and have to be in a relationship all the time, I know a few and they tend to be kind of nuts. But one thing this book did do to me is change the way I view Jenna Jameson, I could probably never watch another video of her again, and many of the girls she mentions as well. When you learn the secrets behind the porn scenes it kind of puts a bad taste in your mouth, at least that is what happened with me. The drug abuse, the rapes, the lack of maturity, and so on. But as for the book, it is worth the read, you won't be disappointed in the book but you might be disappointed in her."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book could have been a lot of things...an insider's view of a world few of us know anything about, an insightful story of a little girl lost, a 'How To' advice guide into the world of adult entertainment, an utter celebrity dish and gossip fest. It was none of these things, nor do I believe it was honest, revealing or anything other than a self-serving and excruciatingly dull exercise in narcissism.I read this book in a day, but not because it was riveting. It was lightweight, inconsistent, empty and, quite honestly, flabbergasting. And don't be fooled. I haven't given it a 1 Star rating because I felt this book had redeeming qualities, but because no lower rating is possible.Let me be clear: I have no moral objection to Jenna's career choices. If you've got it, flaunt it and if the world weren't so weighted against anyone who isn't born a white male, I might think there was something more significant that Jenna could have done to rake in her millions. What I found objectionable was her monomaniacal take on the events in her life, her total lack of perspective, her willingness to blame everyone else for her pain and suffering and her out-and-out refusal to take responsibility for her choices. One would think that any one of these things would give one pause when writing about 'LIFE'. Not so Jenna. She seems to think that we want her insights on men, life and love. (a PhD in men? I think not!). Spare me.Worse though, is the entirely manipulative tone of the book. Jenna doesn't seem to remember what she's told us from one chapter to the next. The facts don't add up, the events don't mesh, nor are her attitudes clear and consistent. Does she love her Dad? Hate him? Was he a 'fun father' or a lying, money-grubbing leech?Structurally, the book's a mess. Jenna's often incoherent narrative is interspersed with interviews (yawn), numerous (untitled) photos (clearly, Jenna believes we couldn't care less about anyone but her), frankly unbelievable diary entries from her childhood (written, no doubt, last year) and tediously predictable 'How To' checklists.What did I want? Something - anything - insightful. What did I get? Pedestrian drivel. Tell me something I don't know."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson sure knows how to market herself. When she finally made the decision (and by reading this book, you come to understand that women do not get \\"sucked into\\" the porn lifestyle, as has been a long-running stereotype) that she wanted to advance her career to the adult film industry, she entered her first interview claiming she was not there to earn some extra pocket change but because she wanted to become the biggest porn star in the country. A far cry from the self-proclaimed shy tomboy this Italian blonde bombshell was as a child. Now Jenna owns one of the most frequented domains in all of the internet porn community, making her much more than just a Porn Queen: she is also a savvy business woman.It is easy to get sucked into this book by the images that adorn its cover, or even by the pictoral spreads that can be found inside. Jenna strategically chose pictures that would speak to her already existing fans to purchase this book, but it is the story that lies on 577 typed pages inside that will bring her many new fans, admirers, and supporters. She truly has led a remarkable life. And even she admits the things that got her the life she has today: a life in which she is finally happy and settled, will be seen to many others as mistakes. But just as we were taught never to judge books by their covers, so is the case with Jenna's chosen profession.The story is so touching and so sad it is hard to find words to review it. Jenna admits in the book that she doesn't like to talk about the abuse she suffered because she feels (and maybe even fears) that people will use that as an excuse for her entrance into the adult film industry. Maybe that is true; people are more conservative and close-minded than sympathetic toward that industry nowadays. However, it is an aspect of her life that cannot go unnoticed, and it feels like she finally has given herself a sense of closure now that she has written the truth down in these pages. So much occurs in this book- from multiple rapes to stripping while attending high school to two kinds of drug addictions- that you find yourself unable to put down the book until you have read every last word. And the story is told with an eerie ease; it is as if Jenna had this in her all along, and everything she ever did up until now was simply a situation she could use for this book. While some chapters read more like a play, as they are broken down only into dialogue or soundbytes from Jenna, her brother, and her father, the majority of the book is told in standard chapter format. You laugh with her, you cry with her, and more importantly, you feel with her. You finally get a look at the real person under the layers of make-up the industry cakes on her. And she is truly a person, full of real substance. It is a breath of fresh air to prove that.A lot of people who heard this book was coming out probably wrote it off as just another way for her to capitalize on her sex appeal. But nothing in the book comes across that way at all, and if that's all Jenna intended, then she's a better actress through literature than anyone has ever given her credit for on-screen."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson either can write well for part of this story, or she hired a good ghost writer. If this book is to believed, her family probably should be in jail or in the witness protection program. For me, the stories dealing with her actual life as a porn star are probably the part to sort of believe--she does not seem to be making most of that up. Her story about her family, however, seems totally made up or distorted. At one point, I gave up on her and skipped the chapters dealing with her family, as I could no longer suspend my disbelief.In the end, this book is entertaining, but probably not truthful. Ms. Jameson still has the hustler's code for telling you what you want to hear, but not really believing it herself."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson has seen it all: sex, drugs, and rock n' roll; sex on drugs with a rock n' roll star. Addiction, co-dependency, rape, insecurity, stalkers, bad relationships, family drama, true love -- it's all in there.With her bluntness and humor she covers her whole life, from her childhood of yearning for her mother that died when Jenna was three, trying to make her distant father proud, and running wild through the streets with her brother; to her early departure from home and into the relationship that started a seemingly hopeless pattern that echoed through the rest of her life.With forays into lesbianism and drug addiction, crash diets and sex most of us will never see Jenna shows us her flaws and weaknesses, but also her strengths. Her ambition and dedication to stripping and then porn inspired me in a surprisingly powerful way. The inside look into the catty and technical world of adult films was informative, bizzare and gnarly.The book was well written and interspersed with photos, humorous comics, conversations with Jenna, her dad and brother, diary entries, a sample porn contract and Jenna's Ten Commandments. It was never boring or commonplace. Jenna's had an overfull life. I finished it within a day and a half.Most of all I love the seeing the growth and depth she gained. And of course, me being a hopeless romantic, the love she found with her husband Jay and the reconcilliation with her family. A true success story in an unconventional package."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I read this in three days, I'm a big fan of Jenna and loved it but I think it'd be interesting for anyone."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"579 pages seems awfully big for a pornstar. What they do on camera is very exciting but, from what I can tell, there is usually not much else. But of course, this is Jenna Jameson, JENNA!!. Not just some pornstar, but THE P-O-R-N-S-T-A-R!!! The girl who cut such a wide swath in porn as to hit the consciousness of even those who do not watch it. Jeez, I once heard an Evangelical who, I am 99% sure does not watch skin flicks, acknowledge that even he knows who Jenna is.Here, Jenna really does lay it all out. The boys, the girls, the good sex, the bad sex, the users, the loves, the hates and the drugs, drugs, drugs and occasional meltdown. Yes, Jenna really has led a very different life than most people have and it sure is nice of her to give us an inside peak.What is most interesting about this book is that Jenna's porn career (which, let's face it, is the only reason she is well known and accordingly is the only reason anyone would be interested in this book) just blends seamlessly into the tapestry of her life. Good thing porn was there for her as it is almost the only thing she could have done. She knew what she was getting in to, grabbed it and has been riding it ever since for all that it is worth. That she was able to navigate an almost unbelievable amount of slimebags and bottom dwellers to get not only to the top but to cross over a bit (but just a bit) into the mainstream tells us a lot of what this girl is made of. Her career field might be smutty but she has the savvy to make it work.Although HOW TO MAKE LOVE LIKE A PORNSTAR certainly has its salacious moments, I have to give the nod to Tera Patrick's SINNER TAKES ALL on that point. Tera really treats the reader to the written word equivalent of one her pornos in a way that Jenna does not. Though, to be fair, Jenna knocks it way better than either Traci Lords or Christy Canyon in either of their two biographies.And Jenna gets way more points for originality, with the book containing wonderful diversions and tangents like The 10 Commandments for guys trying to score and a another 10 for girls on how to best please their men orally, diary entries stretching back to her childhood and early teens, and cartoon-paneled chapters on stripper injuries and the ways she has been degraded in front of the camera. If you are a man and want to get into the biz and actually make it there, Jenna's got you covered. She even invited her male co-star of her first porn shoot to give his perspective of it alongside her own. Now that is a woman who cares. Her porn film contract is also included (referring to the pornstar as the \\"Talent,\\" which would be a laugh in many cases but quite apropos for Jenna). And wonderfully, she tells of getting hit on by Cindy Crawford (which an internet search reveals is strenuously denied by Crawford, but c'mon, we can dream, can't we?).Kind of like the porn book equivalent of Pulp Fiction, HOW TO MAKE LOVE LIKE A PORNSTAR is not for the linear minded. Cutting into different angles at different times, it keeps the reader's interest to the end. But, hey, like I said at the beginning, it is Jenna."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I didnt know what to expect from Jenna Jameson, so I cant say I was disappointed. The beginning sucked me in and my page 400 I was bored. I finished the book because I got so far and enjoyed it, but was the most disappointed with the end. Definitely not a must read, but not the worst."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was a fantastic read - even if you're not familiar with Jenna Jameson.I had never heard of her yet couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I bought the book more as a joke, but really ended up enjoying it. It was very interestingly put together - diary pages, interviews, prose. Reading her life story makes me sincerely impressed with what she has made of herself. Whether you agree with porn or not, she is a smart business woman. My only caution for the book is that it is FILLED with pictures - mostly of Jenna naked. And although this thrilled my husband, the little lady who sat next to me on the plane was NOT amused."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I always read the 1 star reviews in every product I'm interested in because I tend to agree with them more than the 5 star reviews. Some have 190 5 stars and 24 1 stars and after I've used the product or read it I get so disappointed for listening to all those 5 star raters. But, this book is definitely an exception. I bought this book and once I started reading it I could not put it down. I love books like this and I've only experienced it with ANGELS AND DEMONS, THE DAVINCI CODE, and THE POWER OF NOW. But, I had a final exam to study for and instead I just continued reading this book. It was that good! I feel like everyone can relate to her pains and joys in some way and I find her story so captivating and inspirational!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Although the title is provocative and misleading, this is an autobiography of the leading actress of the adult-film industry. We are treated to an honest account of her ups and downs, and an insider's guide to the secret workings of the industry. Often, her intelligence is surprising. The book closes with the very happy prospect for her husband, her pregnancy and motherhood. But we all know better. After this, she miscarried and filed for divorce. It was then a replay of the sad events recounted here. So, here is a girl who desperately wants to be happy but is somehow fated to fail. This is tragic."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is a decent book. You definately want to keep turning the pages on this one. One problem I find in this book is sometimes a storyline is interrupted with a subject on a whole different topic; I found this distracting. I wish the pictures better matched the area of the book they were displayed in also. It is kind of strange reading about the subject's movie shoot with a picture of her at age 6 next to it. However, this book is very easy to read, interesting, and gives you insight into the life of this successful business woman."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"You would think Jenna Jameson would have nothing to talk about except sex, but I was wrong. This was one of the best books I've ever read. When you first pick up the book all you can think of is she's a porn star. But once you start reading this, you find out she's a person just like everyone else. Except her profession is different. It sickens me to think of everything she's gone through. And I think how can someone put themselves through that. But she felt she had no other choice. Bravo, Jenna on a book well written!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Albeit the incredibly large size of this book I absolutely tore through this one in less than two weeks. I am usually a slow reader and it takes a lot to get my attention, but this book was brilliant! A seriously good story mixed in with amusing insights interjected at all the right times. An emotional roller coaster which will have you begging for more.I would suggest this book to anyone. It is fantastic! You will not be disappointed. If you are, there's something wrong with you. :)"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I thought she'd be more classy at least, so nothing that I wouldn't really expect. good to read if you are looking for an escape from your normal life cuz thus girl is crazy."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Not sure what I was expecitng but this was a dumb, boring book.

After reading the book I felt sorry for Jenna as I think she has tried hard to make herself believe that she's a savvy lady who has never been taken advantage of and has always been in control of her life but I believe her story tells a very different tale.

Its a thoughtfully written yet unapologetic autobiography that happens to be easy to read. Its both gut wrenching and humorous, gritty yet fluffy. Just a total contradiction basically. But I enjoyed it from start to finish. This is not a book that glamorizes theporn industry, it is, as the title states 'a cautionary tale'. This is not a book for younger readers-duh- but I think most adults will find it enjoyable overall. There are better, more in depth reviews than mine but I just wanted to add my two cents. I can't give it five stars because to me it would put it on the same level as literary greats. And this is NOT a literary great. It is what it is: the well written auto biography of a stripper turned porn star, deserving of four stars and your time."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I have to say that I am amazed at the life that Jenna Jameson has lived.

One big part of the book she is just talking with her brother and dad. She explain the advantage and disadvantage of being a porn star.

As a 19 year old, I wanted to find out what would drive a women to be the most illustrious porn star in the biz. Well this book really explains it. And not just that, it shows you that she is not just some blonde bimbo who spreads her legs for any guy. She is a human being who actually has morals! And the way she wrote this book, you can tell that she is very intelligent. While I don't really condone porn and could never do it myself, I have to say that this book gavew me a completely different perspective on Jenns Jameson and I also now have a deep respect for her. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna Jameson's \\"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale\\" is a great story. It's a very thick book with lots of good stories of heartbreak, triumph, embarassment, achievements, love, and many highs and lows-literally. Its alsojam packed with gorgeous pictures of Jenna in all types of costumes/roles and ages ranging from adolescence to recent photos.Her story is well written in a clever chronological way, other autobiographies jump around alot and it drives me crazy. Her life story is an easy flow and it only took me a day and half to read this book. I felt the snippets of Hollywood Gossip and endless lists on how to make it in the porn industry added to the meat of the story. I really enjoyed the gossip parts! The lists are interesting to read but not my primary interest. ;)Her journey starts off as a naive, young girl who really gets mixed up with the wrong crowd. Jenna has many unfortunate experiences but she challenges these circumstances and comes out on top, no pun intended. She decides to be the best she can at anything she tries, namely striping and being a porn star. She is closely on the road to being a great author as well."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"WOW!!! I'm still breathtaken by this book...her courage and strength to be able to bare all in 579 pages!!! (the book was too short!!!) I can honestly say that I have a new found respect for the porn industry...we all have our stories and reasons of doing what we do in life...and Jenna's story is one hell of a ride. Have fun reading it!!! A MUST!!!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Having read Traci Lords' autobiography, and being very disappointed by it, I was a little wary when I heard that Jenna Jameson was writing one too. But after seeing her on The E! I couldn't wait for the book!Jenna Jameson gives the most honest, humorous, tragic, erotic, and yes sometimes repulsive insight into the life of porn star. She has a \\"no-holds barred\\", \\"no-excuses\\" attitude which makes the novel the success that it is.Who hasn't wondered why a girls gets into the porn industry? And who hasn't wondered how they deal with that life, how it affects them, and how they can ultimately find their way out of it in one piece? Jenna answers all of these questions and MORE.She doesn't \\"blame\\" anyone for her choice to go into the porn industry, although she doesn't simply recommend it for everyone either. She tells about the good times and the bad times in equal measure, and is very open and her relationships, and how her line of work affected them. She also discusses her bisexual relationships with the same \\"no excuses, no regrets\\" attitude.Although I can understand how some people might find parts of the book shocking, my hat is off to Jenna for giving an honest look at her life. She knows when to laugh at herself also, and although she does take herself very seriously, she does this is in a very honest way, not like a primadonna.The sections of the novel in which Jenna, her father and brother share memories are very interesting, as they give the reader insight into the lack of stability,cohesion and communication which left Jenna so vulnerable at a very early age.I highly recommend this book. Whether you approve of pornography or not, I think you will close the book feeling more respect for Jenna Jameson that you would ever have imagined possible."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book started out wonderful, then it switched all of a sudden to several chapters of a father, son and daughter's conversation of memories. Stopped the story and you are reading about their conversations in a very uninteresting format. I was in love with this book until this happened. I still haven't read past those chapters because it's so boring."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"First of all, let me say that I have no problem with porn or porn actors. I like some, don't like others - much like with mainstream movies and actors. I really enjoyed Ron Jeremy's book. I think porn is a job.That being said, this is an incredibly boring book. I'm about 1/2 way through, and I don't think I can take it anymore. She reminds me of various people I've known that always had to be the center of attention. If you were in a car wreck, they almost died in a car wreck. If you had surgery, they died on the operating table and were revived at the last minute. If you had a bad childhood, they were raped and beaten. If half the things that Jenna says happened to her and her family, it would have taken several lifetimes. And, as other reviewers have pointed out, her stories conflict with other stories she tells. Just as a sample - her brother kept a gun under his pillow from the time he was six, they dressed up as ninjas when they were children, broke into people's homes, and watched television hiding behind the people's couch without them knowing that they were there, her brother threw a throwing star that stuck in her head, her family was threatened by the mob, they had police protection, she was grabbed by some mobsters as a child, her father shot up the mobster's brothel with a Tommy gun and made them leave the family alone, her father was in Vietnam AND spent 90 days in a hole in Africa waiting to be executed, her whole family disappeared in the beginning and were on the run (why was never explained - at least, not so far). I expected her to be kidnapped by pirates and become the pirate queen at any moment.If you get the Kindle version, parts are very difficult to read. There's a lot of stuff from her supposed diary written in handwriting instead of print, so it had to be scanned in, and there are these weird comic book parts, also scanned in. You have to open them up like a picture, which makes them really hard to read.I would give it zero stars if I could. It's really a shame. It could have been so much more interesting. Sadly enough, she would probably find that people would like her for her real self without all of these stories that she thinks (I guess) make her sound more exciting and interesting."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Although I do not agree with or support Jenna's lifestyle, I have to admit, her book was fascinating, intriguing and educational. Well written, this book keeps the reader rivited to every page (including the pictures! haha). I found Jenna to be a highly intelligent, talented and dynamic person. It is unfortunate that those qualities were used in such a negative way. She is the type of person who could have been highly successful at ANYthing she put her mind to. She is just one of those people who stand out in any crowd. Its not that she was prettier or better at sex. Its that this woman was intelligent, had something special in her personality that stood out above the norm, and most of all is an inherently good person despite her immoral upbringing. I just dont think she is a bad or evil person. I feel so sorry that she has had so much turmoil in her personal life. I wish her the best and hope she finds the eternal peace and happiness she is seeking. She deserves it because she is NOT a bad person, she just had a bad upbringing."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"HOW TO MAKE LOVE LIKE A PORN STAR by Jenna Jameson is not for everyone . . . yet if you'd like to know more about the adult entertainment business, then this is the book for you.Jameson is brutally honest about her background and seems to hide very little (even going into detail about her drug usage) . . . she also cites names, including Howard Stern, Nicholas Cage, Pamela Anderson, and Marilyn Manson.The format is somewhat choppy, broken up by interviews, cartoons, diary entries, \\"how to\\" advice, and--try not to be too disappointed--pictures that might want you to hide this book from others when reading . . . you'll actually be moved by the ending that shows you howfar Jameson has come in her life, settling into married life while becoming CEO is her own video production, licensing, Internet development, and management firm for more than a dozen stars.There were several memorable passages in HOW TO MAKE LOVE . . . my only problem in writing this review is choosing these few that I could run:* The biggest challenge [to making it as a female porn star] is the psychological preparation you need before you walk in the door, to keep yourself from being screwed (metaphorically).What's key here is to set your boundaries and never allow them to be crossed. If you do, it will break you down, and you won't have longevity because you'll be freaked out about the things you've done. You must not be afraid to say no if you're uncomfortable with something. It's nice to bring someone with you, be it a girl or guy, to help you hold your ground.* Then pick a name. Don't use another star in the industry's moniker, like so many other girls do for some reason Pick a name that's original and not cheesy. A classy name like Julia Ann will take you farther than a cheesy one like Craven Booty. Next, make sure you register or buy the Internet domain name for your pseudonym before someone else does.* Question: What do I have to do to date you?Answer (Good Mood): It's all about confidence. It doesn't matter what you look like or how much money you have. If you are self-assured, and you act like you have me if you want me, then I'm yours.Answer (Bad Mood): Get reincarnated."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I read this HUGE book in 2 days. I saw Jenna on E TRue Hollywood Story then again on VH1 and found her beautiful and fascinating. I have not seen her movies, honestly :), but I think she is a fantastic business woman who has clawed her way to the top after a childhood that was sad, lonely, and sometimes tragic. So what if she is a porn star, that is what she wanted, she choose it, and she would quit if she wanted to. Just because she chose a different route for her career doesn't mean it's the wrong one for her. She tells the story of her life in an interesting, sometimes sad, but also no Bull**it about it. This is what happened to her, if your interested, read it, if your offended, don't. That's how she approaches things. I think she is awesome. Would I want my daughter following in her footsteps? Definetly not. Would I want my daughter to grow up a strong, smart, beautiful and independant woman like her? Definetly."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This has been one of the best biographies I have ever read. It was a deep look into the life of Jenna Jameson and I must say that I am very surprised at how well written it was.This book is so real and makes it easier to understand the life of Jenna. I felt connected to Jenna's life with every page I read and I was sad when the book ended. It's a very fast paced read and is almost impossible to put down once you pick it up.The way she shares herself and isn't afraid of how it will make her look is incredible.I barley knew anything about her until I read this and from page one I was hooked.I reccommend this book to anyone! Whether you're a Jenna fan or just simply looking for a good, honest read than this is the book for you!It is amazing what this girl has gone through and even though she said it herslef, she never thought she would be happy.. she has alot to be happy about now! I feel as if I've taken a look into the life of someone I care about. This was an EXCELLENT biography!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I bought this book last week after I saw it in the bookstore. Jenna J had always interested me. After seeing the book in the store I ordered it off amazon (definitely recommended to order off Amazon - in bookstores its 30). I recieved it the next day and began reading it. I could not put it down. It was very interesting reading about her younger life... relationships and bonds. In her book she gives tips that she has learned over time (using peroxide to take menstrual blood stains out of underwear works! :-D ) she also gives tips on sex and oral sex (i must say i tried her tips and my boyfriend was going crazy - he loved it)! its a great book and i have a line up of people wanting to borrow it already! :-D"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Jenna's book is ruined by consistent lies. The book would have been a good read if it cut about 100 pages of the bull about her family. Her Father, Larry, who is everywhere in this book suffers from delusions and a habit of chronic lying. There was no Larry Massoli in Viet Nam. He claims that he killed 60 NVA in one day. Larry buddy, there are military records for that sort of heroism even if you were spec ops! There was no Larry Massoli on the Los Vegas PD. There was no tommygun shooting incident at the Shamrock cathouse either as Larry claims he did. According to him the mob attempted to kill the family countless times. Apparently the Vegas mob can't execute a simple assassination on a soft target? I doubt that. I think the real Larry and Tony (brother) are the meth junkies described in the text. It is a known fact that Jenna supports these two losers. That's why Dad approves of her lifestyle!The book would have been real decent if it didn't have all the fillers. It has a ton of journal entries from when she was in her teens. Is this book for pedophiles? Jenna honey, no one cares about your childhood. There are chapters that are just interviews of her immediate family. They are awful and full of the aforementioned lies. If you skip them the book is tolerable, with plenty of sex and porn industry insider information.Jenna claims that it is brains that got her where she is and that she has empowered her self over men by being in the porn industry? I think you will agree, it was definitely not Jenna's brains that got her where she is. She gets abused and mentally manipulated by about everyone in the book. She is degraded on film. The superstar compensation is good but not worth giving up self dignity. I prefer being on the outside looking in. Jenna, just stick to the Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll. Leave the all the philosophical stuff to someone else. PS I still like your movies.Imagine a book written by a mentally challenged blond, and there you have \\"How to make love...\\"The book is amusing but not very educational. In fact it will insult your intelligence, unless you are the typical porn fan. Then of course it will be the first book you have read in years and you will be ultra impressed with her wit. This is my first and last porn book!Conclusion: Spend your money on her movies instead!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"First off, despite the \\"trying to be cute\\" title, this is not a book on human sexuality (a la \\"The Joys of Sex\\"). It is a memoir, an autobiography.Second, as memiors go, it different. It is not about a person with great virtue or wisdom, or who experienced a transcendent life-affirming convertion of some sort. It is really just about a porn actress who, through luck and undeniable nature talent, in spite of her chronic, but perhaps understandable tendencies to let herself get in physically and psychologically dangerous situations, managed to succeed where so many thousands of broken, battered, drug-addicted, suicide-destine girls have falled. It is tantalizingly slutty and sleezy (for men and probably some women). It is sad at times, and at times very sad in a pathos kind of way. And even the happier moments are tempered with the foreshadowing of some pending proverbial \\"body blow\\" or self-destructive and/or self-loathing behavior by Jenna.But in detail and tone, the book rings true; and it has a morale: What we think is ultimate success in any secular endeavor, is never quite what it is cracked up to be, and if you put too much stock in chasing and getting your dreams, you going to be disappointed, even when every dream \\"seems\\" to come true. Forty years ago, John Lennon and Paul McCarthy said it this way: \\"Money can't buy me love.\\" And Jenna's life, thus far, proves that nothing else can buy you love either except two solid parents who maturely know how to love and model it every minute for their children. And nothing on Earth can change or substitute for that. Jenna, like billions of us in human history, did not have that. So love, the \\"real\\" human success (the proverbial Pearl of Great Price) has eluded her. The book doesn't offer any great answer to this dilemna. That is not its point.And it is full of this fun little subtext: the sex business (stripping, still photography, adult entertainment films), like all other jobs, is chock full of lots of secret \\"tricks of the trade,\\" and it is a guitly pleasure to read what they are, even when performed by emotional growth-stunted woman, and completely vacuous, self-absorbed men who are devoid of any redeeming value (other than providing a sure-fire argument that there is a Hell, and there are some people that are definitely going there. They have already bought their tickets!)Don't buy this book if your are looking for sex secrets. Save $25.00 and get a Cosmo magazine. Like I said above, it is a memoir, presented in multiple formats, which I thought was pretty well done as a literary device, and makes the book a little more interesting, as well.In closing, I'll make an admission and a recommendation. The admission is this: I am an American male in my thirties, and thus obligatorily, but nevertheless with great sincerity, I am madly in love with Jenna Jameson and have been for ten years, so much so that I would throw myself on a live granade for her even though I have never met her personally, and most certainly will never have an intimate relationship with her (much to my own constranation). Porn is the entertainment industry outlet our society created in the last generation to unleash the sexual frustrations of young men, and hence, Jenna, it biggest, prettiest, sexiest star is my generation's Marilyn Monroe or Bette Grable.Now the recommendation: If you want a more uplifting and life affirming memoir to read, get the best book published this year, \\"Father Joe: The Man Who Saved My Soul,\\" by Tony Hendra."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book was so much better than I thought it was going to be.Although I don't recommend you take this book to work to read, as there are partially nude photos on almost every other page. . I loved every page, not once was I bored. Jenna has been through some crazy crazy stuff, and she is in no way afrad to tell you every detail on what happened, which is something I liked a lot about this book. So for all the fans and even those who don't have an opinion on the wonderful Jenna Jameson, this book is a fine read, and will definatly make many have a new respect for who she is. she tells all from early when she was very young, through some rough years that bring her into the porno biz, to her huge success as a mega sex star.

She found a career that she enjoyed, was good at and at which she could earn a living. She went from being controlled and used by others to operating her own business empire. Her story is in some ways the typical American rags-to-riches success story. The fact that she made her career in porn -- well, it's just a detail. The important thing is that she's a Big Winner. If one believes that Jameson always tells the truth about everything, then it might be possible to accept that premise. I don't buy it, and not just because I find the whole porn industry repugnant. There's a gloss over the whole story that seems to designed to reflect light into the eyes rather than revealing anything below the surface, and that's the biggest problem for me.I can't recommend this book unless one is a fan of frequent descriptions of sexual activity of all sorts (although there are things that Jenna will not do), interwoven with a few facts and a lot of &#34;that's my story and I'm sticking to it&#34;."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I guess I just wanted to see if she would whine about all the typical things that a typical bimbo sex worker whines about, and wouldn't you know it.....I am kinda so-so on Jenna, sometimes I think she looks okay but then the camera catches her at a not-so-good angle and she has an actually plain kinda face with little eyes. So, eh, I can take her or leave her. Same with this book, I can take it or leave it. I liked the fact that I was gonna hear her story, since I knew what to expect, then when I heard it, it was kinda worse then I even expected. So....I guess the book was not great, IMO.

She is not elegant, beautiful, classy, or talented. Catherine Zeta Jones she is not. Halle Berry she is not. She will never make it into mainstream celebrityhood. But oh, she darn well wishes she could. She could not make it as a real actress or model, so what does she do? She becomes a porn star. The next obvious choice, right? Apparently to her, it was. But if your only talents were posing in platforms, spreading your legs for anybody, and moaning like an idiot in heat, then I guess your options are few. Oh Jenna, you are truly an inspiration for the girls of America. If only they all reach your level of fame. Their fathers would be so proud. They can say, \\"Yes, that's right.

Jenna Jameson is notorious in the adult film world as being known as queen of the \\"dodgers\\" (a porn term for women who refuse to do sex scenes with black men). Her excuses for \\"dodging\\" have varied over the years: From saying her father wouldn't like it, to blaming Vivid, the company she formerly was contrated with (in truth, Vivid is also notorious for not being interracial friendly), to moaning that it would hurt her career.Jenna should just flat out admit she is a bigot or otherwise has issues with black men.

At least she has improved slightly from the horror she was in Private Parts (the frizzy 80's hair! the bad teeth!) but that's not saying much. I will never understand my fellow man when it comes to this sleazebucket known as Jenna Jameson. But I guess her looks aren't the issue here, it is the horribly written book. HORRIBLE.

Just admit it, you are a two-bit skank who can't do any better. Admit it!!! You'll feel better. She is the green-eyed monster of envy when it comes to REAL actresses or models, you can see it in the way she tries to babble on that Cindy Crawford actually came on to her.

I think she is very beautiful, intelligent, a successful businesswoman, and one hell of an entertainer-but this book I found to be very sugar-coated. I often have a hard time believing most auto-biographies and find the best written biographies on celebrities to be written after they are dead (that's when people aren't afraid to speak the truth and nobody can get sued.) For instance, recently published posthumous biographies of Ava Gardner and Robert Mitchum by the very talented Lee Server provided a whole new plethora of interesting and intimate information never before published.

I also found myself neglecting my homework and other responsibilities in order to read this book. I have already read it twice and plan on reading it agian when I get the chance; I rarely do that with a book.

Jenna tells her story in a fairly descriptive detailed manner, from her dysfunctional family to her tragic events in and out of porn. Jenna shares lots of stories on her past relationships (both men and women) all the way to her current beau with a blend of humor and seriousness. Bonuses include Jenna sharing tips about sex, her personal pictures and tales shared from both her and husbands point of view on how they met. Highly recommended book."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is an amazing book. It is a very real look at the industry, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Her story is very real and gritty. I found it very captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. I found myself really wondering about the choices, no matter how small, we make and what they lead to in the long term. I found myself laughing at her ability to inject humor in certain humorless situations. My heart broke for her emotional pain and longing, and the horrible downward spiral with drug abuse. Her story is one of redemption and finding her true self, and creating a world that fits her needs; not the other way around. And more importantly finding what it really was along the way- that she wanted.One warning with this book: Not all may appreciate the photos, so I recommend having a spare page handy as a marker. Her photos in the book are very beautiful, some are more haunting that others. But there are some folks that may be offended both by her story, and her photos.At first glance, most will think this book a tawdry story about the porn industry. There is nothing tawdry about her story. It's raw, gritty, sometimes humorous, and sometimes painful."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"A cautionary tale indeed! Frank, straighforward story from one of porn's biggest stars. No apologies, no shame and a surprising amount of self-reflection and insight. Jenna's book shows what a great sense of humor she has in this book that is more than just a titillating how-to guide. It's a personal history, a sexual history, an insider's guide to the adult-film industry, and a thriller that goes into detail about Jenna's dark past.

You will learn about her childhood, adolescence, how she came to enter the industry, drugs, murder, celebrities, sex and anything in between. If you enjoy reading biographies, this is definantly one to own."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I'll admit it. I initially bought this book out of feminine curiousity, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Jenna and Neil did a great job in presenting her life.What I thought was most effective was the presentation of her vulnerability and feminity. No matter what you may think of her, after reading this book you'll understand her. To me she's likable and very savvy. Anyone looking to see both sides (her story and a little into the industry) will not be disappointed. Not that Jenna ever could ! :)"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is not a raunchy chronology of a porn career.

It was a no holds barred look at her life. I got the paperback version recently and although the original hardcover was printed in 2004, it would have been nice if the publishers had added a few updated chapters at the end telling how her last marriage fell apart and her relationship with Tito Ortiz. Overall, a very hard to put down read!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"She's more than a silicone brat. Entertaining and informative. More info than anybody outside the porn biz needs to know. Jenna is trying to live better and smarter than her porn sisters."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I never really liked Jenna Jameson before I read this book. After I bought it, I read it 3 times! The story of her life was amazing! True and raw! You look at her as just another blonde, big boobed, bimbo that gets naked for money. After this book, you look at her as the strong, intelligent, sophisticated, woman that she truly is. The hardships that this girl had to endure was absolutely horrible. The book read so very well and I could not put it down each time I read it. Everytime I reread a chapter, it felt like the first! I have to buy a new copy just so that I can read it over and over. I recommend this book to any woman who has had a hard life and taken the rough road. I also recommend this book to anyone who criticizes Jenna for her life choices. You have no idea what your talking about!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I read this book in 2 days - I was taken and fascinated with Jenna's story, I could not put the book down.

I hope she writes another one!!!!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"My best friend told me I should read this book because it was excellent. Although I didn't expect much from it, I began reading it that night. In a matter of days, I was finished with it simply because I couldn't put it down. This book was extremely well written. Jenna Jameson layed it all out for her fans to finally understand the depth of her roller coaster life. The majority of the book was gut-wrenchingly sad, and you find yourself constantly pulling for her to succeed. I loved the diary entries, cartoons, and advice sections placed sporatically throughout the book as well. I'm sure I'll end up re-reading her book again at least one more time. Excellent read. I am now a Jenna fan."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I thought it was great. I finished the book in just a couple of days and was not dissapointed.

However for entertainment purposes this book fit the bill. Just another story not life changing but not that bad either."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I felt throughout reading the book that she was trying to premote herself or talk herself up too rather than it being an honest biography. It wasn't that interesting and i ended up skipping through about half of the book about her childhood as i just couldnt read anymore. For someone who knows nothing about the porn industry some of it was an interesting read, though i felt like things that may have made her look bad were left out and just couldnt feel sorry for her for most of the things that happened in her life as most of them was her own doing. Didn't really enjoy reading it and would't recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Ok, I got this book on a Friday afternoon and I finished on a Sunday evening/night. I literally couldn't put it down. It was sooooooooooo goooood. Jenna's tale plus the writing style of Neil Strauss was absolutely amazing. I recommend this book to anyone. I don't know what else to say!! Just the greatest book ever!!!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I enjoy reading memoirs so picked up this book for an easy \\"on the morning/night commuter ride read.\\" It is an easy book to read (however, the hardcover was not very easy to lug around due to its sheer size; related to that, if you buy the hardcover, you can leave the book jacket at home when you read it in public and it is a very discreet, plain-looking book underneath). If you are looking for juicy details of the adult entertainment industry, I do not think this provides as much of that as one would think. Much of the book was about her early years and then with a greater emphasis on her relationships when she was in the industry. The most annoying parts of this book, which I often skimmed, were interview style chapters in which it is just Jenna, her father, and her brother talking about Jenna's \\"growing up.\\" I think it would have been more preferable if that information was put into narrative format, because when she did expand on her life story in that way, it was much more effective. All in all, mediocre (but readable) memoir on love/sex/relationships, abuse, and drug use/addiction."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"The book came in a much better condidtion than I was expecting. It looked new to me. I would defenetly recommend buying from this seller. As far as reading the book goes. I could not put it down. It's a really big book and I had it finished within 24 hours. That was another thing I liked about the seller, the price was very inexpensive for such a big book."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This book is amazing.

Absolutley worth what I paid for it which was'nt much. Arrived early too!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Love this book. I was just curios about Jennas life and how she got to where she is now. I read this in two days! I couldnt put it down. Its a longer than I expected but I went through it fast. Easy read. However there are a lot of nude pics in the book so if youre looking for a book to read on the train, plane, at school, w/e, I also suggest using a sheet of paper as a book mark to cover the pics as you read. Shes had an amazingly interesting life and i suggest reading this book!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I picked up this book on a whim with no big expectations. I ended up being very interested in it. The story was real and kept you wanting to know what happens next. I have a new respect for Jenna. She has been through some hard times and still managed to get through. However, I would like to see a second book and how the divorce with Jay went."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"An amazingly in-depth admission to life pursuits purely of money and an utter lack of self-decency. The book's subject makes no qualms about doing whatever's necessary to make insane piles of money, and appears to be completely oblivious to the gutter level morality her life has consisted of by way of her vocation. Her discussion of drug use and abuse by herself and family is shocking in a way, as there doesnt' seem to be much in the way of remorse where these subjects are concerned. I have a hard time finding much sympathy about a person who damn near kills herself through extensive hard drug abuse but manages to bounce back (pun fully intended) by fully immersing herself in the lurid porn industry.That said, it is interesting to read a full account of an individual purely driven by the almighty dollar and so utterly lacking in personal conviction and integrity, as far as personal vocation is concerned.I had a hard time seeing Jameson as much of a victim in her book, given the circumstances that she placed herself in. Perhaps all the more shocking is the fact that an individual can make so much money through such a dirty business."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"It was an amazing story about Jamie Jamison's life. She had many heart breaks but came back stronger each time. It showed determation at making yourself the best at what ever goal you set out to reach."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This makes for fascinating reading to say the least. It is an extremely open revelation of how a young girl grows up to be one of the most infamous porn stars of all time. It also is truly, as the title of the book states, a cautionary tale for those who look upon the adult industry as glamorous and \\"great fun.\\" It is also sad in that it is abundantly clear that Jenna could have taken other paths in life--she has talents and depth that most people would never have suspected unless they read this book. And along her path toward eventual happiness, there are horrific experiences that she survived, experiences no parent would ever wish for their offspring. Jenna pulls no punches, it is all laid out there for the reader."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I bought this book as a male college student who is a fan of Jenna. I had read/heard great things about how interesting the book was. I bought it and read it in about 5 days. It was a great book and was so good I would read it for hours and not want to put it down. The last book to do that for me was Harry Potter. It told the story of her life with all sorts of problems. She's very inspirational. The writing was solid (probably due to the guy who wrote it with her). It as fascinating to hear her life story. Only some has to do with the porn industry, and there is little about \\"how to make love like a porn star\\". It is NOT a guide to sex. There are some pointers throughout, but its more like a autobiography. I DEFINITELY recommend this book and hope you go out and read it. You won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I want you to know at the outset that I primarily write reviews for spiritual and philosophical books and maybe some of the people who are my \\"amazon friends\\" might be a little shocked that I read a book by a porn star...uhhhhh...an adult actress...but because I try very hard to be open minded and open hearted and see that the One Living Spirit of God is expressing and extending and experiencing Itself into and through everything and everyone and that whatever our \\"journey\\" is, it is simply a journey back to the Love, the Light, and the Life that we were all created in and out of and besides, dude...it's got naked chicks in it...I found this book to be very well written. I am not surprised. Jenna Jameson seems to be a very centered and a very grounded person considering the kind of work that she does. I really don't have any judgments about the people in the adult industry. Notice how I said the word 'Adult'. Children are not adults. Animals are not adult humans. Any kind of exploitation of animals and children should be done away with. I don't know how, but that is really one of America's dirty little secrets. Maybe if we were all more comfortable in our sexuality and weren't repressed sexually, maybe the \\"seedier\\" side of life would fall away because let's face it, we are not only spiritual beings, we are also sexual beings and to most people the two are completely opposite to one another, but I find the more I want to express my Spirituality, the more I want to express my Sexuality and the more I want to express my Sexuality, the more I want to express my Spirituality. Hey, I've experienced a \\"Kundalini\\" before and you cannot tell me that it's not an orgasm of the spirit. It is truly one of the greatest, most profound feelings I have ever felt and yeah, afterwards I did smoke a cigarette with God...But back to this incredible book. This is the story of a person's journey from darkness into light. You can have your judgments about it, you can call her all sorts of names, we can put psycho-pop-babble labels over everything that she has gone through to make ourselves more comfortable with who she is, but the top and the bottom position I have (puns intended) is that Jenna Jameson is 100% real...except for maybe her breasts...what she does, does not define her whole life just like what you do does not define all of who you are.We have this terrible habit in this country to define somebody or someone by their sexuality. If someone is Homosexual, they must be maladjusted, if someone enjoys sex, they must be a pervert...you can count me in on this list...if someone makes adult films, they must be a slut or a piece of trash...we need to get over this idea that our identity is solely locked into place by the things we participate in; our identity...our true identity... is our ability to shine brightly and beautifully at any given time. If you shine while writing, you are expressing your True Self...if you are shining while painting, you are extending your True Self...if you shine while having sex, you are experiencing your True Self. Bravo for Jenna for getting paid extremely well for what she does. Bravo for Jenna for making this business work for her. This book really made me feel a deep level of appreciation and respect and love for her. This book gave me a major heart on.You do not have to agree with this review, all I'm asking is that if it lead you to an informed decision, then click \\"yes\\" and if it didn't, well, you know what to do. We often judge a \\"book\\" by its cover, but appearances only tell a small percentage of the actual story, what's inside is what ultimately matters. Take the time to read this story, listen to her soul, her spirit, and realize with real eyes see that she is really a human being with her own set of struggles and triumphs, challenges and victories... just like you and just like me...Did I mention that there's pictures of naked chicks?Peace and Blessings"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"When I first purchased this book, I wanted to know what makes a girl into a pornstar and why would she continue to do it if everyone is putting her down. As I read the first 300 pages of this book, I learned that Jenna had serious self-esteem issues to the point of narcissism---sometime that she might still exhibit to this day. That reason for her becoming a pornstar was no surprise but throughout her life, Jenna really hasn't learned anything from her past relationships or mistake and she has not really shed a good light on the sex industry. She claimed that people make stereotypes of her type of lifestyle claiming that pornstars are nothing but sluts. The fact is, she admit she has had sex with many people offscreen even when she was in a relationship. Then what do you call that type of lifestyle then?I thought reading this book would make me understand the porn lifestyle more but it was as I thought it would be. It was a lot of tragic moments and drama. However, I do give her credit for admitting to the fact that she thinks she is better than everyone else by saying that \\"half of the world's men are jerking off to (me)\\" while most pornstars writing a book about themselves would claim themselves to be the victim.A lot of the events of the book are very skeptical and I wonder how much of it are facts. To some extent, some events are exaggerated to the point it makes Jenna a seriously flawed character who only handles the situation with drugs and running away. Even after she sobers up, she repeats the mistake again. There were a lot of philosophical standpoints in the book which sounded more like a third-person observation (Neil Strauss's) than her own self-analysis and I wonder if she really did write anything.The ending of the book wasn't really anything spectacular, she just gets married to Jay. If the book continued, it would show that she has divorced him and is dating Dave Navarro and Tito. So she really hasn't gotten out of that \\"lifestyle.\\"When she claimed she would have become a pornstar anyway if she did not have such a tramatic childhood, I tend to disagree because hopefully her mother would have taught her to have some self-respect. What made her into a pornstar is that she has a big enough ego and has no shame or humiliation. But I guess if her ego was bigger than her implants, she would have become a pornstar anyways."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I don't know how much of this is true, but interesting nonetheless. Somewhat educational about the industry."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I am currently taking a sex pyschology course at school and this book was required. I tell you what, the entire adult industry is full of lies, this books takes you behind the camera and shows you what is really going on. I read it and was disgusted with what she experience before and during her career as an actress. And because of that, I have stopped watching those movies because once you realize the truth, you are never the same. It will change your perspective on that and life."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I thought this book was great.Jenna really gets to the point about all the things she has done in her life.This book has great detail in explaining her sexual experiences as well as her sometimes horrifing life.I would highly recommend this to any one even if your not into porn , because this is not just that."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Let me start by saying I have never even seen one of Jenna's movies but I was interested in knowing her story. This book was great, I was very surprised. It was very well written and a page turner. I read the entire thing in 4 days. I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next. I have a friend who is reading it now and is enjoying it just as much. There is talk about sex obviously but it is not strong or embarrassing to read..I hated for the book to end. I wish her all the best and think she is a great business woman and should be seen as that and not just a porn star."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I have to tell you, I bought this book for the cheap thrills I thought it was gonna possess but lemme tell you something, I found this to be the most entertaining truthful account of someone's life I have ever read. Jenna Jameson poured her heart out to her readers and didn't spare us one detail and that's the true sign of a wonderful and honest human being. I no longer see her as just a (...) star but as a all american girl that went through what alot of other girls wouldn't be able to handle. I'm so happy her life turned out the way it did in the end because now she has a happy marriage and a close relationship with her father and brother. I give her so much credit and respect her very much."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I was already a fan Of Jenna Jameson before the book came out so when I found out she was writing a book I was estatic! The book exceeded all my expectations. It's a huge book filled with beautiful glossy pictures from Jenna's past and b & w photos as well. Her story is heart wrenching, funny, interesting, exciting, informative, and so much more. She includes actual diaries entries from when she was little, conversations with her family, intimate details of her love life, tragic events from her drug abuse and toxic relationships, tips on stripping, gossip about celebrities she's worked with and so much more. I learned so many things about her I never knew. I couldn't put the book down. You will not be disappointed. If you are a fan of Jenna, you will love this book!!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I've never been a big fan of porno in general, but you don't have to be to know Jenna Jameson, who, along with Ron Jeremy have become two people I've become very facsinated with over the years. Thanks to VH1, I learned just the night before, Jenna had a book coming out the next day, so I got up early the next day and did something I rarely do cause I'm more of a movie person, and went out to buy this book. After just the first 20 pages I knew I was in for one of the most interesting books I ever read (I read a lot in high school so I do have other books to compare this to) Today, after a week went by, and only 200 pages were read, I canceled all my plans for the day and read the remaining 400 pages. I loved every page, not once was I bored. Jenna has been through some crazy crazy stuff, and she is in no way afrad to tell you every detail on what happened, which is something I liked a lot about this book. So for all the fans and even those who don't have an opinion on the wonderful Jenna Jameson, this book is a fine read, and will definatly make many have a new respect for who she is. Personally, the book sorta makes me wanna watch some of the films she talks about, simply cause it would be fun to see what she meant by certain things that went on in front of the camera."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I got this book for a cruise I have coming up, and well, needless to say, I think I am going to have to buy another book.

I don't know any other way to put it...I love it!!!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I recieved my book and immediately started in... I put it down only to eat and sleep (a little). I am not a porn fan at all; in fact I am a normal housewife. I saw Jenna's book was in the New York Times Bestseller list and was instantly curious. I hopped on Amazon, read some reviews and noticed the only bad reviews were from ignorant people that have not even read the book. So, I ordered it....I can't tell you how happy I am that I did!! Jenna is an amazing person with an amazing story. WOW! The title is a bit misleading because it is not a how to book and it is not pornographic at all! It's a great insight into a modern pop icons troubled life growing up and how she blossoming into a beautiful person. Jenna chose a path that she felt best suited her; not saying that is a path I would have choosen, but she had a plan. She never looks back with regret on what she has done and looks at as a development and ends to a means. This is a powerfully amazing intelligent woman and not the steroetypic blonde bimbo one would assume. Go Jenna you have a new FAN!"},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This lady's got it all -- looks, brains, chutzpah. No wonder she's gone places! Jenna can do anything she puts her mind to. I mean that; if she decided tomorrow to go to medical school, I have no doubt that she would emerge from her residency in 6 years, ready to perform brain surgery. Or at least plastic surgery. The point is that she is much much more than two big juicy knobs and a hot lovin' caboose. This lady ain't a tramp; she's the perfect woman."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Its not clear what the point of this book is - to make money, to warn others about the lifestyle, to brag about all the big names Jenna has \\"been with\\" - perhaps all the above.Jenna's mother died of cancer while she was young, and her father became a cop. Unfortunately, he didn't have much influence or control over her, and downhill she went - from two early rapes that never would have happened if she had exercised common sense, to stripping, failure to report strong evidence her best friend's \\"suicide\\" was actually a murder, drugs (especially a serious meth problem), becoming a porn star, innumerable failed relationships with both sexes, and incredibly poor money management (she earned $2,000-4,000/day, and until her current husband became manager, had little/nothing to show for it).Sandwiched into this sordid tale are also a couple of \\"how to make it in porn\\" vignettes - one for males, the other for females.One wonders what kind of mother Jenna will become, if she does become one. The best thing I can say is that the book presents a portrait of life in another world."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"this book is a fantastic guilty pleasure. it's like swallowing thirty In Touch magazines whilst smearing swiss cake rolls about your person. what a page turner, and tons of pictures to boot. i recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered about the life of a porn star, or the porn industry in general."},{"Title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Ms. Jameson's descent into the seamy side of porn and nude modeling, while entertaining, is also deeply disturbing.

If you want to learn more personal things about Jenna, this is the way to go.

That information should be much more up front than it currently is. Since I am familiar with AutoCAD 2000 sometimes the book seems out of date. (well it is, acutally)Secondly, Frank Conforti who writes the Microstation portions of the book, frequently says, &quot;this is easy in Microstation.&quot; I get tired of not only the bias but also the oversimplification of the operations.Thirdly, a great deal of the book covers the company histories of Autodesk and Bentley. The writers expressed the value of this to help understand the different philosophies behind the two packages. While I found it interesting, it didn't help me one whit to make me a better user of either program.Fourth, the book deals primarily with the similarities of the two programs. While this is good for a beginner, it leaves unexplained the true power of each system because most tasks can be accomplished in several different ways. The book usually explains the way that is most similar in each program rather than the most efficient way to get something done in each program. The book doesn't cover the tremendous rendering capabilities of Microstation at all, since this is not something that AutoCAD does.Since I think this is a book that would be most helpful to people who are just making the switch (not me who switched four months ago, 90% of what I would consider useful information I've learned on my own or from my fellow workers), it ought to have a chapter about first timers pitfalls.One specific first-timer pitfall is the behaviour of the right mouse button. In AutoCAD the right mouse button is equivalent to hitting enter. It completes every command and restarts the command. In Microstation it is completely opposite; it behaves like AutoCAD's esc key. So the experienced AutoCAD user practically without thinking hits the right mouse button to complete a command, but he will discover to his dismay that nothing happens because he just cancelled the command. This just takes some getting used to.Another thing that everyone tells the new user is there are keyin commands like AutoCAD's command line. Well, hardly. With AutoCAD to create a line all one had to do was type &quot;l&quot; and hit enter. To get microstation to do the same command from its key-in window, first you have to click with the mouse in the key-in window they type &quot;place line&quot; which can be abbreviated to &quot;pl l&quot;. This is much more work than simply clicking the line tool from the toolbar.It has two particularly useful chapters that each take a fairly simple project and go step-by-step through the process of creating the project using each CAD package.It also has an excellent chapter on translating from one to the other. It points out the pitfalls and incompatibilities as well as explaining when you should and shouldn't translate.If I've sounded critical its because I was really wanting a book that teaches more advanced features of Microstation. This isn't it.If you want a nice history of computer aided design, this is a good book. Or if it is your first time using Mircostation this would be pretty handy (though it needs the chapter I described above)"},{"Title":"MicroStation for AutoCAD users: A bi-directional user's handbook","review":"As a beginner to Microstation I had a time with the first example. I'll admit I am biased towards Autocad as that is what I've used for ten years.I was hoping for a book that shows how to do each Autocad command in Microstation. This book does not do this very completely. The index of the book does not list all of the command sets of either program, so you are not getting a lot of coverage on most topics. Trying to find answers to everyday problems is not possible for the most part with this book.My suggestion to anyone who truly wants to learn the other program whether it be Microstation or AutoCad is get a good book on either subject. The most accomplished Microstation user I know swears by Frank Conforti's books on Microstation."},{"Title":"MicroStation for AutoCAD users: A bi-directional user's handbook","review":"This book is mostly inadequate for first time users trying to learn MicroStation. Explanations are too perfunctory, and in many cases lacking key information on how to make a specific command work; opting instead to tell you what the command does (if you are lucky enough to eventually figure out how to make it work). Considering the $60 price tag I had to spend for this book, it was a total waste of money."},{"Title":"MicroStation for AutoCAD users: A bi-directional user's handbook","review":"I have used AutoCAD for about 10 years, of course I am biased. Using this new publication provides a very easy and comfortable way of crossing back and forth between the 2 programs. it is obvious that a lot of working knowledge of each program has gone into this text. I have ENHANCED my job proficiency as a mechanical designer being able to say I possess a productive capability using either CAD program. I am better with AutoCAD but Microstation is coming up fast.I am 50 years old and I truly respect what computers can do if you allow yourself to learn without fighting. This text provides that medium allowing anyone to become proficient with AutoCAD or Microstation, I am no longer biased towards either program. Excellent publication."},{"Title":"MicroStation for AutoCAD users: A bi-directional user's handbook","review":"The is a must-have book for those of us not well versed in both AutoCad and Microstation. It is expecially valuable if you are proficient in one system, and have had some training but not much experience with the other.

Our narrator is Malcolm Vernon, a Frenchman who has followed the doomed Queen Mary from France to Scotland. When the winds of Fate start to change, Malcom hightails it to England to hole up at Haddon Hall with his English cousins. This is where we meet Dorothy. Of course she's beautiful, clever, strong, stubborn and reckless. With a tip of the hat to Shakespeare, Dorothy has fallen in love with John Manners, son of her father's worst enemy. There's a lot of secret wooing going on between these two. Perhaps too much wooing. There's not enough action. Not THAT kind of action! But Major could have thrown in a sword fight or two, or maybe a dangerous encounter with highwaymen. Something. There's a little bit of drama at the end when Dorothy allows her jealousy to place everyone's lives at risk, but it's not much of a payoff. If you want action with your romance, I recommend The Helmet of Navarre by Bertha Runkle."},{"Title":"Secret Life of Fairies, The","review":"I rate the book with 5 stars because my 7 year old daughter loves it. As for Kirkus Reviews -- I hope that Amazon did not pay for their opinion.What was it about The Secret Life that bothers the Kirkus reviewer the most? The Eurocentric illustrations or the missing icing recipe for the fairy cakes? Eurocentric -- get over it! Icing on the cakes... ever heard of Pilsbury?

She hopes to write of fairy sightings or make observations about nature. So, when she came across this delightful book in our local library, she immediately pounced on it. I have to say I found the book quite enchanting in spite of myself. It is a large hardcover book and is filled with lovely illustrations of the fairy folk and even comes with a small fairy pendant on a chain (not that we could play with it, it being a library book and all).There are many interesting 'facts' for fairy enthusiasts - parts of a fairy, the powers they wield, fairy homes (with details as to what is within), fairy fashions, fairy food (with recipes), fairy life, fairy watching (or how one can 'sight' fairies), rules of engagement between fairies and humans (LOL), fairy relatives, and a fairy tale.The highlight of this book is the beautiful full-color illustrations. Oh, and be prepared for your little one insisting on putting out a 'feast' for the wee folk after reading this:)"},{"Title":"Secret Life of Fairies, The","review":"My imagination went wild as soon as I opened this charming book!

All of this was done with great detail and clarity in a very depictive and enjoyable style.I also certainly enjoyed the human dimensions of the book with respect to the character depictions and profiles.

Prakrit is a generic term that encompasses a various of languages that fall between the various Vedic/Sanskrit classical language and the modern Indo-European languages.Unlike Andrew Schelling's free verse translations of Sanskrit poetry, David Ray translates the Prakrit &quot;quartrains&quot; (technically sloka's) into English quartrains. Like Andrew Schelling, David Ray translates the poems into poetry enjoyable without knowledge of the culture in which they were written.Some of these poems have a sparseness one associates with Eastern Asia rather than South Asia e.g. &quot;Afraid of putting out / the lamp / with her tears, / she moves it aside&quot; - others have the more ornate structures associated with South Asia. The translation reflects the diversity of the original anthology - a great read you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Waiting for Godalming","review":"I think this book is one of Rankin's best.

I pray that this review will be read. The topic of child abuse is often secreted in the closets of families, but the damage of the secret, haunts the survivor throughout their lives. The end result we see today in the mental instititions of the world, in the drug rehabilitation programs, on the streets at night and teen pregnancies statistics. All these cases are a great socio-economic cost to society. Too often the victim becomes a law enforcement statistic, and the story behind the behavior is rarely investigated. Prevention is always better than cure and Carlton J. Buller in his book &quot;STOLEN INNOCENCE&quot; has given the world the chance to identify, prevent, detect, and treat survivors of child abuse. We must all listen to the lesson the book gives. I thank you Carlton for your bravery. The book helps the survivor, and parents to recognise their role in breaking the cycle of child abuse in all it's forms. I am glad that Carlton came public in denouncing this universal evil. I am sure that the guiding forces and divine intervention in the writer's experience exists in all of us who have survived as victors and not victims of abuse. To God be the glory."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence","review":"Stolen Innocence left me with the desire to guard and treat all children as precious gems. As you read you realize it does not take a total stranger to ruin ones life. It can be a close or distant relative.

Excellent reading, once you pick it up you won't want to put it down but if you must there'll be a burning desire to get right back to it's unmistakable message. A great source for enlightenment, and awareness. Congrats, Carlton B. I look forward to your next book... Thanks for sharing, Bon chance! khb..."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence","review":"Society seems to put so much energy into saving the Manatees, saving the endangered species, well I think it is high time that we save our children from being abused, sexually, physically and verbally. Stolen Innocence is an incredible insight to how abuse affects a child through his/her growth into adulthood. As the author journeys back to when his first memory of the sexual abuse started and through his teen years and then adulthood it is so plain to see the trauma and pain that he has suffered. The book touches on areas that as a survivor myself I related to in more ways than one. It is very painful to read but refreshing to know that we survivors are not alone in experiencing many of the same emotions and confusion that we go through as children and into adulthood. It is only in taking charge of our lives and healing will any of the pain and suffering be removed. We survivors suppress so much of the painful incidents from the abuse, and reading the book gave me the strength to remember and cry and then let go. It is only in letting go that we begin our healing. This book is definitely worth reading as it stresses breaking the silence on this atrocious act against our children."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence","review":"Stolen Innocence touches your most inner soul. Being a survivor myself I found the book to be painful at times to read as it could very well have been my story. I related to so many of the different behaviors that the author described. The constant jumping from relationship to relationship searching for something but having no clue what that something was. Sabotaging many relationships just to end them but not wanting to be the one to walk away. Enjoying long drives alone just so I could think and escape in my head. I had no idea that these issues were patterns of survivors. I thought I had healed but have realized that I still have quite a bit more healing to do. Abuse on male and female children is a horrible secret that needs to be told. It happens more than anyone cares to recognize and we need to put a stop to it. We need to break the silence. This book clearly states this. I would recommend it to anyone who has been abused or knows someone who is being abused or is a abuser. I keep refering to my copy of the book as different issues pop up. It is great to be able to identify with many of my emotions and realize that I am not alone. Special Thanks to the author for sharing such an in depth journey of his pain, suffering and healing. When reading the book have a box of tissues handy."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence","review":"This book is an honest and truthful account of what it is like to live with and through abuse.

By focusing only on written documentation, traditional historians necessarily confine the groups they can examine to literate societies, thereby excluding most people in the history of human existence. Furthermore, written documents contain the bias of the author, and so cannot always be trusted.Deetz argues that historical archaeology and the study of material culture opens the door to understanding a far wider band of human societies, and can further help us relate to the literate cultures we study, by providing corroborating evidence, in some cases, and filling in the gaps overlooked in traditional written documents in other cases.This work focuses mainly on early New England societies, but the research methods Deetz puts forth readily adapt to studies in other areas. The fact that this book still stands as required reading on university course lists 25 years after its first publication testifies to its usefulness..."},{"Title":"In small things forgotten: An archaeology of early American life","review":"I enjoyed Deetz' newly updated introduction to Historical Archaeology in America. He makes clear that much can be gleaned from the seemingly insignificant material things that are left behind in the process of living. I greatly enjoyed his putting the pieces of the puzzles together. Sometimes the result was an interesting surprise. For instance, I didn't know that porches, which became so popular in America, were not a feature of European houses and were introduced by Africans. \\"Shotgun houses\\" also have African roots. Another surprising story is told by the changing styles of Colonial gravestones. They change subtly as the religious climate changes. The oldest being very stiff and stern and later ones becoming more decorative, replacing deaths heads with angels."},{"Title":"In small things forgotten: An archaeology of early American life","review":"Back forty years ago, when I was first getting into the formal study of \\"material history\\" -- also called \\"historical archaeology,\\" as opposed to prehistorical -- Deetz was one of the principal practitioners in the field, teaching introductory courses at Brown and Berkeley and the University of Virginia. Out of those courses came the first edition of this book, published in 1977. It focused mostly on New England -- but that didn't matter because archaeological method and systematic interpretation is the same whatever milieu one applies it to. But Deetz felt the need to update what he had to say, and to broaden his scope to include the Chesapeake and also African American archaeology, hence this revised edition. The methods have changed somewhat over time, but the author's goals have remained the same.The thing is, museums and recreated communities like Williamsburg, though fascinating, are in no way typical. Nearly all the surviving 17th century houses in Massachusetts are of one or two types, because they were built to last by people with the money to make certain of it -- but most of the population lived in much cruder dwellings, none of which survived. Again, what we see now is not typical. Hence, the necessity of archaeology, even to sort out the everyday history of the past couple of hundred years, even though excavation is often paralleled by published sources and official documents.What Deetz does here is to use a particular specialized subject in each chapter as an elaborated example of one method or principal of historical archaeology. \\"The Anglo-American Past\\" discusses the principal of \\"cultural significance,\\" via the artifact-survival problem noted above, as well as such concepts as \\"horizon\\" vs. \\"tradition.\\" \\"All the Earthenware Plain and Flowered\\" deals with typology, the grouping of artifacts by shared characteristics and their use in interpreting dates and cultural dispersion. (Ceramics fragments are especially important in this.) He also introduces here the notions of technomic, socio-technic, and ideo-technic function, a set of distinctions that appear again and again through the book. \\"Remember Me As You Pass By\\" considers the concept of \\"seriation\\" by discussing the evolution over time of gravestone carving and decoration in early New England (a specialty of Deetz's). Grave markers are especially useful for this since they are seldom moved or destroyed and are self-dating. \\"I Would Have the Howse Stronge in Timber\\" goes into the critical distinction between \\"vernacular\\" architecture, which is ad hoc and organic, and \\"academic\\" architecture, which is based on formal plans and adheres to specific principles of design. \\"Small Things Remembered\\" considers domestic objects -- chairs (rare in early colonial America), bedsteads, eating utensils (knives were common but not forks) -- and such matters as the methods by which household refuse was disposed of.The remaining chapters continue the reader's concise education with frequent examples and side discussions. It's amazing that so much key information could be crammed into fewer than 300 pages. But for anyone with an interest in early American history, or archaeology, or material culture, this book is very highly recommended. It would hard to think of a better place to start."},{"Title":"In small things forgotten: An archaeology of early American life","review":"\\"In Small Things Forgotten\\" is a must-read for archaeologists, historians, or anyone interested in America's past. It is well-written, engaging, and short, and still manages to be one of the defining works of American historical archaeology. It provides fascinating insight into how early American culture developed, but moreover shows how we can piece together this past based on the material clues that our forbears left behind. It shows how the historical record only tells a part of the story, and powerfully demonstrates the stories that can be told be artifacts. For non-archaeologists, the book makes clear how we know what we know about the past. It is accessible, free of too much technical jargon, and will draw you in as new understandings of the past weave together into an overall story.Deetz ranges from ceramics to graveyard headstones to houses, weaving his examples together to show a fundamental shift in American culture: from an organic communal lifestyle to a formalized and individualized one. This analysis shows that from tiny archaeological remains we can understand large-scale social movements. For students of archaeology, Deetz' book is an important milestone that is directly relevant to work being done today. It illustrates a structural-fuctionalist approach to the past, and succinctly sums up some of the basic techniques of archaeology, including pattern recognition, spatial analysis, and seriation. The type of analysis Deetz describes applies not only to American history, but to archaeology of any place and time.Anyone involved in archaeology or history must read \\"In Small Things Forgotten,\\" without exception.

The ingredients and measures are not standard to the U.S. Although equivalents are given, you will need to weigh ingredients and use nonstandard measurements, such as 7/8 of a cup of flour, or 1 ounce wheat bran. The same problem occurs with the ingredients such as biscuit crumbs, strong white flour, clear honey, muscavado sugar, or double cream. The good part is that the design is nice, the pictures are great, and the \\"Perfect Brownies\\" are to die for."},{"Title":"Coffee and Bites","review":"This book was not only a fantastic read, full of informative details for coffee lovers, and spectacularly easy and delicious recipes, it was stylistically marvelous.

I have recommended it many, many times to people who counsel others or who find their energy lost for unexplained reasons."},{"Title":"The Art of Psychic Protection","review":"This book is definitely one of the best books out there on psychic protection. It is responsible, thorough, and very accessible. I have used this book with a wide variety of clients in my personal counseling practice and, no matter how versed they may have been with concepts like 'subtle energies', 'chakras' and such, this book has been helpful to all of them.Readers interested in looking further into this subject will find Samuel Sagan's books to be very helpful, responsibly-written, well-researched, and full of wise information on how we can avoid attacks and/or attachments from astral energies. Sagan is a medical doctor practicing in Australia (he also has established a school there) and his books are top-notch.But for a straightforward approach to this subject, Judy Hall's book is very understandable, and includes wonderful (simple!) exercises that I find very useful indeed. I wish I could rate this book a ten, but 5 stars (the max) is the best I can give. I heartily recommend this book -- good job, Judy, and thank you!"},{"Title":"The Art of Psychic Protection","review":"I felt that, in fairness, I should give this book four stars, because it could be just the ticket for those who are comfortable with using esoteric symbology such as pentagrams and Egyptian crocodile gods. After all, Jung himself noted the vast amount of symbolism we humans rely on to process reality. Each to his own, then! All the same, this is not a book for readers who, like myself, want a more down-to-earth approach. Trouble is, the term *psychic* is open to a wide range of interpretations.Certainly, a great deal of mainstream research on the energetics of thought (from scientific giants like William Braud PhD) has confirmed the fact that we affect each other, just by thinking. But this research has not as yet been translated into practical application in everyday life. At least, not by authors like Judy Hall.If you are interested in the idea of other-world influences, this book could be very useful. However, if you are simply concerned about human influences in this present world, which surely we encounter far more frequently, this book may not be helpful. I must say I have gleaned a few good ideas from this book, and find that it is possible to develop your own strategies from it if you are willing to be creative."},{"Title":"The Art of Psychic Protection","review":"The book covers more issues of psychic protection than most others I have read..!It includes how to deal with psychic (emotional, mental & spiritual) attacks & threats.From subtle \\"attacks\\" hidden within chain letters to more severe threats like how to protect your children from negative energies...The book deals with how to permanently cleanse your own \\"inner demons\\" that sabotage your life, family and home to actually cleansing houses and places from negative intrusion.The methods used ranges from visualistaions, meditation, reiki, crystals to more \\"debatable\\" aproaches like flower essences & aromatherapy.The author is obviously very experienced which unfortunately makes her assume that the reader of the book is if not well but at least fairly familiar with both the recomended methods as well as her use of expressions.The book would get another \\" star\\" if it was equipped with a \\"dictionary\\" explaining her interpretation/meaning of some of the vocubalary used, i.e. the phrase \\"Higher self\\" is referring to \\"The Universal power of Love/ GOD/ Thao\\" etc. which you have to conclude yourself or read the book to understand. There are more similar expressions...It also would get one more \\" star\\" if it was accompanied with a short and comprehensive description of the multitude of \\"methods\\" used - even as a healer myself I got \\"lost\\" when it was taken for granted that you are familiar with all these.However, this is also how the book \\"leaves the reader behind\\".Finally, this book is full of wisdom and experience and is written with love, enthusism and high ambitions to cover all aspects - which is all good.One thing that I wish the book covered more of since it's the Most Powerful Tool of all - the use of \\"The Universal Power of Love/ God/ The Light/ Allah/ Thao\\" - expanding more about this would render it a big + as well!I recommend this book to people with previous experience in the \\"field\\" - if revised as suggested it would reach out to a broader group of readers!Mats Fondelius - CEO"},{"Title":"The Art of Psychic Protection","review":"HI, the book is great and is helping me very much with my Energetic work online of releasing 'negative' emotions.

I was able to correct some problems with my technique by trial and error and by asking questions on various yahoo groups, instead.In my opinion this book's main contributions are showing color paintings created by children at various ages and including a very short collection of some nice seasonal poems that can inspire one's painting.

This is because children experience color in a more vivid and emotional way than many of us. Most adults have lost what they knew about color as children, having been taught that what there is to know about a color is its name and nothing more. The seemingly simple task of preparing to paint is divided into five steps which are discussed in detail; tips for materials are also included. Later chapters give ideas for setting the stage for a painting experience -- such as stories, poetry, seasons, or the moods of nature. Innovative ways to introduce color mixing are also presented.The entire theory of how children perceive color, and its ramifications for introducing painting, is well expressed.

Well, I was wrong. Last year, I saw it at a friend's house and looked through it. I was surprised at what I \\"wasn't\\" doing during out painting time!

Those wanting to go deeper in the things of God are looking for secret sources of power. Both T.F.and Tommy Tenney lay out for us in this book how, when our minds, hearts, and lifestyle line up with God's principles, we will experience God in a newfound way and possess anointed power to accomplish things through His working in us.Discerning proper priorities, they state, is essential, as our focus needs to be on eternal things. Focusing on eternal things does not mean the \\"doing\\" should outweigh our relationship with Him. A serious commitment to forgive others will free us of the past, give God free reign to forgive us, bind Satan's legal right to take advantage of us, and help us experience a fresh move of God.The blood of Jesus is powerful and the authors know that pleading the blood can invoke peace and remedy sickness. The power of the blood too will enable us to rid ourselves of sin, works of the flesh, and protect us from the plagues of the devil.The Tenney's speak of relinquishing everything which includes our desires and ambitions and being willing to serve the Lord any way He desires. As God sees our heart after Him, with pure motives, know He can do a quick work to advance us. Lastly, though much more is contained within, a readiness to repent, rid ourselves of pride, and obey will give us dominance over the enemy.

I give this five stars for wit, wisdom and the wonderful smile it left on my face! Thanks Shirley Jump for this delightfully different romance!Description from the book back cover:Rule #1: Cats have nine lives. Catherine Wyndham had used up her first eight avoiding mishaps and romantic misadventures. Now she had only one more left ... and one last chance to find true love. Rule #2: Cats always land on their feet. Catherine usually did, too, until she was waylaid one night by a purrfectly irresistible veterinarian, Garrett McAllister. He was so kind to her that soon her finicky heart began to melt, even though her inner feline told her she might be headed for a romantic crash landing! Rule #3: Good little kittens grow up, get rescued by the tom of their dreams and live happily ever after ... Is that really a rule, or is it just another romantic furry tail?"},{"Title":"Kissed By Cat (Silhouette Romance)","review":"Catherine Wyndham is a modern-day woman whose biography could read like the best of personal ads: \\"Twenty-something, blonde hair, blue-green eyes. Likes long walks on the beach, intimate conversation, and rescuing stray animals. Looking for a Prince Charming to make my life complete. Also happen to turn into a cat after dark.\\" All right, so maybe her ad wouldn't read like everyone else's. Still, she's nothing if not persistent.Catherine had the fortune of being born into wealthy, royal family, the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wyndham. She also has the very bad misfortune of tangling with a witch named Hezabeth. When Catherine sets the witch's mistreated cat free, she's repaid by being cursed-in the worst way possible. And, by the way, this all occurred over two hundred years ago.Shirley Jump has always had the ability to reel me in with the first sentence of each of her books, refusing to release me until I turn the last page. KISSED BY CAT is no different. Ms. Jump takes a story that without the magic would have been just another modern-day romance, and turns it into an out-of-this-world fairy tale.Catherine Wyndham is a woman cursed. In a style reminiscent of the classical movie Ladyhawke, she is a thoroughly modern woman during the day, and a tree-climbing, dog avoiding, black cat at night. When she's rescued one evening by brown-eyed, animal loving veterinarian Garrett McAllister, she curses the fates that have once again thwarted her quest to live a normal life.As a woman, though, Dr. McAllister is definitely someone worth getting to know. And as emotions churn, and hearts flutter, Catherine knows that sometime in the very near future she's going to have to tell Garrett exactly why she never seems to be available after sundown. For all these years, she's waited for a man who could break Hezabeth's spell-a man who would love her, as both woman and cat. Could Garrett possibly be that man, or will he go screaming for the men in white coats when he hears her outrageous story?I loved KISSED BY CAT. The premise is wonderful, the dialogue witty, the emotions strong. Ms. Jump has once again turned a night of reading into a pleasurable experience, and I highly recommend this book to all lovers of magic and romance."},{"Title":"Public Policy: The Essential Readings","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. The anthology is good in principle. Too few students read the original texts. Too many are fed with more or less adequate second-hand versions of what different scholars are saying.BUT:- While this anthology contains many classics, there is also a lot of less influential, or totally outdated texts that you should not waste your time on- A good anthology requires good synthesizing chapters to make it more than the sum of its parts. The introductory chapters in this one are too brief and not very thrilling.- The texts are too short. You only get little snippets.- Many texts feel outdated, while much of the current litterature is missing.There is a MUCH better public policy anthology which meets all these requirements: Daniel C. McCool (1995) &quot;Public Policy Theories, Models, and Concepts&quot; Prentice Hall. I would recommend that book instead, no doubt. Better, longer, more relevant and up-to-date texts, and very good comments by the editor. Have a look at that book instead of this one!"},{"Title":"Public Policy: The Essential Readings","review":"While selecting textbooks for a public policy theory course, I ran across this reader. It should serve well for a public policy course given a couple limitations. First, the chapters are heterogeneous and uneven. You will need to spend some time deciding what readings are worthwhile and how to organize the readings you wish to keep. Second, the readings will require explicit integration in to lectures and core textbooks. The articles are not very well integrated. In the end, I think this collection of essays will make an excellent resource for instructors who take the time to incorporate some of the excellent chapters. If you want to include original articles from political scientists in a policy course, this is a good place to turn."},{"Title":"Public Policy: The Essential Readings","review":"As this is the first anthology of public policy writings I've read, I can't comment on the quality here as compared to other writings. What I can say (after reading about 80% of the essays) is that this is like most anthologies: thorough, varied, and very poorly organized.The essays here range from everything from philosophy of public policy (Dahl's article) to the tidbits of implementation (Sabatier &amp; Mazmanian's article); from the really well-written (Majone and Wildavsky) to real snoozers (Rubin). With all this variance, the one thing I didn't get is any conflict in views presented. I'm no expert, but I'm sure that public policy experts don't actually agree on as much as these contributors seem to. I can't help getting the feeling that the editors views are amply reflected in these pages.The other complaint is lack of structure.

I work at a major aviation library, and of the 30,000 works in our collections, none has nearly as much information on the development of instrument flight as this. Bravo.In the early days of aviation, a pilot entering clouds had only a compass to guide him on his way. To learn his location, the aviator had to dip below the clouds in hope of seeing familiar landmarks.Dailey's work follows the development of the artificial horizon, the turn coordinator, airspeed indicator, autopilot, and many other instruments, in the search for accurate location in flight. Well researched, with personal observations gained from experience, The Triumph of Instrument Flight reveals the painstaking work and advances in navigation through the fogs of night, weather, and wind.Well done and recommended for those seeking to learn \\"how we got here from there\\", both figuratively and literally."},{"Title":"The Triumph of Instrument Flight: A Retrospective in the Century of U.S. Aviation","review":"The author covers the history of instrument flight in an interesting and highly readable manner. He mixes stories of his own personal flying experiences with lessons in aviation history, and does it in an entertaining and informative fashion. I spent over 30 years in Alaska, most of it in the aviation industry, and of particular interest to me were the author's stories of flying in Alaska shortly after World War II.

Published by Hyperion, 77 W. 66th Street, New York, New York 10023-6298 (previously published as \`Don't Worry, Make Money').This book is a non-fictional, self help/motivational book.The main theme of the book is how to live a life that is more productive, wealthy and carefree. It consists of one hundred short chapters, each with its' own philosophy like \`Be willing to change' or \`Remind yourself that your life isn't your enemy, but your thinking can be'.Richard Carlson has created a whole series of \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\\" books. When you read one, continue and read them all, they all go hand in hand. He is a frequent guest on many National Television and Radio programs. He lectures many enthusiastic audiences, both in the United States and Internationally. Recently, he was featured on PBS in a special about his don't sweat philosophy. He has paired up with his wife Kristine Karlson to write \`Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love'. What a great idea!\\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff About Money\\" covers everything from getting rid of fear, anger and stress revolving around budgeting, by providing practical solutions. In these one-hundred short chapters, Richard Carlson motivates his audience with his own philosophies on life and money combined.The \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\\" series of books all have a philosophy with each chapter. I find it motivating to learn different strategies on how to deal with life and financial problems. I can really appreciate constructive criticism, and there's lots in this book and all of Richard Carlsons' other don't sweat books. My favorite chapter in the book was \\"Give, Give, Give\\". In this chapter he states that \\"giving is its' own reward\\". I am a firm believer in giving whenever and whatever possible. I believe this is the only way things will come back your way. Overall, I would say the book was instructive, memorable and inspiring.The book greatly affected the way I budget my money, and the way I deal with not having a lot. He taught me that you don't have to be rich to live an abundant life.I would certainly recommend this book to any college/university student, as most of us are struggling to get by!

Gerard Hoffnung was just 35 when he died, but he sounds like a portly (and utterly mad) sixty-year-old, and his timing and instinct for the absurd are just exquisite.A special mention to Charles Richardson, a totally straight American reporter, assigned to extract a meaningful interviews from this eminent musician and cartoonist but finding each attempt he makes to start a conversation quickly unravelling and thus being driven ever so gently to utter exasperation. Richardson surely *must* have been in on the joke, but you wouldn't know it - he plays the straight role exquisitely, and as a result Hoffnung leads him a merry dance. The final instalment, which apparently takes place inside Hoffnung's house (with no doors, which one enters and exits through the windows), and at which Mr Hoffnung's deaf grandfather makes an appearance, is a perfectly absurd conclusion to the series.The Oxford Union debate is also reproduced in its entirety, as is some other monologues about music and the cinema. For me, though, the Richardson Interviews are the reason to buy this set.Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"Hoffnung: A Last Encore (BBC Humor series) [2 UNABRIDGED AUDIOCASSETTES]","review":"Gerard Hoffnung died in the year I was born -- 1959 -- at the absurdly young age of 34. Today he is best known for his cartoons and THAT speech to the Oxford Union, recorded a year earlier, where he tells the story of the bricklayer &amp; the pulley and reads out some alleged replies from Tyrolean hoteliers to his wife's request for a room.If you didn't know his age, you'd assume from his manner that he was a rather portly fifty or sixty-year-old. In his eccentric interviews with the North American Charles Richardson on CD1 of this collection, Richardson remarks more than once on Hoffnung's weight and diet. It is regrettable that Hoffnung, who died of a stroke, didn't take more notice of this warning.The Oxford Union speech has long assumed classic status. I can remember in the 1970s my Dad playing me a recording of the speech on his reel-to-reel tape machine. His material wasn't entirely original -- versions of the bricklayer's tale have been known since the 1920s. But Hoffnung clearly had a fantastic, endearing rapport with his audience, who didn't seem to care that the stories he included in that speech had nothing to do with the motion that was being debated. The full speech is included in CD2, and in the last two minutes, Hoffnung brings his talk back to the matter that he was supposed to be debating -- giving a very earnest, personal view.I have to say that, on the evidence of the rest of these two CDs, Hoffnung was overrated as a radio humorist. CD1 consists of 12 interviews with Charles Richardson which were broadcast by the BBC. The BBC must have been desperate for fillers in the 1950s! The sleeve-notes proudly declare that the only preparation for each interview was a quick chat in a nearby coffee shop, and my goodness, it sounds like it. Much of the time, Richardson is funnier than the bombastic Hoffnung. Now I understand why none of today's comics cites Hoffnung as a major influence. Roll on 'The Goons', 'Beyond the Fringe', and even the 'Carry On' series!"},{"Title":"While the Clock Ticked (Hardy Boys, Book 11)","review":"This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised 1961 edition. The revised edition closely follows the plot of the original and the two books are only different in that the revised edition is shorter than the original and some events have been added, eliminated or altered from one book to the other. A man from a neighboring town is receiving death threats, left in the secret room of a mansion that he recently purchased, and upon learning that Fenton Hardy is out of town, reluctantly allows Frank and Joe to investigate. As with all of the low volumes of the original set, this book gets high marks for the writing, in terms of the language used and the level of description applied to the scenes. The mystery is highly intriguing; however, the book is a little light (just a little) on action and this keeps it from ranking as truly one of the best Hardy Boys books."},{"Title":"While the Clock Ticked (Hardy Boys, Book 11)","review":"The Hardy Boys have taken on several complicated mysteries, but this one may be the most complicated yet. The mystery begins a visitor looking for Fenton Hardy, the famous detective. Mr. and Mrs. Hardy are on vacation, to the distress of Mr. Dalrymple. The boys explain factually to Mr. Dalrymple that they also solve crimes, but they do so without bragging and without trying to convince him. Mr. Dalrymple suggests the boys take a hike to the Jason Purdy house and look around.While hiking, a big black car nearly hits the Hardy boys and their friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper. Once the group reaches the Purdy house they look around without seeing anything too suspicious, but when they report later to Mr. Dalrymple the boys learn that Mr. Dalrymple locked the gate, which they found open, the night before.The boys also learn that the Purdy house has a secret room in it which Mr. Dalrymple has been using when working on especially difficult contracts. In the room, with its one entrance that has a time lock, Mr. Dalrymple has found threatening notes. One such note read, \\"Death while the clock ticks!\\" Mr. Dalrymple has searched the room carefully and determined there is not other entrance. The boys agree to investigate the mystery.The boys also become involved in a mystery involving harbor thieves, who have been robbing ships and boats in Bayport. The boys also discover that someone has used their boat, the Sleuth, and Tony Prito's boat, the Napoli, to commit some of the robberies. In one chase between the boys and the crooks, one of the boats sinks!To further complicate this story, we learn that Hurd Applegate, who we met in the very first Hardy boy's mystery, \\"The Tower Treasure,\\" has had valuable jade jewelry and a chess set stolen from him. Mr. Applegate is upset over how brazen the thieves were. Even more interesting, Mr. Applegate believes that Mr. Dalrymple is one of the thieves.This already complicated story gets even more complicated when a mysterious man named \\"Mr. Smith\\" asks the boys' Aunt Gertrude questions about the boys. Who is the mysterious stranger? Is he a criminal involved in one of the mysteries the boys are investigating? Is it possible he intends the boys harm?This story gets quite involved, involving hidden places and characters the boys do not meet until late in the story. Some of those characters will turn out to be crooks, and others may not be. The boys will have to sort it all out in an ending that involves the boys being captured by a criminal mastermind and being threatened with a bomb!This story has as much action or perhaps more than any Hardy Boys book that I have yet read. The action was reasonably easy to follow, though a couple of times I had to go back and re-read short sections. There is a lot of information crammed into few pages. My edition in the 1962 revision, which attempted to update the series and while the update succeeded, there are a few places where the author could have provided additional details. Even so, this book is one of my favorites in this series.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"While the Clock Ticked (Hardy Boys, Book 11)","review":"This is and always will be my FAVORITE Hardy Boys book of ALL TIME!!!

Beside, I am a fan of The Hardy Boys after I had read this book from a friend. ... And it worth it, it was really.It was starting with a mysterious stranger apparently steals some of Mr. Hardy's papers from the Hardy home, suspicious events are occurring at the local Chinese laundry and one of Mr. Hardy's clients demands that his name be cleared of rumors that he is involved in smuggling Chinese immigrants. And there is going to be more action and interesting then what I just wrote. So I suggest you should check you this book. But the whole idea of the book is it focused heavily on the title that I liked and presented a fairly good mystery.It is really good in the beginning, and terribly good at the end. All people like to read mystery books should check out this book but do not forget to check out all other Hardy Boys books, though. Because I know author Franklin W. Dixon did not write just one book but many of them. I heard others Hardy Boys from him are really good, too. And in a minute I am going to look for them online.

Just consider the cover: our heroes are bound and gagged, the ticking clock...well, ticking (what's up with that anyway?), and the \\"Yes, master\\" creepy dude entering the room via a secret panel in the wall.I still very much enjoy this book today, so...let's get started, shall we?Cast of CharactersFrank, aged 18 with dark hair, and blond, 17-year-old Joe Hardy are sons of the famous private detective, Fenton Hardy, who made his reputation as a \\"crack\\" detective working for the NYPD. Frank and Joe live in the town of Bayport, USA--somewhere on the coast of New Jersey (hard to believe they may have grown up in the same town as Snooki, isn't it?)--and are both seniors at Bayport High School. As you may have ascertained by now, they are following in their father's footsteps as amateur detectives...and aren't too bad in their own right, either.Please note: As a child, Frank missed a full year of school due to an illness.In addition to their father, Frank and Joe live at home with their mother, Laura (she is hardly ever given anything to do in these stories) and their irascible Aunt Gertrude who always has dire predictions of gloom and doom awaiting Frank and Joe...but \\"is secretly proud of their sleuthing abilities.\\"Chet Morton is the Hardys' best friend. He is a bit chubby, and quite fearful--but a loyal friend. Chet, in addition to providing comic relief, usually has some new hobby that always manages to tie in to the Hardys' latest case. This \\"week,\\" however, he does not--too much stuff going on.Tony Prito and Biff Hooper are two other very close pals of Frank and Joe. Tony's dad owns the Prito (how original) Construction Company and Tony, himself, has a boat: The Napoli. Biff (real name is \\"Allen\\") is the nephew of a famous boxer--FWD forgot who, apparently--and provides much-needed muscle: \\"Many a criminal had felt the iron of Biff's wallop.\\"Jerry Gilroy, the \\"Wedge Antilles\\" of the Hardy Boys universe, also makes a brief appearance (or two) in this story. I call Jerry \\"the Wedge Antilles...\\" because I have always (not really) thought the two characters have a lot in common: We do not know their respective back stories; they only show up every now and then--yet survive their series' entire run. I still maintain Jerry has his own set of adventures that George Lucas, er, Grosset & Dunlap, have failed to cash in on. Maybe someday.Finally, the Hardys' romantic (if you want to call it that--quick kisses on the cheek just never did do it for me) interests: blonde-haired Callie Shaw and Iola Morton (Chet's raven haired sister) make appearances in this story, too.More Housekeeping: Tony and Jerry sit this one out; Callie and Iola only make brief appearances.While The Clock TickedBriefly: Frank and Joe, now fully established as excellent detectives, get a visitor at their home: Raymond Dalrymple, of nearby Lakeside...\\"Mr. D\\" is a banker, and has recently purchased the creepy, run-down old \\"Purdy Place\\" located on the outskirts of town...Why would anyone, especially a wealthy banker, buy such a dump?...Frank and Joe wonder, too...Mr. D answers the unasked question...He wants his privacy--and solitude...This house turned out to be a great buy for our banker as it contains a \\"secret room\\" that is clever as it can be seen from the outside through its window, but impossible to enter from inside the house...Yeah, right...Mr. D loves his secret room, er, he did...It seems said privacy and solitude has recently been disturbed by threatening messages left inside his secret room...\\"Death while the clock ticks!\\"...A secret room that only Dalrymple knows how to enter...Yikes!...Mr D. wants Mr. Hardy's help but, unfortunately, the famed detective is away on a case...Frank and Joe eagerly offer their services...Mr. D isn't too sure--he even unwittingly insults the young sleuths--but reluctantly agrees to have keys made for them so they can check out his home...Frank and Joe decide to take a hiking trip out to the Purdy Place, and get Chet and Biff to go with them......Our quartet of teen-age sleuths check the Purdy Place out...We get a nice comedic sequence featuring a starving Chet...When is Chet not hungry?...Some mean-looking dude in a sedan almost runs over our heroes, but no clues to what is going on in the secret room are uncovered...Frank and Joe report back to their reluctant client--who isn't too impressed with their work so far...And, no, he still hasn't made them a set of keys...Jerk......The Hardys and Chet return to the Purdy Place--at night, this time around...And see Mr. Dalrymple inside the secret room...Wait a sec! That isn't Mr. D!...That's the mean-looking dude who almost ran them over the previous day!...And...he is (pause for effect) inside the secret room!...Fez, what the hell?......A couple of days pass in which the Hardys almost (a totally unrelated story, folks) get themselves killed by harbor thieves...And, they also take time out to eat some ice cream with Chet...Just thought I would put that out there...They return once again to the Purdy Place and \\"break in\\" as Mr. Banker Dude still hasn't given them a set of keys to his home...Heck, he isn't even answering his phone!...The Hardys manage to get into the (a couple of \\"twists\\" are about to be thrown in) secret room...That \\"blasted clock\\" keeps on ticking...Suddenly, they get hammered from behind...Waking up, bound and gagged, it is pitch-black dark, but they know someone else is in the room with them...A VERY creepy sequence--especially when an evil laugh is uttered....The lights come on and it's Mr. D's look-alike!...We find out is name is Arthur Jensen, and he is the nephew of Old Man Purdy--which is how he knew about the secret room...If things aren't bad enough, creepy \\"Igor\\" (real name is Amos Wandy) shows up, too...Actually, that turns out to be a good thing...No, I'm not telling you why...Jensen, rigging a bomb to the clock--set to go off at midnight--leaves Frank and Joe (and Mr. Wandy) for dead...Unless Chet Morton can save the day..........**********While The Clock Ticked is yet another one of my favorite (in my \\"top tier\\") Hardy Boys mysteries. Here are a few comments and observations about the story:* Arthur Jensen is one of the most evil characters our heroes ever encounter--and it, to me, is quite obvious FWD fully intended this as his characterization because, after Chet does (as you knew he would) save the day, the young sleuths have yet another scary encounter with Jensen...who is devilishly brandishing a pitchfork at them. Nothing subtle about that.* The mess (and cover shot) Frank and Joe find themselves in near the novel's ending is, psychologically-speaking, most well-done. This is not a brief sequence of events that plays out quickly, but rather, FWD takes his time (and not in a \\"filler\\" way of) letting the danger Frank and Joe are in slowly dawn on them. Then, as Jensen leaves them to their \\"certain doom,\\" they struggle--and struggle!--to escape, only to realize that, unless help arrives, there is no way out. And, that damn clock keeps ticking and ticking all the while...Now, I will grant that Chet's rescue does defy quite a bit of logic (as is usually the case with all of Frank and Joe's stories--why not throw a large rock through the window, Chet?), but the pacing--and suspense--of said rescue is most well-done by the author.* Even after Jensen is captured--amidst quite a surreal backdrop with what seems to be all of Bayport's police force (further reiterating just how dangerous a character Arthur Jensen is) combing the Purdy grounds in search of him--we still get another \\"near-miss\\" involving Joe and Mr. Wandy. Finally, we get a \\"curve ball\\" thrown at us that leads to the story's conclusion.An excellent story."},{"Title":"While the Clock Ticked (Hardy Boys, Book 11)","review":"The whole thing in this mystery is just terrific!

I read every one they had in the local library and my mother was under strict orders to buy any she could find at a garage sale. Now that I have many decades behind me, I read them because the changes over the years fascinate me. The series started a few years before the depression and has continued to the present time. This episode was one of the earlier ones, number eleven, although this is an updated version written in 1962.The plot uses elements of the elderly inventor whose devices are being misused by evil forces, a house with secret rooms, clever criminals and the boys on their own. Fenton Hardy and his wife are on vacation, so Aunt Gertrude is running the house. Therefore, the boys must meet with the client, pursue leads and deal with the police without the backup of their detective father.The original stories can be very hard for the modern young reader to understand, as the historical context is nearly three-quarters of a century ago and the writing style is somewhat archaic. While there are a few aspects of this story that modern children will find difficult to understand, none is a major hurdle blocking their enjoyment. One of the best aspects of this story is that while the boys fight, there is none of the absurdity of them being knocked unconscious or single-handedly defeating a hardened criminal. When they fight it takes the Hardys and Chet Morton together to physically defeat the criminal mastermind."},{"Title":"While the Clock Ticked (Hardy Boys, Book 11)","review":"A wonderful and excitng read for all who love adaventure and intrigue.Teens will espescially benefeit drom this book.

It is more puzzle than novel; a prophecy is introduced (we know not from where) and we are to guess its hidden meaning before the 'climactic' ending explains its metaphors, the entire solution laid out in great detail during the denouement as a detective would explain a murder at the end of a mystery novel. The pattern is repeated twice more in the sequels, with no value added."},{"Title":"Immigrant America: A Portrait, Second edition, Revised, Expanded, and Updated","review":"Immigrant America cites the Immigration Act of 1965 and world politics and economy as reasons for the second wave of immigrants in the twentieth century. The Act encouraged existing immigrants to bring members of their immediate families into the United States outside of government created quotas. Immigrants with \\"special skills\\" such as physicians, and professional engineers were given preference. In addition, certain refugees were given some preference. The majority of Immigrants after 1965 came from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean Islands. There was immigration from European countries but in less numbers than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Immigrants from Asia included refugees from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and opportunity seekers from South Korea and China. Latin American and Caribbean immigrants came for similar reasons.Assimilation and AcculturationPortes and Rumbaut frame their discourse around the ability of different ethnic groups to become accepted into American society. Assimilation is the process of responding to new situations in conformity with what already exists in a culture. Acculturation is the cultural modification of people by adapting to or borrowing traits from another culture. It is also defined as a merging of cultures as a result of prolonged contact. The factors that influence assimilation and acculturation for new Americans include: the policy of the receiving government, conditions of the new country's labor market, and individual characteristics of the immigrant. The ability to use English was found to be of paramount importance in the assimilation process. Unlike other countries that are tolerant and accustomed to multilingual populations, the larger American community insists on the use of the native language of English by immigrants as a requirement for acceptance. In return the United States appears more tolerant of the practice of diverse cultural customs and religions than other counties. Therefore it is imperative that immigrants learn English, preferable unaccented English, for acceptance into the larger community. The authors point out that the assimilation process is hampered by the tendency of new immigrants to live in ethnic conclaves. This tendency is easily understood for the support value of living in a community where people share common language, customs, and history. The ability to transcend the ethnic conclave to mainstream American society is difficult for first generation immigrants. The assimilation and acculturation process is easier for subsequent generations, the rate of which is dependent on language and education. Immigrants who are fluent bilinguals have greater self-esteem and can assimilate more quickly than those who rely on their old language or have an ineffective use of English. Race continues to be a barrier to assimilation since the majority of Americans are of white European ancestry. Again, the mastery of unaccented proper English can ameliorate the discriminating effects of race. The higher than normal, two to three times, suicide rates among immigrants is remarkable and is purportedly related to the level of satisfaction of immigrants in their new situation. The highly educated and skilled immigrants who are unable to work at their chosen profession in the new county are most vulnerable as well as those immigrants who feel isolated from their families left in the old country. The inability to speak English well in the United States further intensifies this sense of isolation and leads to despair. The geographical location of immigrants impacts their rate of assimilation. Immigrants located in urban and rural areas may become acculturated into groups that are outside the main stream. Second generation immigrants attending school with marginalized social groups may adopt habits and values that run counter to the larger society. The generation gap between first and second generation immigrants is so wide that parents are dependent upon their children for clues on how to perform routine activities outside the home such as making purchases and obtaining services. Portes and Rumbaunt classified immigrants into three categories: those who live in ethnic conclaves with limited exposure to the larger society; ethnic middlemen who interface with the larger society as merchants; and sophisticates who by education, occupation, or command of unaccented English have successfully assimilated into mainstream American society.* * *Immigrant America makes use of research and statistics performed by the authors themselves, and others. Immigration data from the US Government is frequently analyzed and presented in tabular form and well explained. This work reads easily for non-academics who enjoy a technical and well research look at immigration without getting bogged down in theories and proofs. It would serve well as a supplemental reading for academic course work in American history, sociology, urban affairs, and family studies."},{"Title":"Immigrant America: A Portrait, Second edition, Revised, Expanded, and Updated","review":"for, as a quote attributed to Oscar Handlin in the book goes, 'to write the history of immigrants in America is to write American history'!This book can be read in two ways: the first, fast and superficially, by keeping note of all the section headings and skimming the text, and the second, slowly and pain-stakingly. Most people would just want to do it the first way, which is more than enough to get the general, overall synthesis presented in the book, and also to get an idea of how the media stereotypes and distortions, and public perception of this field, are false, and falsified. The second way is more appropriate for somebody really interested in the field for whatever reason. To read it this way and in detail required a personal intimacy with the subject, otherwise the text is just words without any emotion, and hence meaningless and irrelevant. It helps to have lived around the United States, and especially in one of the places with a high immigrant concentration like LA or NYC. Of course, it helps to be an immigrant yourself.The book is very complex, because the subject is very, very complex, even as the authors have, to quote Einstein, 'made it as simple as possible, but no simpler'. No reader's personal experience can equate the depth of the field, so empathy is a key ingredient in getting through this book. Being a very volatile topic, the authors have taken the effort to back their statements up. That means that there are plenty of facts, and tables, graphs and figures based on those facts, and therefore the book is not an easy read. One has to stop and consider the charts and figures before continuing to proceed. The text seems simple, but like any sociological study, it is based on real people, and hence each sentence could be a synopsis of a whole experience or worldly observation. Overall, completing the book is a labor of love, or persistence or tenacity! That explains why there are only two reviewers of this book, even though it is apparently assigned in classes, and is considered a classic in the field. I can imagine professors assigning this book with sadistic relish.Not a synopsis which other reviewers have provided, but here are some interesting nuggets from the book:1. It is known the social class explains many social observations, but to explain the situation of immigrants, add the way they are received at the destination.2. The five most concentrated ethnic groups are Mexicans, Portuguese, Japanese, Filipinos and Norwegians.3. German-Americans were the only ethnic group that had to choose between America and their country of origin in a war (which explains the high concentration of German-Americans in the military.)4. Ever heard of the 'Epidemiological Paradox'. Immigrants have a lower infant mortality and their children are healthier. For example, poor Mexican immigrants have a lower infant mortality and healthier children than native Whites.Migration happens differently in different epochs, and thereby, a book of immigration, unlike a book on geometry, will not stand forever. But to abstract out the main factors underlying the phenomenon, so that it can be applied in different places, and different times, is really an achievement!"},{"Title":"Immigrant America: A Portrait, Second edition, Revised, Expanded, and Updated","review":"If you want to know more about the United States and the real stories about the people who build it and live there, this is the book for you. This isn't about the people who came over on the boats in black &amp; white times; it's about the people who are coming here now. It discusses how the land we live in is being sculpted by the immigrants who arrive every day. I think people forget how incredibly diverse the United States is. And people most certainly forget about the challenges and triumphs of the people who come to the U.S. from other lands, and why they came in the first place. The authors clearly describe the stories of the people who make America 'America'."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"Much as I wanted to like Leonardo's Flight, I found it quite dreadful. It has numerous errors, poor style, weak characterization, and implausible plot.The text is rife with grammar and spelling errors. There are errors on virtually every page: commas where there shouldn't be, no commas where there should be, wrong choice of words, missing quotation marks, etc. There's a glaring spelling error in the very first paragraph. When I read a published book, I expect that someone will at least review the draft once or twice. I often find a few typos in a book, but this one has so many you might think it was typed in quickly (with the spellchecker turned off) and rushed madly over to the printer without pause. Couldn't someone have spared a day or two to go over the text with a sharp red pencil?The book is written in an odd, stiff style that I found grating and distracting. Dialogue is particularly unnatural, reading like something translated from another language by an inexperienced academic.Nothing is less funny than humor that doesn't work, and Leonardo's Flight is unfortunately full of it. The failed attempts at humor are like watching an amateur stand-up comic bomb on stage. Nevertheless, the typos did provide a few unintended chuckles.I might be willing to overlook editing errors and poor style if the characters and story were engaging, but that is sadly not the case here. The characters, including Leonardo, are cartoonish and flat. I felt no empathy or compassion for any of them. Little attempt is made to flesh out the characters with subtleties and nuances that encourage the reader to care what happens to them. Other than a feeling of mild distaste at the frat-house antics of the university students, I was emotionally uninvolved from beginning to end.This is a fantasy story, so some leeway has to be given in terms of plausibility. Two of the characters in the story travel through time, but there's no explanation of how this happens, other than an offhand remark near the end about worm holes. Without even a shred of help, I was entirely unwilling to believe the story plausible. I suppose some people might find the story interesting, but to my mind it has so many coincidences and miraculous events it is quite unbelievable. On the other hand, the story is imaginative and original, and with a few rewrites this might have been a passable book. But when a book is offered for sale, I expect a minimal level of quality which this book simply does not attain."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"This book reads like an exercise in how to write a poor novel. I can get past the typographical errors, as that is a publishing problem. I just can't get past the poor writing.The characters are ridiculous in the extreme. And the situations they get into are absurd. In one instance, we are expected to believe that one character can allow a car to flatten a police motorcycle, with the cop standing there, and just receive a summons and drive away. In what universe? The aerospace company is named Sparo. The aircraft involved is a cartoon of what a real aircraft should be. In fact, any 8 year old could describe a plane better than the author.All in all a dissappointment from start to finish. I was at the point of wishing bad things happen to the characters, just to liven things up. The author makes an attempt at a sub-plot, with an art history professor possibly spotting that Leonardo da Vinci is in modern times, but this goes nowhere. It's as if the author started the chapter one day, came back a few days later and finished it without bothering to read what he had written.The &quot;action&quot; more or less takes place in a thinly disguised Canada, with some action occuring in Florence, Italy about 500 years in the past. The only reason I can think of for the author not to come right out and say the college town is in Canada is he is afraid of being sued by Canada for defamation of national character.The only saving grace to this whole debacle is I purchased the book from the bargain rack, and that solely because the cover looked interesting and the price was well below ten dollars. That is the only thing good about this book.Don't buy it, don't borrow it. In fact, if you get this as a gift, question the motives of the person who gave it to you. They may be trying to tell you something."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"After reading Leonardo's Flight, I can only guess the positive reviews were written by the author or friends of his who haven't read the book or didn't want to hurt his feelings.I literally found a copy of this book, so at least I didn't pay for it. The premise was amusing, Leonardo daVinci in modern times, but the book was awful. I made it through half of it, but the abominably poor writing (dangling modifiers, changing point of view, and lack of rationale) convinced me to toss the book away. There's a character named Leo and, of course, Leonardo, who goes by Leonard, further confusing the reader. He makes just about every mistake a beginning writing student could make and he continues. He tries to argue for tolerance for homosexuality, but winds up showing his own homophobia. The mystery is lacking, the rationale for the time travel is weak, the police incompetent, and the college students depicted are poor stereotypes.I haven't looked up the publisher, but I'm assuming this is self-published. I can't believe anyone would choose to publish this and then not edit it."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it was going to be an interesting science fiction story. It is definitely not sci-fi, nor is the story particularly interesting. It is more of a mystery/thriller that happens to involve Da Vinci going forward in time mysteriously (it just sorta happens). The author's take on how Da Vinci adapts to 1980's Canada is not bad, but could have been explored more deeply. The whole caper with Sparo Aeronautics is run of the mill fare. And the author's fascination with dorm-mates bathing and drinking together naked is just plain weird.300 odd pages later it might have made a fine short story."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"Despite what some of the skeptics here might say, this is a fun read. The plot has enough twists to keep the reader guessing and the dialogue simply makes the characters come alive.

All in a day's work for a time traveling genius!Scott"},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"This is probably the worst book I actually read to thelast page.

It's not a book for the intellectuals or the literati unless they're willing to let loose and let themselves be carried on the wings of imagination and fancy. This is light entertainment. This is a book to sit down and relax with...and not stop until the last page. It has likeable characters and the plot brings you from one unexpected event to another, some of which gave me the shivers. It is well researched (for instance, Leonardo and Michelangelo were really both in Florence in 1504) and I found Leonardo to be bigger than life, both in his own time and in 1988. Also, I thought that the circumstances that brought Rodney and Leonardo together were a fun peek into interdimensional travelling. My only negative comment is that the final text was not rigorously proofread before going to print. However, I'm sure that all the necessary correctives will be made before the second edition."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Flight","review":"Leonardo's Flight is a delightful, fanciful excursion into the recent and distant past.

He also illustrates the confusion of those entering back into the dating environment, the importance of hope, and the misunderstandings that can come from reading between the lines.

That much of Rick's life might have slid into his contemporary romance, set in Manhattan.In a prologue we meet Jim Lockhart, a 31-year-old widower. We soon learn that he had come to New York after college to be an actor but had settled in, now with considerable cachet, as a casting director at an ad agency. In chapter one we meet Elizabeth Ash, a professional flutist who's piecing together a living --- giving lessons, playing in theater-pit orchestras, performing on occasional solo tours to cities such as Cheyenne or Boise.At a church rummage sale Elizabeth picks up some old Regency romances by Harriet Mueller, a genre novelist of some fictional renown. Back home in her small apartment, she discovers that some previous reader has written in purple a \\"book\\" of her own in the margins and between the lines --- love letters. By whom? To whom? And why were the novels with such intimate marginal notes for sale in a church basement?>From the outset, you know that Jim's deceased wife wrote these letters to Jim and that Elizabeth and Jim are destined to find each other. Even though you know that eventuality, getting from the beginning to the end of the book is an entertaining read, as you discover the personalities, the New York milieu, the delicate dance of a blossoming relationship.I didn't notice identifying dates, but I sensed that the story is set in the 1990s. Clues? This is an old-fashioned, low-tech romance, in which communications rely largely on land-line phones and face-to-face meetings --- some of them \\"chance\\" encounters that might make you think that Manhattan was a small town.This would be a good book to give to a seeker, someone unchurched with spiritual interests. Religious themes are present but subtle. Several times a day, principally in the morning when he's at the gym doing \\"reps\\" with weights, Jim prays what is sometimes called the \\"Jesus prayer\\": \\"Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me. Make haste to help me. Rescue me and save me. Let thy will be done in my life.\\" It's almost a mantra that he doesn't clearly understand, that he repeats because his wife asked him to do so, right before she died. As the plot unfolds, the prayer --- and the faith it represents --- becomes more meaningful to him, though he doesn't go to church. Nor does Elizabeth, except in the context of pursuing some intrigue in a church-basement thrift shop run by Mrs. Halladay, who becomes an interesting and pivotal character --- especially as she reaches past her professional reserve and summarizes her own life story when Elizabeth most needs to hear it.As you might guess, Jim's wife, Lois, liked to read Harriet Mueller romance novels. \\"When Lois took out a Harriet Mueller, [Jim] knew she was considering something that was beyond thought...She needed to be someplace else for a few days.

I, too, like to see what the wealthy around here are casting out in consignment shops, including their books and nicknacks.Ostensibly the senselessness of things, and his loss of girl in his theater group, Anna, who snubbed him when he was ten years old, hangs like a giant sore on his spirit. He can't get over the loss, although he met other women in his life.In fact, I found this book at such a shop in the Mission, as a proofreader's copy.John Butman as an author likes to go into extreme detail about clothing, shoes, furniture, people's appearances, and his judgments of people based on these things. In this respect, his writing resembles more \\"female\\" style, and I often found myself skipping some of the more extreme details, to keep to the plot. Sorry, John, it's just me, I like a story that moves along briskly.Yes, in spite of his love of details, the author does keep things moving. A chance grab at a big JP Peterman's castoff dustman's coat, which he wears about town, gets the attention of the previous owner. He sees \\"Theo\\" in his old coat and starts a conversation, then has him move into his huge new house and help him as an aide, if one does not want to use the term butler or servant. \\"Theo\\" is the assigned name.Then begins a rollercoaster ride along the rich man's lonely life, the discovery that he'd married Theo's former love Anna, that he had a grown daughter by her.Next he's in on a money negotiations as a fake \\"first money guy\\" to get other suckers into a business venture, pretending to be proferring a big chunk of change although an odd duck.A thoroughly satisfying story, and suspenseful, as Theo tiptoes carefully to find out what happened to Anna. His new master's sexual appetites are also included.Not for me to reveal endings!Only once did someone espy that I had on her former garb; a hand-embroidered Croatian peasant blouse, that she'd MISTAKENLY donated. When I wore it to a local Croatian dance festival, she spotted it and came right up to me to ask where I got it.

He's particularly good at noting the small details, usually passed over, that make a situation or character, no matter how far-fetched, come alive.This unusual (and very funny) story of improbable coincidences, and contradictory and conflicted characters, is one that provided great pleasure to this reader. I eagerly look forward to what John Butman does next."},{"Title":"Townie","review":"Good things come in small packages. This novel has its own ironic but not unsympathetic tone towards it characters. You might hear some echoes of John Barth, Nabokov, S.J. Perelman in terms of the novel's unusual set up, humor, and wordplay. The humor in particular is interesting because much of it is sharp-edged satire of the absurdly monied classes of the eighties and nineties, with their grotesque MacMansions, devotion to gigantic cars, and the need to demonstrate to one and all that they are indeed richer than you. Yet, once we meet one of these people in the form of Arthur Worthy, we are charmed by him, much as Theo, the neo-Thoreauvian butler, is charmed. The details are rich, the oddities entertaining (I shall never look at a wrought-iron railing again without certain unrelated words coming to mind), and the twists and turns unexpected.Buy it, read it, and read it again. It's even better the second time."},{"Title":"Townie","review":"Townie is an exceptionally well-written and engaging first novel and I so enjoyed it I was sorry when I turned the last page. How often do you laugh out loud while reading silently and alone? I was charmed by Arthur and Theo, lovably flawed, and by their unlikely, but very appealing relationship. The plot and characters make Townie more than good enough ro recommend, and the writing itself is a real pleasure; it's a rare treat to come across unfamiliar words in contemporary fiction.Three cheers for Butman!! When's the next novel due?"},{"Title":"Townie","review":"I really enjoyed the characters and laugh-out-loud dry humor in Townie. From an unlikely beginning to an unpredictable but enjoyable end, Townie was entertaining and thought provoking. It's a fast read but full of insights. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Townie","review":"Despite the need to admit that acquiring and reading the book was based on my being a close friend of a friend of John Butman's, I realized as I read that it is a damned good book.I expected this debut novel to be interesting, good, nicely written.... more than enough reason to read it. I did not expect to be riveted....to be held in suspense... to laugh out loud.... to sadden.... to recognize people.... to mark passages for repeat reading.... to wonder if a little bit of Alan Theo Lowe is hidden somewhere in John Butman. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Townie","review":"I loved Townie. The twists and turns kept me reading from the first page to the last. I really felt I knew the characters. And it made me laugh. A great book!"},{"Title":"Townie","review":"I really enjoyed this book - it's a quick, fun read. You will undoubtedly enjoy Butman's quirky characters - Alan Lowe and Arthur Worthy - in Townie. Their personal idiosyncrasies provide a humorous undertone to every scene in the novel. Butman's humor is smart and satirical.Though both Lowe and Worthy are intelligent, they are at opposite sides of the social spectrum in Olden. Lowe lives his life as a sort of hobo living alone in the woods, despite his well to-do upbringing and inheritance. Worthy is a wealthy businessman living alone in a huge custom-built mansion, who has sacrificed his personal life for his career.Alan Lowe becomes Worthy's butler and we glimpse the absurdity of life as an upperclass suburbanite and businessman through Lowe's (aka Theo) eyes. Some of the scenes are bittersweet, though, as they reveal the loneliness of both men. But in the end, through their odd friendship, they both find out what's important in life.I found their journey, while amusing, to be thought-provoking as well, almost like a modern fairy tale."},{"Title":"Townie","review":"I understand that \\"Townie\\" is up for the Pulitzer Prize AND the National Book Award.

His writing style gives you an empathy with the characters,and his descriptons of the Port Arthur site make you feel as if you are there. Some time later I visited Port Arthur, and Clark's writings came back. When you have been there you realise how good the book is."},{"Title":"For the term of his natural life, (The Australian classics)","review":"Marcus Clarke's masterpiece stands atop the great novels of Australian literature (the other being Robbery Under Arms by Rolf Boldrewood). The novel is Victorian in its elocution and execution but it stands as a unique work of art alienated from the Dickens and Victor Hugo to which he is often assimilated by a brooding sense of intemperance for \\"what man has made of man\\". The novel traces the travails of Rufus Dawes as he is convicted and for a crime he did not commit. The story may seemingly be a novelization of the condition of the penal system in Australia during the late 19th century and it is often described as consisting of humanitarian and social concerns which are serialized without reserve or discretion. The aims of justice are thwarted and contorted to the point that it becomes compromising and compromised presence in the life of Rufus. The depictions of characters such as the cruel Lt. Maurice Frere, the tragically troubled Reverend North, a hoard of convicts with whom Rufus escapes and most importantly the Sylvia, the woman and passion of Rufus, she who will prove to be his hopeless vindication and the source of a sinuously artful and savage betrayal.The plot is winding and however it sports coincidences that strain the verisimilitude of contemporary readership it never fails to engross and entertain, enlighten and provoke.In essence a group of convicts escapes from the Port Arthur penitentiary. Getting lost in the wilderness, lacking survival skills and soon running out of food supplies, the men begin to starve and end up cannibalizing each other. It does not get any more brutal than that if it were not for the underlining love story that dramatizes the very pulse of the passion for justice intimated by the narrator.Clarke's style may at times become but a grotesque imitation of Dickens, while at others it is transported by a the pellucid writing that sublimates the atmosphere of the outback wilderness and the disgraceful penal institution he indicts with an alien melancholy that engulfed in a slough of spiritual disorientation.The love story is indefinable and best described as tragic, humane and gripping. The ultimate mark of its ascension found in Sylvia's death due to shipwreck.Some reviewers have commented that it speaks about the Australian mind set, but it should be kept in mind that Marcus Clarke was a transplant and of British origin, of aristocratic birth, and a schoolfellow of Gerald Hopkins at Highgate Grammar School where he was described by the Christian poet as a \\"kaleidoscopic, parti-coloured, harlequinesque, thaumatropic\\" - (a thaumatrope was a kind of complementary holographic toy popular during Victorian times).Marcus Clarke arrived in Melbourne only at the age of 16. The narrative is a story that engages on all levels and it is its cynical affectation of indifference to human values that absolves the broodingly pathetic morbidity that on occasions overwhelms.The picaresque overload of the narrative is infectious and its churlish adaptation of the phantasmagoria of the wild never idyllic and compellingly savage. The sentimental excursions into pathos, as in the story of Pretty Dick, a young boy who lost dies in the Bush, and Poor Joe, the dumb cripple who dies in a flood to save a girl and her lover. These are passionate and generous descriptions of a sensitive soul that has seen nature through its most unsparing cruelty, be it social or primordial.The most outstanding element of the novel however is found in its forgiving sentiment. As with his favorite Shakespearean quote, \\"through faults great men are born\\", we realize that wrongdoings and the severity of circumstances are but the chance to venture into the farthest reaches of the human soul, when all is lost and all is found..."},{"Title":"For the term of his natural life, (The Australian classics)","review":"For the term of his Natural Life is an Australian classic, a tale of inhumanity and suffering during Australia's early colonial history.The more I read this, the more I see in it the emerging attitudes that play a very large part of Australian culture today. To start with, there is no significant reference to the Aboriginal people, the actual owners of the land, they seem to barely exist at all and when they do they are dismissed.The characteristic disrespect for authority is here of course, for there's no attempt to soften the truth of the degradation and cruelty, it's a living, breathing image of the times. It broke my heart as a teenager for the prisons that Clarke describes in Tasmania and Norfolk Island are the prisons where my 12 year old great grandfather was cruelly tormented.But Clarke doesn't attempt to persuade us with pity. Nor are we persuaded to to censure. Clarke merely portrays the atmosphere and attitudes of the period.Please don't confuse the book with the fim starring Anthony Perkins. The only similarity is the title.In the film, the working class Rufus Dawes becomes young aristocrat Richard Devine. The plot dives to the depths as the dashing young gentleman Devine is wrongly accused of murder and shipped off to the penal colony to suffer under the harsh prison conditions where he resolves to escape and restore his good name. Only the help of Sylvia, the prison Commandant's daughter, can save him. A nice, trite sample of maudlin mush.Marcus Clarke would be spinning in his grave if he knew of this travesty"},{"Title":"For the term of his natural life, (The Australian classics)","review":"I am planning a trip to Tasmania and it was recommended that I read Clarke's epic tale. It is one of inspiration and great character and describes life, the conditions and environment in which those men and women suffered.

I found it to be a much better insight into the history and mentality of Australia than any tour/travel planner I read.

The lesson that this book teaches is how to identify the different colors and what colors to mix to make even more. This book is for ages two through five. The reason that this book is for ages two through five is because those are the ages that kids are learning their colors. I think the book was good because it teaches kids their different colors.

My kids love it. I love it.THE COLOR KITTENS is the story of two cats who paint. They live in a world in which all the colors apparently already exist, but yet they are the ones who have yet to make all the colors of the world. They don't, however, have any green paint, so there's no green in the world, but they really like green, because everything they already really like in the world is green. Their reality is a psychedelic and contradictory maelstrom of lyrical color, and then the cats have a long dream about color, and then they wake up and spill their paint, and then all their spilled paint goes out and gives color to the world which we saw..wait...didn't there world already have color...? Yeah, it did. What the...?It's freaky, and it makes no sense at all, even internally, but it's really not about making sense or telling a coherent story--it's really about creating a world of vivid brightness, a world that connects from image to image in an associative, dreamlike way.In that sense, this book is a lot like David Lynch's classic psycho-horror film, ERASERHEAD, in that it's more about mood and a dreamlike state than it is about progression or anything literal. It is, admittedly, much less creepy than ERASERHEAD, which is good, since it's supposed to be a kids book, and I don't want my kids to have nightmares. Like ERASERHEAD, however, the story, already very dreamlike, is interrupted and eclipsed by an actual dream, making the \\"reality\\" that bookends the dream seem all the more surreal, like something you were never really in and can never really return to. In ERASERHEAD, the main character goes from psychotic drudgery and responsibility, to having his head ground up into pencil erasers. In THE COLOR KITTENS, the cats who paint the world go from mixing paint to a tree that magically changes color when you count, and also to dancing easter eggs.The book is lyrical, and delightfully weird, and almost biblical in its phrasing. \\"O wonderful kittens! O Brush! O Hush!\\" The illustrations aren't perhaps as memorable and trippy as Garth Williams' pictures in LITTLE FUR FAMILY, but they are good--simple and schizophrenic, straight off a Haight-Ashbury 1960s mural about the power of culturally diverse acts of community service.I didn't like this book when I first read it to my daughter, but that's only because I'm an adult, indoctrinated by a lifetime of trying to make sense of everything. Once I read it from my three-year-old daughter's point of view, however, I could really see the appeal--the appeal of pure color and feeling, oddity and dream. It's a good book for kids in that way, because it's probably a lot like how most kids experience the world--not as a straight adult narrative, but as a wild wash of strangeness and the new.If you have kids as young as two or three, pick this one up. They're sure to enjoy it, and you might find your mind stretched a bit from it as well. It's something else."},{"Title":"The Color Kittens (A Little Golden Book)","review":"My 4 1/2 yr old son says that this is his favorite book right now.

The book contains thousands of precise drawings of hairstyles, hair pieces, and hair ornaments from basically the beginning of time through the 1970s.

This is a MUST HAVE for any theatrical hairstylist or makeup artist, as well as costume designers.

Thanks to Amazon.com reviews I was alerted to this title which covers the entire history of hair (face and head) throughout the centuries. There are literally hundreds of illustrations of beards and hairstyles from ancient Egypt to the present and highly detailed and entertaining chapters on the social, historical and religious elements that influenced something as \\"trivial\\" as hairstyle. If you're looking for a good book on the history of hairstyles this is it and if you're looking for a good, solid history of beards this is definitely the book to buy...perhaps the only one. If one could possibly have any quibble it would be that it focuses primarily on North America and Europe with much less comprehensive coverage of Asian or Middle Eastern societies. The book was first published in the 1960's and has been updated every few years since. I'm certain that the only reason it's less known than it should be is because of the price which appears to be aiming the title toward the professional stage and film artisan rather than the \\"lay\\" reader who would find the text an unmitigated pleasure."},{"Title":"Fashions in Hair: The First Five Thousand Years","review":"This is a wonderfull book that details hair fashions for the past five thousand years.

I had read it many years ago, and enjoyed it more this time than the first time. An easy read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I have 2 copies of this book. I wasn't required to read this in school, but was required to read All Quiet on the Western Front. This book covers all the things a person goes thru in war. War is mostly confusing, & frightening & the youth goes thru this in what was viewed at the time as cowardice by running away. Then doing the opposite by standing firm during an attack, then fearlessly leading a counterattack. A great book about a critical time in U.S. history."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The reason I chose the book was because it shows really good about how war really was back then. I liked it because there are a lot of things people don't know about what happens at war. But this book tells a lot about it. It shares how people run away and get hurt and the things they have to go through.This book was about a man at war feeling bad for running from the battle and seeing the people who got hurt so he wanted a wound.The theme is that coward ness leads to a person to feel the need for redemption. After he ran from the battle he felt pathetic so he thought getting injured would redeem him for what he did. \\"That we two fit the best in the regiment\\". The quote shows that after they ran away they redeemed themselves by being one of the best people in the regiment. So even though they left the first battle they were in they stayed in the rest and were getting known for one of the best. The term I chose is wallowing. Wallowing means to roll about or lie relaxed in mud or water. The authors use of the word was \\" Wallowing in the fight, they were in astonishingly short time resmudged\\". The author chose the term he used because the meaning is roll about or relaxed in mud and that's what they were doing a lot because they are at war. One of the good reviews someone wrote is that \\"symbolism is wonderful, the metaphors add beautifully to the story\\". One example of that is when it says, \\"the composite monster witch had caused the other troops to flee had not appeared\\" That quote is a metaphor. It's saying that they still can't see the enemy and they they're waiting for the \\"monsters\\". By using the metaphor it gets the reader to get more into the story and gives them the feeling the soldiers have because they are picturing the monster. I do agree that the metaphors are well used. It make the reader feel like they are one of them and it will get the reader to want to keep reading.After reading this book I would recommend this to someone. This book shows the type of things that people go through when they are at war. People really don't notice how bad it is until they have seen it. I have noticed that people's lives are at risk all the time and how easily they can get hurt or killed. People at war not only have to worry about getting injured but they also have to worry about getting sick especially back than when they was a lot of things you can get like trench foot. They also worry about where they stay at night. They don't get beds like we do. Half of the time they are on their feet or in mud, water, or dirt. I recommend for someone to read this book because you will realize how much soldiers have to deal with.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Reading this book as an adult was totally different than reading it as a high school student.

However, it gave me new insight into the feeling of the soldiers on the ground and in the trenches of this unfortunate bloody conflict between brothers and countrymen.

I understand why most younger readers don't seem to like it. The writing of that period is much different that what they're used to reading today, it is a violent story and most importantly they're being forced to read it for school credit. So it will be hard for most younger readers to understand but I'd recommend that they pick up the book again years from now. It is a classic read.I've read comments from older readers complaining about the writing style, the violence and even the war tactics. Consider that the book was published in 1895, it is about war and the tactics then differed greatly from how we fought wars in the 20th century and beyond. But even though Crane was never in a war, he delivers realism. He excels at putting not just the characters but the reader as well right onto the battlefield. And, going beyond the traditional war story, he makes us ponder how we would act under similar circumstances and allows us to watch the transformation of a boy into a man.This is a relatively short novel but it's not a quick read. Take your time, take in the surroundings and experience the imagery which he lays out so well. If you've read it before I think you'll find it worth your time to come back and experience this novel again."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Like many people, I first read this book in high school and hated it. I didn't have the maturity to truly \\"get it.\\" I found it painfully boring and the language, especially the dialogue, difficult to understand. I don't even think I finished reading it to be honest.I occasionally pick up a \\"classic\\" (some that I've read before, and some that I haven't) and when a friend tried reading this with her son for his summer reading assignment, I decided I would give it another try as well. She still found it boring, but I couldn't put it down. The descriptions were so vivid it was almost like I was actually in Henry Fleming's body seeing, smelling, and feeling everything that he was. I couldn't believe that I had held such a horrible misconception of this book for so long. And even though the fighting of war is very different today, I imagine that the thoughts and feelings Henry had are still relevant and experienced by some modern day soldiers.One of the things that I found most surprising was that Stephen Crane was only 21 when he wrote this, was born after the Civil War, and at the time had never seen war. He apparently wrote it after reading newspaper articles and personal accounts from the war. If I thought about him at all while reading the book, it was with a picture of him as a seasoned Civil War veteran.

I did have to read this for school and didn't like the tests and homework I had to do, but read alone on one's own volition can be quite a fun read.

For this reason, &quot;Red Badge of Courage&quot; is definitely an atypical book and a great discussion piece. I would recommend it to most people as a good source of historical fiction.

In it, Crane relates what it is like to be young and brash, thinking in ideal terms that come crashing down with a harsh dose of reality. The reader goes along for the ride as Henry enlists for the Union Army during the American Civil War. Henry imagines for himself visions of grandeur, winning glory in battle and the respect and admiration of his peers. However, as his first battle approaches, Henry begins to feel differently...He questions some fellow soldiers about the upcoming battle and how they'll perform. As these doubts continue to fester in his mind, Henry more and more grows apprehensive about what is to come. In short order Henry's original dreams of glory are a forgotten memory as he cowers from the battlefield...From here Crane relates how Henry goes from battlefield deserter to genuine hero. But it is the way in which Crane tells it that is worthy of our attention. Having never been in battle himself, people were (and still are) amazed at how vividly Crane was able to \\"bring the war home\\" to the reader. His various accounts of combat, and of the state of mind of the participants, have long been acknowledged as masterful. Indeed, one finds it hard to believe Mr. Crane was not there himself.Crane wrote this story when he was just 25 but died within a few years of consumption. We can only wonder what else we could have expected to receieve from his gifted pen; however, at the same time, we should be grateful that he left us \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" before he met his untimely end. For in it Crane captured the real essence of war, and the effect that it has on ordinary people. Crane didn't coin the phrase, but \\"Badge\\" reinforces it all the same...war is hell.Five stars."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When I began to read this novel, I had expected Stephen Crane to take me into the Civil War completely. While he does provide ample imagery and creates a good setting, I felt that he was unable to capture my imagination and place me in the midst of the action. Henry, the main character, is delineated as a young boy that undergoes a transformation throughout the novel, but I was unable to identify with him. His thoughts and actions seemed unrealistic, perhaps because I could not view him as a human being, but rather as a fictional character. The novel itself is short, and fell beneath my expectations, however, it did provide for a decent read, and not difficult in the least bit. If you're looking to read a short novel about the Civil War and do not wish to get into the details of the war, but are rather interested in a soldier's perspective, (which is not too extensive either), then The Red Badge of Courage is a good choice."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I have Read many books in my life and I have been reading my whole life but the one book that is the best I have ever read is The Red Badge of Courage. the book is about A boy named Henry Fleming.The setting is a Cival War Regiment's camp. &quot;Henry Fleming and tom Wilson exit their tent to the protests of Jim Conklin&quot; Jim swears that they are going to move the next day.

Realists tell stoies in a way that is realistic.I have read many Steven Crane books but there are many other books by him I have to read io have read them all"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane is a magnificent novel that shows the depth of bravery and triumph. It has been one of my favorite's novels since it gives me hope about my life since it is an epic tale of a boy entering manhood and how he deals with his cowardice and then his turn point in life when he thinks of himself as a hero. But it is more than that it explains how life was back then and how America was torn apart by a Civil War and how they had to live with it.Henry was a boy who always wanted to experience the glory of heroism of war. So he volunteered just like so many other men and boys since they thought it was the right thing to do or if they were bored or tired of a farmer's life. But really it explains to us about the patriotism and how America was torn apart by slavery and than brought it self together over a terrible war. But the battle Henry fought in would change his perspective on life forever.He saw men dying all around him. They were screaming and running away and being blown to pieces by cannon fire. Henry thought he did the only sensible thing he could think of at the time he ran away, like a coward. He ran away from the gunfire until he couldn't hear it no more. He thought of himself as a coward and couldn't even think of facing his comrades knowing that he ran from the battle. So Henry thought that he could come up with an idea that he got shot in the head. But he was still a bit spectacle that his friends or troops might not believe him. I know that what Henry did was an act of cowardice, but he thought he would have been killed. He saw men all around him being killed and saw men running away from the battle. He thought it was the best thing to do at the time. Though he would be in regret for the rest of his life and also he would never forgive himself for abandoning his comrades in the heat of battle.He would half to find his regiment before he fed them the story. He wandered all around until he met a wandering stranger who said he would help him find his regiment. Henry was so ashamed of what he did to his regiment he couldn't even look the man in the face. Until the stranger who led Henry through the night pointed him toward his regiment. Henry rushed quickly toward his regiment to meet his friends and allies. So Henry told them the story and on a chance of luck they believed him and then he heard that they would march into battle the next morning. He hoped that he could only get killed in the next engagement and maybe proves to his friends that he was not a coward, but maybe a hero.I think this part of the story is the best part because this is a real importance in Henry's life since it is dealing with if he can live to his boyish hood dreams and prove to his regiment that he is not a coward but a hero. Also he will either die in the next battle or live through another day. That might be a good or bad for Henry it is just depending on his actions or bravery in it.The regiment set up a line of defenses and was awaiting the rebel advance on them. In early morning they dug fox holes out along the line. Then all of the sudden the rebels charged! Henry didn't act like a coward. He fired his weapon so many times that the barrel was steaming hot and that one of the officers said that if he had an entire regiment of men like him he could end the whole war in a month. But that wasn't the end of Henry's heroism, the regiment was ordered to charge with Henry leading them all the way until he was face to face with the barrier of the enemy's confederate flag. Henry had the Union flag and then the barrier fell and the remaining soldiers surrendered to the Union. Then Henry's regiment marched onto fight another battle, but where would it stop?This novel was a great story since it explained all the pressures of the civil war that a regular soldier experienced on a battlefield. Also that it would explain that bravery in a story is not always revealed at the beginning but it could be in any part of the story. That is why it is such a great story it is explaining The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane is a tale of heroism and should be considered to be one of the greatest books ever written.

In other case this book was a great read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I have recently read The Red Badge of Courage and discovered it to be one of the best and most interesting novels written about the Civil War. Considering the fact that Stephen Crane, the author, never saw the war but merely heard about it and read about it, I find it fascinating that he was able to depict such a pictorial setting with his descriptions.The protagonist Henry Fleming, a boy who recently had joined the Union Army, goes to war only to find he &quot;was not made out to be a soldier.&quot; Fleming goes through many trials that make him doubt his vast understanding of his inner being. He is constantly putting himself down, but in the end finds out who he really is. Henry, like any other soldier, wonders if, in the heat of battle, he will run or stay and fight. All the way through the book Crane uses metaphors, symbolism, personification, allusions, humor, and immense descriptions to help you get the full extent of the meaning in the book, which keeps you interested from the first page on. Crane was very elaborate in his descriptions, not only of places, but of ideas and thoughts that went through Henry's mind. Throughout the book, because of the descriptions, you have a much better understanding of the actual story line, and also the message Crane was trying to get across.Henry (the youth), Jim (the tall soldier), Wilson (the loud soldier), the lieutenant, the captain, the corporal, and other soldiers make up the 304th New York regiment. This regiment is full of mostly newly recruited soldiers that come from peaceful backgrounds into a much different environment, the war. The regiment is thought of by the higher ranked officers as &quot;mule drivers&quot; and &quot;mud diggers&quot;; however, they acknowledge the fact that they fight better than some brigades and are given some of the worst tasks because of this. Crane depicts the war very realistically; you really understand what the soldiers are going through, here again because of the vivid descriptions. The most reliable source of information throughout the book is Fleming, and he does an excellent job informing you to what exactly is going on, on the battlefield, in camp, and in his mind. This book really goes in-depth to show you the reality of a war, and a soldier's life.I, personally, extremely enjoyed this book. However, some things bothered me about the way Stephen Crane wrote. The vocabulary was a little bit over my head, but it wasn't bad like some other books I've read. The dialogue bothered me a little bit; I know he was a regionalist writer and tried to imitate the way they sounded, but it was a little hard to comprehend when you had to sit for a minute or two just to figure out what one person was trying to say. By that time you've forgotten the story line and have to start the paragraph over; making the book take long to read. However, once you realized what a word was supposed to be you didn't have to worry about it so much. The descriptions made the story take long and it was a little boring. I didn't really care to be able to picture the scene exactly with every little detail. Also at the beginning it was a little hard to follow when Crane jumped from one scene to the next without warning. The little humor every now and then made the book more interesting and kept you reading through all the detailed descriptions. I also enjoyed the way he wrote with sarcasm. You usually only find sarcasm in the dialogue part of the book, but Stephen Crane wrote with it. It was unusual and made the book all the more interesting. The story plot was simple making the book less complicated and making room for you to have more interesting characters without overkill. I think Stephen Crane should be greatly commended for his real depictions and good, strong story line. At age twenty-three this is a wonderful accomplishment. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to read a good war story, or who just enjoys a good book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"this books was good. my teacher reccomended it to me and i loved it. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"My name is MG, and I am in the 8th grade. I just read The Red Badge of Courage, and I thought it was a mediocre piece of literature because it revolved around an actual historical event, even it though it was fiction. The book took place during the Civil War, and it is about a teenaged boy named Henry who is fighting in the war. He went against his mother's wishes, and he enlisted in the Union's army, thinking that it was an honorable act of courage. He believed that he would be remembered forever because of his actions; however, as the book progressed, he discovered that it was much different than he imagined. In this book, I enjoyed the part when the Union, which is Henry's side, captured some of the Confederate soldiers because this section was interesting. If I could change anything in this book, I would try to include some light humor so that the tone of the book did not remain so serious, even though the subject matter deals with war. I would recommend this book to students or adults who enjoy books about war."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book follows a young man who dreams of being a hero in epic battles, like the ones he had read since childhood. In his blind dream he enlists in the army, and immediatly faces the real circumstances of war, and faces many fears.The irony in this story is excellent. This boy goes from a \\"youngin\\" as he is noted throughout the novel, to a real hero. It inspires and motivates. Although it's a good book, it was hard to get through, but I'd suggest reading it because you may not like it, but you'll respect it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"There are those who say that this is the best book about war ever written though the author himself never experienced a battle. Crane tells the story of young Henry Fleming who dreams of being a hero in battle, and instead in the first great fighting he knows runs in fear. The battle the reality and his own fear take him by surprise, and his imagination proves to be a poor preparation for the encounter with reality. The main drama of the work is then the young man's confrontation with his own act of cowardice and his redemptive acts of battlefield courage later on. This overcoming of himself, this transformation of himself is what makes the story a moral drama of the first order.Crane was a poet and one of the impressive features of the book is its poetic language.I know the work , have read it more than once, understand it to be a ' classic ' and yet am still somewhat reserved about it. I suppose this is because I never had the kind of overwhelming identification with the central charater which I did in certain books I love much more."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Although The red badge of courage is a great book with hisorical and social significance, it should not be considered the great work of literature it has been known for. All the characters are poorly developed and the story moves quickly and important parts and drags slowly through ones that mean nothing to the story.The thing you must realize when you read this book is the authors intention to show a bleaker view of war, instead of the romantic view most people had during the 18th and 19th century, and maybe even still today. Our protagonist starts out with great ambition to go to war, to spite his mother's protest. Confident he has the courage to become a great hero, he soon must come to terms with his own fears and limitations. I would recommend the Red Badge of Courage to anyone looking to gain a better understanding of literature, however, if your looking for a book that when you read it you know it is a timeless treasure, try reading Harper Lee, Thomas Hardy, Washington Irving, Alexander Pope, Dickins, Salinger, or Ayn Rand. This book should only be a supplement to an already accomplished reader, or someone interested in the mediocre."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"For a man who wrote the book in his early twenties, never went to war, and died at the age of 28, Crane did an impressive job of recreating the average soldier's experience in the Civil War.I have only just recently begun to read on the Civil War and its personalities, starting with Selby Foote's &quot;Civil War Narrative,&quot; with &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom,&quot; and &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; (about the Minnesota First Volunteers). From that meager background however, I found Crane's work phenomenal. The unrealistic view of war expressed by the protagonist, his urgent desire to join in the effort to &quot;gain in the glory&quot; before it was all over, his fear that he would not measure up when the time came, even his disgust over the conditions of camp life and the apparent ineptitudes of his superiors were as though they had been harvested from the diaries of the Civil War veterans used as resources by modern historians.I had read the Red Badge of Courage in high school as part of American Literature, but decided to read it again as part of my review of Civil War literature. In school we tended to focus on the narrative as a craft, looking at color words, meaning of words in context, creation of character, etc. Certainly in this perspective, the work is exemplray. One of the more vivid passages describes the youth in the presence of a corpse of a fellow soldier in an arbored area after he has fled the battle field. The tight, concise style and careful choice of words carries the main character from braggadocio to cowardice, from flight to fearless valour, from novice to veteran in under 200 pages. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I would have to say that the red badge of courage is by far the most BORING book that I have ever read. I say this because it could spend a whole chapter about the youth looking at the river (that's a STRETCH), but some events were just plain useless.This book was about a boy, like 1 out of 3 stories are. This boy finds it self-fulfilling to join the army, and to be patriotic and to show his man hood. His ma tells him not to, because she knows what could inevitably happen to her son. But, he sneaks it anyway. After a few months of thinking all he'll ever do is March, he is sent into battle. During the fight, he doubts himself and runs away in fear. Then, he goes into an argument with himself, \\"should I rejoin my regiment, or be a coward?\\" Instead of completely deserting his regiment, he rejoins the battle and fights heroically.Not only would I say that it's a good story, but it is also really boring leading up to the climax in the book. I mean, who wants to read about camping at night with a blank mind? Who wants to read about marching to nowhere? I thought of the youth as a go with the flow guy who got tricked by a bandwagon approach, and joined the army to be cool, just like a 2nd grader would, thinking it would be fun and exciting. I did not admire him for this kind of thing, mainly because I really hate people like that. The book started to get more interesting when the youth found the dead body, and sort of went through the anguish the man went through as he died. This is probably what led him to doubt himself on the field. As the book reached its climax in the battle, the book became a tad more exciting, as he stopped telling us about his world. The book actually seemed less boring as it got into the mental pain of war, and the anguish of it. The only time I really admired the youth is when he went back to his regiment and fought like a hero. All in all, this book got a B-, because the majority of the book was spent on the youth's mindless wanderings, and on pointless subjects.I would recommend this book to people that can see writing techniques embedded deep inside the book, because there probably were a lot, but I'm not the kind of person that sees that. I saw a symbolic death once, and a symbolic rebirth a few times. I would also recommend this book to people who are WAY more advanced readers than I am, because I couldn't understand the book without help. Also, I recommend it for people who have nothing better to do. I say this because in certain areas and chapters, the book seems to trail off into some adverse storyline that is not only boring, but has nothing to do with the book. So, if you have nothing else to do, or you are too sick to be bored, this book is perfect for you. It should also be way more understandable if you have been in a battle before, and know the mental anguish that the youth felt.Well, I guess my perspective has changed since I started writing this review, which doesn't happen often. I actually feel that this book does deserve a B-, but that is the best I can give it because I have a hard time recognizing writing techniques, which is probably what kept me from enjoying the book as much as it should have been."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a book about Henry Fleming's journey through the Civil War. When Henry joins the army he is confident and thinks it will be an amazing adventure, but once he sees the war with his own eyes he is more scared than confident. The book doesn't really have any action, it is mostly about Henry just walking throught the woods thinking about what to do. But it's a pretty good book if your into the Civil War. The battles go into a lot of detail to make the book have a little more action, but the action in the book is still very limited. The book would have been better if it had gone into more details about other characters in the book. Although the characters in the book are very believable and this helps the story seem more true. So if you're into action and adventure books , I would say this is not the book for you, but if you're a Civil War enthusiast you might really enjoy this book, because of its accurate descriptons of the Civil War."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I have not read this novel in 10 years - since it was required reading in high school Language Arts - so I admit that my opinion of this work may be different if I were to read it again. My memories of &quot;Red Badge&quot; are not fond. I was in an Honors LA class, and we adored every other work that we read (among them, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;The Jungle&quot; - classics of American Literature); this work, because it was so terribly dry, became the figurative whipping boy of the class. Our teacher, who was not one to admit such things, told us that truthfully, the only reason she had us read it was that it was required reading by the School Board at the time. Not a ringing endorsement from one who could sing rhapsodies about any piece of literature. To this day, even the mention of the book brings back the vehemance that those of us felt about it. Yes, it is an American Classic, and I suppose that every Red Blooded American should experience Crane's battlefield story. My only advice would be to proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a great book.

This book will help accomplish BOTH."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Up until a few weeks ago, I was under the assumption, that I had a pretty good understanding of the English language. After reading Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, I realized just how little about the language and its usage I actually know. It's not that vocabulary is above me; I had no trouble understanding the meaning after I deciphered what word Crane was actually referring to, the spelling and grammar is what threw me for a loop.In just the first chapter alone, Crane used words such as, fergit instead of forget, and allus in place of always. While there are similarities between the pairs, instead of concentrating on the plot, you have to spend the time decoding each word. It allows not only for your mind to wander, but it also makes reading the novel a very tedious process. You are too worried about understanding what you read, and you are unable to read between the lines and grasp an understanding of the book. This deters you from actually enjoying it.If Crane had been able to incorporate an understandable language, I think his novel would be one of the best I have ever read. It conveyed a good message, and the plot was interesting and realistic. The characters were unique, and Crane did a good job of depicting them to the reader, but the dialect he attached to them was simply horrid. It made reading the book extremely difficult.It is a rather ironic time to read about the character Henry, due to the fact that we have an ongoing war with terrorism, and there is a good possibility that we will invade Iraq. Many of the troops fighting in these wars are just like Henry I imagine. They have never fought in a battle, much less gone into war. They never know if and when they are going to experience the agony of being on the frontline during wartime for the first time. The people in the Reserves wonder everyday if they are going to get called into action to defend our great nation. Henry gives us some insight into what these courageous individuals go through every single day.I feel that you could remove Henry from the Civil War, and he could describe an American soldier in any of our wars with ease. The problems and emotions facing Henry are so realistic; that is what makes the book so popular. If the dialogue that Crane used was actually English, I think the book would even have a much larger following. It would be a fiction novel that would be easy to pick up and read, and it encompasses many of the aspects of life. Instead a great deal of energy is dedicated to deciphering many of the words the characters speak. This detracts from the realism of the novel, and turns its reading into a nuisance. If it were possible, I would recommend Crane write the book in a language everyone understands, but since that is not possible, we will have to keep suffering the way it is."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book was good, but really a waste of time with so many better works out there."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"In my attempts to read more \\"literature\\" that I somehow missed in college, I have been sticking to a list I found a few years ago. I have a very simple method: I've been reading the books in order of number of pages. So, shortest works to the longest tombs. \\"The Red Badge\\" is fairly short, clocking in at just under 200 pages or so. The copy I picked up from work was even shorter than that - ours was an illustrated edition, so drop probably a good 20 pages or so due to pictures.It still took me almost 6 weeks to get through the darn thing.In essence, it's a simple story. Henry Fleming, the \\"youth\\" from a northern state, decides to join the Union army despite his mother's objections. He's full of patriotic pride.... until he realizes that waiting for the war to get his brigade is just plain boring. There are several scenes of tired, bored, somewhat unorganized Union soldiers waiting for to see action. They often wonder if they're being marched from location to location simply to have something to do.Then the Confederate army shows up and there's a big fight. And Henry's patriotism is sorely lacking; when the fight looks bad, he and several others turn tail and run. When he meets up with his platoon again, he's been whacked in the head with a rifle, giving him a rather nasty head wound. However, he spins a tale of being shot in the head; he doesn't want to admit to his cowardice. One soldier questions him on the story but eventually lets it go, and Henry finds a friend of his among the men, and all is well again.There's another big battle scene, one where Henry really does have quite a bit of patriotic pride, refusing to give up this time even though he and his friend have overheard an officer saying that their troop is basically being sent in as cannon fodder. And they are, losing several men in the fight, but eventually they do emerge victorious, living to fight another day.I won't say this is a bad book; even though I wasn't enjoying it, I could appreciate that Crane did an excellent job with the mechanics of the language and such. What I will say is that I just do not find \\"war\\" stories appealing on pretty much any level. I think the only one I ever read and liked was \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" - which is told from a very different viewpoint. I had to force myself to finish this small book; I kept falling asleep every time I picked it up. But finish it I did, and I can now mark it off my list."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I give the book the Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephan Crane, a two star rating.The reason I gave the book a two star rating was because the book was very confusing. The writer had people talk with Southern accents. Since they talked like that sometimes it was hard to understand what the people were saying. Not knowing what the people are saying most of the time made it hard to follow what was happening. For example one of the sentences says \\"What th' thunder-we-skedaddlin' this way fer?\\" Another reason the book is confusing is because the writer uses a lot of war terms. One of the war terms was when it said that a man stood by the colonel of the 304th. I didn't know what that and some of the other war terms meant which made me confused a lot.Another reason I gave this book a two star rating was because this book usualy could not keep my attention. My concentration kept wandering off to something someone else was doing. The book was just so confusing that it was boring. I would keep reading the book but not know what I just read. It was so boring I had a hard time paying any attention. When I did know what I read I felt like I had already read that earlier because to me the book seemed to keep repeating what it said at some spots. Or I would be confused by the war terms and the Southern accent.If you like classics like this book though then a good book that I have read that is a classic but not a war story is a book called White Fang.

Every other soldier the protagonist fights with, instead of being given a name, is labeled with an adjective such as 'loud soldier' or 'tall soldier'. Whilst I accept the author was trying to show the reader how anonymous the people you fight with are in a war, it also meant that the characters came across as flat and uninspiring, and the reader never gets to know or understand them.Although I have not enjoyed other classic works of literature in the past, I have always been able to see past my opinions and understand why they are regarded so highly. I did not feel that with this book at all.

The main character is a jerk set up to look like a developing hero, only the development is shallow and unlikable. The sudden enlightenment at the end is even worse -- my response was not only a general &quot;yeah, right,&quot; but a &quot;man, did The Youth die and was replaced by some alien presence?&quot; The only good aspect of this book was that I got to write a really scathing paper on it for English, which is always fun. Suffice it to say, I didn't like it.

He said \\"use either no ornament or good ornament.\\"In this book you'll have to wade through such phrases as \\"... the brigade was hurrying briskly to be gulped into the infernal mouths [sic] of the war god.\\"Could they have hurried \\"slowly\\"?Crane's writing is unbearably full of flat words and cliches. On another page (which I won't bother to find) he says something like \\"screaming loudly,\\" and these are just the more obvious symptoms of a disease that infects the whole book. It's hard to believe that a \\"classic\\" can be written so poorly; in spite of the symbolism of the events of the book (which chronicle a youth's maturity through war) the writing style is utterly ineffective, and his metaphors obscure his descriptions as often as they reveal. Another Amazon.com reviewer (thefantasticfrenzy) found these examples:\\"Each distant thicket seemed a strange porcupine with quills of flame.\\"\\"The hush was solemn and churchlike, save for a distant battery that, evidently unable to remain quiet, sent a faint rolling thunder over the ground. It irritated, like the noises of unimpressed boys.\\"\\"The white-topped wagons strained and stumbled in their exertions like fat sheep.\\"\\"He often tried to dismiss the question, but his body persisted in rebellion and his senses nagged at him like pampered babies.\\"\\"This noise, following like the yelpings of eager, metallic hounds, increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings.\\"As for depicting war, the facts speak for themselves. It's a \\"romance-novel\\" written by a 24-year old who had never seen a war. It was written in 1895, before both World Wars, before trench warfare began. Crane has his soldiers running from the battlefield, arguing with their commanders, getting separated from their regiment and joining others.It's only 120 pages, so I tried to hurry through it -- but it takes a long time to get through the amateur prose, the vague metaphors, and the unrealistic story-line.

Such timelessness and clarity are all hallmarks of a classic. I am all the more surprised to learn that Crane created this work entirely as fiction, having never experienced these things first hand.

The amount of physical and mental strain on your body would be unimaginable. The Red Badge of Courage, by Stephen Crane, is a book written during the Civil War. Crane presents the meaning of courage through the eyes of a young soldier, Henry Fleming.Henry Fleming expressed several emotions throughout the book, which correlated to many of the things I would feel. In the beginning he wanted to join the army, but his mother wouldn't allow him. He finally disobeyed her and enlisted. I'm sure my mom would not want me to go either, however if I felt strongly for the cause, I would also leave.Crane presented the psychological aspects of war to his readers with precise detail and clarity. Before being sent into battle for the first time, most people would wonder if they had enough courage to fight. Henry Fleming constantly struggled with this idea. My favorite part of the book was when Henry threw a pinecone at a squirrel to see if it would take the hit, or run away. After the squirrel ran from the pinecone, he felt justified for running away from the battle.Although the Civil War was the bloodiest battle in American history, Crane presented the mental struggles more than the physical ones. The Red Badge of Courage expressed many different emotions such as pride, honor, and courage. I strongly recommend this book because of its vivid depiction of the American Civil War. Every young adult should read this book, so they have a better understanding of war."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Before my debut mystery novel came into current release, I taught high school American Literature for fifteen years. Stephen Crane's RED BADGE OF COURAGE was a standard part of my course's curriculum every year. It is a classic, and it deserves to be one. It tells the tale of The Youth who goes off to war imagining war to be a glorious encounter with nobility on all sides. As he endures his first battle, he learns otherwise. There has never been a better book written about the American Civil War, or was that war called (as my mother, an Alabama girl, referred to it) The War of Northern Aggression."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The book is about a young ambitious soldier, Henry Flemming who craves for war. He goes into the American Civil War and is horrified by its harsh realities. All his dreams of becoming a hero is shattered and he is engrossed in a mental conflict whether he would stay in the battlefield and fight or run away.I for myself was disappointed to see the slow moving pace of the story and I even laid aside the book more than twice. \`The Red Badge of Courage' will not satisfy those who are looking for accounts of conflicts and battles. The book mostly deals with the thoughts of Henry Flemming. You'll be able to know the thoughts, which grips a soldier when he is in a war, the taste of victory and defeat, the hardship troops have to go through for their country. This is a book for patient readers."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Imagine standing in the middle of a battlefield having to watch your friends suffer and eventually die from bullet shots. This is a typical scene from the Civil War, which had the most loss of American life than any other war. &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; horrifically, yet accurately, depicts the true nature of war. Crane uses excellent imagery to describe what is happening in the mind of the protagonist Henry Fleming, a young soldier. Although the language is somewhat difficult to comprehend because of the dialogue, the story itself is not difficult at all because of the intensity of battlefield and descriptiveness of the scenery. Crane's descriptions make it clear that war is a traumatizing experience for everyone. Although the experience may be disturbing, cowards should not be involved in war, as Henry beautifully demonstrates. While most war stories present heroes of the war, Henry is portrayed as the exact opposite. He starts out as a boy going into war for the first time, and at one point runs away from all the fighting. In time, he matures through experience while facing the horrors of war. He eventually desires the red badge of courage, a wound that would mark his involvement in the war. All history lovers and those who love bloody and gruesome &quot;Braveheart&quot; type stories should read &quot;The Red Badge of Courage.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book was outstanding in all aspects. I would read this book 50 times if I could. There were many fantastic passages, and the description was brilliant. The story of a young man in such terrifying circumstances was very moving to me because we are almost the same age and before I read this I couldn't imagine being in a war.The enricher did a great job of making the writing more flamboyent.This wasn't an easy, pleasure reading book ; it was serious and tension filled. I'd bet this isn't the only review in the column and I would bet that everyone who wrote a review is happy they read the book.I loved everything about this book because it just had so much detail and it made everything so sad. One of the parts in the book he has been wounded and someone in the Union finds him out of his regiment. The youth was very grateful but in the end he had never seen his saviors face.The only bad part was that it was depressing.

I like the characters, and I like the detailsBut if you plan to read this book get ready for some pretty boring parts and some boring details. and not to be a spoiler or anything but you have to wait a little while until the first battle begins.It has some good action sequences. I don't like that Henry (the main character) becomes a coward. But It is good for civil war fans. I liked this better than THE KILLER ANGELS because instead of showing strategy it shows the horror of battle, and how cold blooded you have to become to survive. I recomend this to anyone who likes the civil war!"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is one of the best book I read in a long time. I really enjoyed the way Crane described almost every little scene in the story. The author made me feel like I was actually in the story and going through everything Henry was going through. Also, the story is great. It shows a boy go into war and turn into a great man and a courageous soldier. I think anyone can relate to this story. It kind of makes you think about what you would do if you were standing in the middle of a battle field. Because I would not be able to do it, I have a lot of respect for Henry. He faced his fears and became a great soldier."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of courage by Stephen Crane is based on the story of one man's desires of findong courage within himself. Henry, the main character is a new soldier of the Union army, and becomes apart of the 304th regiment. This particular regiment is mostly young soldiers who do not have any war experiences. However, Henry feels that he is the only person who feels great fear towards battle. As Henry struggles with his fears, he becomes more and more and terrified, because he can no other soldier who thinks they would run away in battle. Confused and extremely streesed Henry's first day in battle was not one he would like to remember. As the story goes on, Henry's ultimate goal is to find courage from within himself so that he may be brave like the others. The book is very well written with many symbolic comparisons to the Christian religon. Crane magnifies the reader's view of war by showing the soldiers' savageness and the pain which war brings on. He brilliantly shows how Henry eventually finds courage from within himself. I can honestly say that enjoyed reading this book. Although it was relatively short when compared to other war novels, the hidden meaning and metaphors always kept the pages turnings. A book formed with good structure and excellent character development I would recomended it to anyone likes Civil War stories."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage by stephen Crane is one of the most spectacular books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Throughout my life I have een completely anti-war. I didn't want war, I didn't want to read about it,...nothing. Over the summer I took the time to read Red Badge which was suggested to me by a few friends. I was blown away. Never have I received such a compelling impact from a book as from that novel. (I even cried with the characters.) The imagery that Crane creates is absolutely moving. You are not only put in the middle of the Civil Wat, but you become a part of the Union Army, fighting fot the unity of your country. A belief that you would die for. You will feel the anticipation of a soldier right before a battle, as well as the terriffying moral dilema of whether or not you should run away once being fired upon. Crane's characters, although having no direct names, pull you into their lives through their strong diolouge. He who reads this novel will learn so much about themselves, and human nature through just two pages of the wounded man's speech to Henry Fleming, the main character. Who knew that the simple imagery of a wound as a &quot;Red Badge of Courage,&quot; would be able to move so many people? the Red Badge of Courge is simply a masterpiece. A book that will forever be capable of sharing the horror's of war to generations far into the future. I strongly recommend that you open your curiosity, heart, and mind, and read the Red Badge of Courage."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I don't think this book is an argument for the Union Army or the Confederate Army. I don't even think this has anything to do with the validity of war. I just think Crane does a great job of describing sensory responses in a hostile situation.Throughout the entire novel, I kept trying to imagine how I would react? Would I have run? I think Crane expects this question, and gives the reader the answer: &quot;You don't know until you're there.&quot; That's what I got from this book.The fact that the characters react to things differently is what I found to be so incredible, because Henry's thoughts and actions are so believable. Throughout the battles, different things trigger his emotions, and they build upon one another as events pan out. He has definately changed by the end of the novel, but the change is smooth. Everything Henry goes through, Crane diligently brings the reader through this realm. The colors and textures, sights and smells just add to the horror of Henry's situation that leaves him trapped inside, and drags the reader along."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I absolutely loved the book!

This book is great.This book takes place in the Civil War. It's about a young man fighting in the Civil War. He ran away from the first battle then learned from it.I learned some interesting facts reading this book. I learned that there is alot of blood in wars. I also learned that you had to face your fears in wars. The last thing I learned is when you do something wrong you can fix it.I would recommend this book for three reasons. You can learn alot about the Civil War. Also you learn what it was like to fight in a war. Last you would learn how it was to die in wars.The Red Badge of Courage is a very good book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a book you have to appreciate for its historical significance. Written during the time when war was glorified and considered romantic, this book was probably the first war novel to be more realistic and write a story from the soldier's point of view. It's realistic, down to the awkward slang of the lower-class soldiers. Because it was written in less than two weeks, the plot moves quickly, the book is short, and consequently, Crane makes a few mistakes.When I read the book, I found the protoganist's character very poorly developped. I couldn't picture him in my mind and descriptions of his personality were either vague or non-existant. I need to be able to connect or identify with a main character to enjoy a book, especially when reading a war novel. Henry's character merely came across to me as arrogant and mean. His character didn't change all that much and that was disappointing. At the end, I got the sense that he had turned back into the guy he was in the beginning, and became the &quot;war hero&quot; he always hoped he would be, even if he wimped out a few times on the way. And just when I was beginning to become convinced that Henry's &quot;cowardice&quot; was truly meaningful and important, Crane has him become some stupid &quot;war hero,&quot; waving the American flag and glorifying war like everyone else. Am I interpreting this wrong? Perhaps. But if you're looking for a book to show the more gruesome and negative aspects of war, consider &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front,&quot; &quot;Catch-22,&quot; or most modern war novels. This book, for me, failed to send a messege, to shock me and teach me something meaningful. Read the book anyways, but more so you can just say you read it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"the book was wordy considering it was 1 plot that was dragged out.

I have to say I found the characters much more interesting and their emotions touched my humanity. War seen from afar seems romantic and heroic for a young man when he is at home doing his chores. Up close and personal the war tests our resolve and lives are taken very seriously. The Red Badge of Courage story will touch anyone who is old and honest enough to admit our true feelings and emotions when face with certain death."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is one of many books that address fear in the face of death. Henry, a brand new and young soldier in the Civil War, doesn't know how he will react to battle. When his regiment charges the enemy, Henry defects. He is ashamed, but through a variety of circumstances and enormous personal growth (we love this in our novels) becomes a hero among the soldiers of his regiment.This book made popular the term 'red badge of courage' as it applies to an injury received in battle. It is recommended for all new Marine recruits because it examines how first-time soldiers, most who have never shot a rifle at another man much less killed someone, would feel thrown into battle. The main character, Henry, likely reacts as many of us would and many did, so most readers relate to his series of events.Though published in 1895, this book remains an icon of American literature. It is a standard allusion in other writing (akin to 'waiting for Godot'). To be considered educated, adults must read this book to fully understand other writing they'll face. Not only the allusion to 'red badge of courage', but the need of warriors to appear brave in the face of battle, to claim courage as a means of bolstering their reputation and personal identity. We see it often in political figures. I can think of two (I'll leave them unnamed, but you know who I mean) whose prowess in battle is questionable though they claimed the mantle of hero. It's safe to say that mankind's roots remained entangled with our battles, our courage, and our ability to be damaged and survive."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage, by Stephen Crane, is the story of a Henry Fleming, a teenager from Illinois who joins the Illinois 304th regiment after hearing countless tales of heroism and bravery told by Civil War veterans who passed through his town. Wishing not to be left out, he enlists to fight as well, but the 304th spends a long winter and a part of the spring camped in the hills doing nothing. When they finally prepare for battle, Henry has serious doubts about the level of his bravery and whether or not he will stay and see through the fighting. In his first battle, his doubts are substantiated, and he deserts the battle. Determined to never show such fear again, he decides to never desert again and to die - to display the 'red badge of courage' - if need be. He stays true to his commitment and in his next several battles he fights very well, even recieving a commendation for his bravery; however, he cannot forget the shame from his first battle until much later.Stephen Crane wrote one of the most exciting Civil War tales of all time; the book is the kind that is so interesting that one does not wish to put it down. It is short and easy enough for any literate child to read and adults will also enjoy it. The books twenty-four chapters vary significantly in length but have one common theme they are alled filled with exciting tales and vivid descriptions, exemplified perfectly by the first by the first few lines: The cold passed reluctantly from the earth, and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting. As the landscape changed from brown to green, the army awakened, and began to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors. It cast its eyes upon the roads, which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper thoroughfares. A river, amber-tinted in the shadow of its banks, purled at the army's feet; and at night, when the stream had become of a sorrowful blackness, one could see across it the red, eyelike gleam of hostile camp-fires set in the low brows of distant hills."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"What makes this book difficult for one to immerse himself into is the colloquial speech of the late 19th century agrarian United States of America. When you come across such dialog, I found it to be easier to read it out loud. For example, a mother telling a youthful soldier-to-be: \\"...Don't go athinkin' you can lick the hull rebel army at the start, because yeh can't.\\" Once you get past the vernacular, Crane lays out the full realities of war.This is a story of a young man, who is still in his teens, rising up to the occasion of becoming a Civil War era Unionist hero everyone can look up to. At the first crack of the gun's barrel he runs away. His pride hurt, and his body without any physical red badge of courage, he rejoins his comrades, who are busy licking their wounds. Seeing his friends' faces \\"bleached with death\\" and falling stiffly onto the ground, anger and raw hatred molds the youth into a killing machine.Crane's depiction of war is universal. That is why his work is considered classic. Stories that show universal truths, even recycled truths in a new context, make deep impressions in the human mind. Had more people read this story at the time of its original publishing, maybe the world wars would have been prevented. But, alas, two world wars happened with over 120 Million casualties. Literature is written to better humanity, but it must first be read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This famous Civil War novel covers Henry Flemming, a young man that joins the Union Army against his mother's wishes with a mix of patriotism, fear and (mostly false) machismo. As his unit endures lots of marching and boredom, Henry secretly wonders how he'll react once they enter into combat - as no doubt do many of his comrades. When that time arrives, young Henry panics, fires his weapon too early, then flees. Then, after getting hit in the head by the rifle butt of another Union soldier while behind the lines, Henry returns to his comrades falsely boasting of the bravely-acquired Red Badge of Courage now displayed bloodily on his forehead. Oddly, Henry soon transforms into a suprisingly courageous fighter, even leading a deadly charge in the latter stages of battle.Author Stephen Crane (1871-1900) was born several years after the conflict had ended, yet vivdly portrays soldierly comraderie plus the sights and sounds of battle. Publishing this book in 1895, Crane displays the increasingly glorified view many held three decades after that conflict's horrors had begun fading from memory. I liked the book's action scenes, but found the writing style rather thick. Still, many consider this the finest of all Civil War novels."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"An American classic, \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" was written by Stephen Crane in the late 1800s while he was only 21 years of age. He had never been to war. He'd heard only stories of the Civil War. How did he pull off such a psychological profile of a young soldier going into battle?Henry and a few acquaintances sign up for battle, going to fight the Confederates (though this book never makes an issue of the Civil War). He feels that he is entering adulthood through this experience. He has romanticized it. And on the other hand he is scared to death. He wants to flee, but the group mentality and his own fear of looking like a coward hold him in place.We get few descriptions of the exact setting, particular historical names of generals or battles; instead, Crane takes us into Henry's head as he huddles in the woods waiting for the conflict that seems to never come. When it does, Henry swings between shame and pride at his own actions. He justifies his every move in his mind, unable to face his own weakness, even as he watches the deaths of those around him. We are not plunged into scenes of raw violence, so much as shown glimpses into the fear that plagues a young man's mind. Will he prove himself worthy? Will he die? What will others think of his actions on the battlefield?In a time when many writers were using flowery writing, Crane takes a turn and gives us a straightforward story told with vitality and imagination. No wonder Hemingway had such respect for this classic. It's short, punchy, and in the end neither a condemnation nor justification of war, but a story of young men trying to define themselves in a world of conflict."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Perhaps the best Civil War book ever...as relevant today as when it was first published.

I believe the students are people who aren't really paying attention to the book but rather just trying to look as if it doesn't have violence in the first chapter or first two pages, it's bad.

Apart from the plot of this book, the vivid descriptions alone deserve recognition. By the end of the book, anyone with a trace of imagination will have constructed their own interpretation of what Crane depicts in his insightful war novel. I will stray from continuing on with a pretentuous review, but from a purely aesthetic side, this book offers a breath of fresh air from the trendy, fast-paced thrillers made for the common dunce in the late twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage stands alone when it comes to war fiction.

Written by Henry Crane, it exhude the imagery and language that transports the readers to the battle itself. However, the story that Crane tells just did not spark my interest as much as it could have. I was not encaptured in the text of the novel, even during the most hectic of battles. Possibly, the text was TOO enriched with imagery that it weighed down my senses, and my thoughts on the plot were numbened. I am not sure. But this book certainly was exceedingly well-written from a literary point of view. The only problem was that from a viewer-friendly, &quot;reading-for-fun&quot; aspect it failed to fulfill my needs."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephen Crane, is a fascinating book about a young soldier that first time experiences the realities of warfare. It is a story about the American Civil War, and it contains many interesting themes, such as heroism, courage, and the realities and consequences of war. It is a story of a young soldier, Henry Fleming, that had just enlisted in the army. This young men had always dreamed about war with eagerness, but when Henry sees the harsh realities of war, a great fear encircles him and Henry flees the battle scene. Feeling low and ashamed, the young soldier contemplates on weather he should return to the regiment. Before Henry unites with his army, however, the youth witnesses a ghasty death of his good friend, Jon Conklin. Also, Henry receives a red badge of courage by being struck in the head by a Union soldier. After these two incidents Henry joins his regiment and fights fiercely with courage and bravery to the finish.Overall, this book ia about any new, inexperienced, young soldier and his struggles and development during the American Civil War. The author uses a lot of beautiful imagery, diction, and symbolism to describe Henry's feelings and emotions, as well as describing war itself. This novel also includes a lot of action, but mostly Stephen Crane talks about what is going on in Henry's head.

Not only it is awfully-written, but also ends up glorifying (I don't know if consciously or not) the gruesome and despicable phenomenon of war. If this was supposed to be an anti-war novel, Crane obviously backfired, because for me it is clear that the book achieves exactly the opposite effect. Am I the only one who perceives this novel as rather dumb and reactionary?The story is about a northern youth called Henry Fleming who, inspired by the myths of the Greek gods, decides to go to the front in order to achieve manhood and confirm his patriotism (it's hard to stifle laughter here, I mean, that someone so childish and nave could exist). This guy is such a wretch that you can only feel contempt for him both for his lack of personality and weak character. He is unable to think for himself and act accordingly. His decisions seem to be absolutely determined by the environment, the keeping of appearances and mere chance. Did Crane think that everybody is so idiot to act like that? Am I supposed to identify myself with a puppet? Is it worthy writing a book about such a pathetic guy? Does the book tell something you wouldn't know before? What a waste of paper.By the way, have you ever heard about Crane's writing style? Some of the worst you'll ever find. \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" may be easily regarded as a textbook example about \\"How not to write\\". Crane's incompetence and chaotic procedure to describe accurately settings and events is only comparable with his laughable metaphors, the flatness of his characters and their ridiculous dialogues; even a five-year-old could write better and avoid the shameful string of platitudes he incurs. As most characters are under-developed and the narrative point of view is so poor and limited, you don't care at all who lives or who dies, though I agree with some reviewers who said they would have enjoyed to see Fleming suffering a painful death (I wouldn't have cared that at all, that's for sure).In short, there's no doubt that \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" inscribes itself with honours in that awful category of \\"overrated-classic-novels-required-for-tormenting-students\\" I'll never stop wondering the kind of drivels that are highly regarded as \\"classics\\" in our days. Fascinating and disturbing at the same time.You want to read a good book about American Civil War? A book that will stay with you for a lifetime? Then try \\"Tales of Soldiers and Civilians\\" by Ambrose Bierce. Unlike Crane, at least Bierce knew what he was talking about and was proficient putting words together and delivering outstanding stories. Bierce was able to accomplish achievements which Crane could only dream of.It is time to say it loud and clear: STEPHEN CRANE STINKS. Let his literary heritage rot and stop torturing innocent people with his books.Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a piece of literature that has been recognized as a classic book by many people for decades. I acknowledge this book as being incredibly insightful to the perils of the Civil War and how humans act when placed in perilous situations. I am also very aware of how intelligent Stephen Crane was to write this short novel, especially because he was never in a war himself. Yet, he still managed to capture the feeling of battle so well.However, I read this book last year in my honors eighth grade reading class, and I was not at all fond of it. Though I absolutely love reading, I found Crane's writing style to be tedious, and I disliked how simple descriptions stretched out into entire pages. It was very difficult for me to appreciate the aptitude of this novel when my main motivation for reading the entire 100 pages was to pass the quizzes and the test I would eventually have to take. I know descriptions enhance writing, but I was, and still am, unable to appreciate exactly how much detail the author put into this book.I am sure that five-star reviewers such as Karen Chung are absolutely correct when writing that this novel relates to human thoughts and actions, and I know that if I read this book in ten or fifteen years I will probably really enjoy it. On the other hand, I cannot agree with anyone who believes this book is a good read for all ages. This is because it is definitely difficult for students, high school age or younger, to appreciate this book's fine qualities. The writing style does not reflect what a majority of kids today look for in an interesting book. This is understandable, because the book was written in the 1800's.Therefore, it is my opinion that this book should not be read until the reader can truly understand the complexity of it. This would mean waiting until college age, at the very earliest, to launch into Crane's Civil War tale."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I read the book The Red Badge of Courage. This book is very suspenseful. The part that I thought was very suspenseful was when the Youth ran away from the war. The other part that I enjoyed was when the Youth started believing in himself. The most violent part that I thought was when the people in the war were getting blown up.I learned some interesting facts about this book. I learned that the red badge is blood. I also learned that you should never run away from your fears. And I also learned that the Union won the war.I would recommend this book for three reasons. first, it has interesting descriptions. Also, the Union traveled to some places I've never heard of. Last, it is very sad. The Red Badge of Courage is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This is taken from the writing of my 13 year old: This is a book that gives a vivid picture of a young man struggling to overcome his fear of war. One of the strengths of the book was how Crane portrayed Henry's intense desire to be courageous in battle. Another thing I appreciated was the author's use of imagery to make the book more interesting. I respected how in the end, Henry was honest about his mistakes. This book did have it's share of weaknesses, though. I didn't like how I felt disgust for the main character during most of the story. Also, the epilogue ruined much of the book for me, when in an attempt to make Henry look heroic in his old age, Crane has him give his life attempting to rescue some barn animals. I would have given this book a higher rating had it not been for these few, but significant flaws. My 11 year old wrote: This is a story about a teenaged boy named Henry Fleming who goes to war and overcomes his fear of battle. This book had some strengths and weaknesses in it. One of the weaknesses of the story is that I wasn't able to like Henry in the beginning of the story because of his pride and selfishness. One of the strengths is that he admits his mistakes when the war is over. I would give the story a higher rating if Crane never allowed the men to use foul language and if he had not written the second half of the epilogue. If you enjoy stories of war, I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Stephen Crane's famous book, The Red Badge of Courage, requires the reader to fill in a lot of holes on their own. Lots of details are left out throughout the book, but this is not a mistake; Crane specifically attempted to make his style of writing in this book resemble characteristics of war. This makes the story seem very foggy and mysterious. All the dialog is also phoenetically written in a literal way to resemble the way the different characters speak. This book also provides a realistic description of what war was like. As long as you realize all of this, I am sure you will enjoy this great book. This version of the book was very nice and good quality."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Very easy to read. The journey of a young man's trek through the Civil War. This is a great book for teenagers.It is about 130 pages and a quick read. If you have difficulty in getting through this book, then it will be difficult to read anything else but a comic book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When Stephen Crane wrote THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE it was hailed as a masterpiece of war fiction, more so especially when its readers found out that the only experience Crane had in war was the kind that most of his readers had: from books and articles. When readers discuss the book, they tend to focus on its two outstanding elements: Crane's use of symbol and imagery and the maturation of one soldier from cowardice to courage. Clearly Crane does use language superbly to create in the reader's eye an image of a callow youth, Henry Fleming, who starts off the novel in fear and finishes it in a blaze of glory. But such considerations, when used in isolation, tend to diminish Crane's more subtle attitude toward war and man's attitudes toward war. Crane tends to picture war in a generic sense. Many of his characters have no name. They are referred to by type: the 'youth,' the 'tattered' soldier, the 'dying' man. Battles have no geographical name. What the reader gets out of Crane's refusal to particularize the war is his belief that all soldiers in all wars react much the same as Henry Fleming to the rigors of battle. Further, Crane's use of color imagery, his investing nature with human qualities (called the pathetic fallacy), and his use of symbols (the flag, the wafer-like sun) all combine to suggest that war is so inherently chaotic that it resists any attempt on a literary level to concretize its horrors.Crane's focus is squarely on Henry Fleming and his perception of both himself and his environment. We never know what the other soldiers think. We can infer their thoughts only through the evolving view of Fleming himself. And what he thinks is that he will turn yellow at the first opportunity. As he thinks this, he rationalizes that all other soldiers think as he does. Further, he sees nature itself in harmony with his thougts. If Fleming lacks courage, then so must the rest of the universe. Serious literary critics point to even more subtle and archetypal images of birth versus rebirth and retreat versus advance in order to bolster their respective claims concerning how Fleming's moral regeneration began. I have no problem with this focus on Fleming's conversion, but not many readers question the sincerity of this conversion. By the middle of the novel, Fleming has been humiliated, bashed on the head with a rifle butt, separated from his mates, and is generally battling with some serious issues of self-worth. And then he changes. For no apparent reason, he now is brimful with courage in battle and hatred of the enemy. Further, he feels a deep shame towards those boys in blue who now exhibit the same lack of courage that formerly characterized him. Yet, it does not follow that courage must spring forth from a mere recognizance of one's own failings. What Crane would seemingly have the reader believe is that Fleming turned his life around quickly and seemingly at will. Yet I quibble at this conversion. It is more likely that Crane wanted his readers to see that the innate chaotic nature of war is so alien to human understanding that the concepts that we call 'courage' and 'cowardice' are mere tags to describe on the most superficial of levels a multi-faceted series of strands of emotions that under stress blend into one another so that the excess of one is seen as the deficiency of the other. Fleming's new-found courage, then, in charging for the grey guns, is less the permanent sense of abiding bravery than the temporary sense of fear turned upside down, a result which mimics but does not actualize true heroism. As Fleming holds onto his red flag while wearing his red badge of courage, the redness of both flag and badge are reduced to empty posturing, that paradoxically enough entitle their bearer to accolades of heroic merit by those others who have not yet undergone a similar conversion. Therefore, it is this superficial conversion of and confusion with deep-seated fear and suspect heroism that marks Crane as one who sought to reveal the terrible chaos of war by suggesting that those whom we adore as heroes perform their acts with less obvious motivation."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"It's amazing Stephen Crane wrote this at 21 and died 7 short years later. His descriptive imagery is amazing. This is much, much more than just another war book. It is, as Crane himself describes in this edition, \\"A psychological portrayal of fear\\". The protagonist, the young Union private Fleming, undergoes an inspiring epiphany. I felt as if I were there on the battlefield in Fleming's shoes...Should I run or should I fight?...what would you do? Fleming fights not only the rebel army, but himself as well.The hardback edition is absolutely fantastic...it includes the entire text - unlike the little short abridged version - and it includes a brilliant 50 page intro by Shelby Foote as well as \\"The Veteran\\" and valuable literary criticism after the text. 1st Class!"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge is a solid story about a young man named Henry who goes off to fight in the civil war. Most of the book deals with Henry's moral dillemmas, whether he should run away from the war or whether he should stay and fight. He does eventually run off but after returning leads the soldiers into battle doing a fine job of it.The book tackles the moral questions of war excellently. There ere several excellent passages that vividly describe some of Henry's deciding factors like when his friend dies in front of him.Although the book is overall a solid read there are several problems. The description of war: I heard that this book made you feel like you were there. Well I can say that the descriptions are not that great. There are almost no descriptions of the violence at all and anytime a battle occurs, it takes up a page with only broad details. I understand that in American schools they make kids read this. I doubt that's wise just because there are many better classics out there. The language may be difficult but it's not that difficult. The book is also short and too the point.Well worth reading but not the best book ever.Read Balzac if you want the best."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"One of the better books ever written that will make any man look inside himself and wonder if he's up to the challenge."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Unlike many others I was never required to read \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" in High School. When I saw that it was among the many other classics that are now available for free on the Kindle I happily took the opportunity to read it; I am glad that I did.There are plenty of reviews of the novel itself on the print version, so first a note about the Kindle Edition of this book: I found no typos or poor formatting of the text throughout the Kindle Edition, which is a nice change from many of the other free classics. The only problem with this edition is that the table of contents does not work. It looks as if it should, but it is apparently just a large image within the text file, instead of clickable links to the relevant sections of the book. This is not a big deal, but it is always nice to have a working table of contents for reference.As for the story: The Red Badge of Courage tells the story of Henry, often referred to as the \\"Youth,\\" and his transformation over the course of a few days. Considering the author never fought in a war, his reflections on the the way battles can change a person are truly insightful, and at times even breath-taking. Stephen Crane also had a talent for describing the world around Henry allowing the reader to feel as if they are in the novel. The book is quite short, but Crane does a great job developing Henry's character. As Henry goes from scared, to terrified, to arrogant, and eventually humble, you find yourself actively liking and disliking Henry through his transformation, as if you were there.There are two particular literary devices Crane uses that I particularly enjoyed and make the novel poetic at times. First, almost all of the characters have both a name and them also a character description. For example, Henry is \\"the Youth,\\" he has a friend \\"the loud youngster\\" and so on for all the main characters. This reinforces the idea that this is not just a book about a particular person or group of people, but about people in general. The second device is the way Crane uses common themes. So, the word red is used an adjective of the novel, just as it is in the title. Or, another example, Henry is walking through the woods that remind him of a chapel: from that moment there is a chorus, steeple, etc., used as adjectives and metaphors for the next few pages. This is truly poetic.I am grateful that there are teams of volunteers that put this material together and release it for free for the Kindle. The Red Badge of Courage was a quick and entertaining read: if, like me, you did not have the chance to read it when you were younger I would certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"As a British reader, I just recently read and reviewed this book over on Amazon.co.uk, and I thought I'd have a look at the US reviews for comparison - and immediately realised that this is obviously a \\"set book\\" in US schools. I can see the logic - the book is about a young person, it's short and (superficially) exciting, with lots of action, and it has some good moral/ethical themes ripe for class discussion.Nonetheless, I was not surprised to see a number of negative reviews from kids. I don't think I would have appreciated it as a 13 (or whatever) year old. The writing style (deliberately) reflects the state of mind of the protagonist - confused. This in NOT an \\"adventure\\" story, it's a blood-and-guts account of a dirty day in a dirty war. As such, it reminded me very much of some of the recent first-hand accounts of infantrymen in WWII, Korea, Vietnam or even Iraq. It's about the way the mind can obsess on tiny details in the middle of chaos - how sights, smells and sounds become almost hallucinogenic as the mind approaches breaking point. As such, it is astonishing.But if you want a REAL adventure story (not suitable for the under-13s!) read a biography of Crane himself. Hemingway meets James Dean is the only way to describe it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When I was in high school several years ago, this was one of the books required in one of my English classes. And, upon going through the many reviews below, I find that it is still a required book for today's students. But, several appear to find Crane's novel &quot;boring,&quot; &quot;difficult to read,&quot; and nothing that they can &quot;relate to.&quot; I heard many of the same things in the early 1960s. But, then I found myself in an environment not too dissimilar of the main character of the novel. It suddenly became relevent and real. Crane's depiction of war and the thoughts of young men at war, both willing and unwilling, will always be relevant. This novel is the psychological study of a young soldier and his first encounters with the brutality seen in battle (many critics have regarded this book as the first modern war novel). The unnamed battle in the novel is probably Chancellorsville (1863). The young infantryman, Henry Fielding, faces his first battle wanting to prove himself a hero. However, when the battle is actually thrust upon him, he is overcome by fear and he runs. He joins the wounded but he has not won their &quot;red badge of courage.&quot; He sees his friend Jim Conklin killed and he becomes enraged, particularly at the injustice of war. (I remember noting the significance of the initials J. C. for the soldier's friend; but, I later discovered that this observation was not original. The novel is filled with imagery. For example, even the horsemen of the apocalypse make an appearance.) This is a great novel and I hope it remains on reading lists for years to come."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is interepted as many as being an anti-war novel: it is not.What it does do is present the horrors and psychological aspects of war war without glory, but not without heroics and courage.Henry Fleming is in many ways an every-soldier: he joins the army out of patriotism and to prove his manhood; when the time comes to fight he doubts himself and runs away out of fear. It is at this point Henry comes to the crossroads of his young life: instead of completely deserting his unit he returns to his regiment and the battlefield out of a sense of duty and also out of shame and anger at himself. Once he returns he peforms heroically on the battlefield. I feel Crane's purpose in this books is not to make some overblown anti-war treatise like All Quiet on the Western Front, but to portray what he believed( and may soldiers who read the book agreed with him) to be the emotions and feelings of a soldier in war and also the true motivation behind courage and heroism. Crane shows through Henry, that heroism and courage in war is not something that comes naturally to man(or any animal, as shown by the squirrel scene in the forest) or can simply be conjured up out of blind obedience or extreme partiotism. Crane in fact argues the opposite: courage in war(or in and courage in reponse to violence) is something unatural, something that must be accomplished by overcoming our own natural fear and flight instincts.Henry is able to perform herocially because of anger, his sense of duty, his feeling of brotherhood toward his regiment and out of something deep inside himself that even Crane ( and nobody) could not totally understand . This is a great book about heroism, courage , brotherhood, duty and the psychological aspects of war. It is not a books that glorifies war ,nor it is it an anti-war treatise. It simply tells a story about war in a world where war exists."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When we play chess, what is always the first piece we give up to attain triumph? The pawn, obviously. This front line soldier that is forever, so superfluous. Never mind what happens to that inferior pawn. In this Civil War novel, Stephen Crane invited me into the mind-set of just such a pawn. He came into contact with terror when he turned and ran for his life, and sensed a crushing shame at realizing his buddies stayed behind to fight the enemy. The burden of his shame was so overwhelming that he could not deal with it with everyday terms and mentally, created an alternate reality in which HE became the hero because he fled while his friends were the failures for thoughtlessly staying behind to die in vain. But by a twist of fate, his misfortunes were reversed and he discovered valor within himself. We even see the &quot;pawn's&quot; hatred for the &quot;king&quot;, as he inwardly fumes at the arrogant general who insultingly refers to him and his companions as &quot;mule drivers&quot;. This book is &quot;confusing&quot; because war is complex and both horrible and attractive to the main character, and I suppose it is &quot;mind-numbing&quot; because it does not give the prefect answers to the problems of war that it raises, but rather requires thoughtful and patient reading. Though the book dealed a lot with courage, take a look at the struggle with guilt and duty this youngster went through."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Few books cause such a visceral reaction as The Red Badge of Courage. Every time I read it, I can't put it down and usually finish it in one sitting.The writing is superb. The themes are deep. The descriptions of battles are uncanny (though--unbelievably--Craine never fought in War). The book draws you in so deep, you almost feel like you are fighting (or running) along side Henry.It really makes you stop and consider what it means to be a man. Stands with the movie, All Quiet on the Western Front as one of the deepest and most accurate depictions of war."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Stephen Crane's &quot;the Red Badge of Courage&quot; was serialized in 1894 and published in book form the next year. It is one of the greatest achievements of a truly extraordinary American writer. &quot;Red Badge&quot; tells the story of Henry Fleming, a young enlisted soldier in the United States Civil War.&quot;Red Badge&quot; is a powerful story of war told from the viewpoint of a low-ranking enlisted man--a man who is really still just a boy. The book is rich in sensory details and poetic language; actually, the book is an effective complement to Crane's irony-laden, often grim poems.Crane is as much interested in the inner mental states of Henry as he is in the blood and thunder of war. He does an effective job of portraying an altered state of consciousness brought on by combat. Also noteworthy is Crane's representation of American vernacular speech in the dialogue of his characters.&quot;Red Badge&quot; is not a long book, but it is a rich text that invites re-reading on many levels. I recommend the following as companion texts: James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; Tim O'Brien's &quot;The Things They Carried,&quot; and Eve Ensler's &quot;Necessary Targets.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This classic tale of a young man's coming-of-age during the American Civil War is a worthwhile read not only for the themes captured in its story but also for the place it holds in literary history. The basic storyline of the book (boy-becomes-man-during-war) has been recast many times in print and cinema (All Quiet on the Western Front, Platoon, etc), but The Red Badge of Courage stands out for two reasons.First, it was the first popular novel to depict war in a realistic manner. Prior to this work, war was almost universally treated as a glorified and romantic undertaking. Not so in The Red Badge, where we are given a soldier's-eye view of combat. The battle scenes in this book and the descriptions of the dangers and hardships (both physical and emotional) faced by the soldiers may seem tame by today's standards of blood-and-gore violence, but they were quite radical to readers in the 1890's, when the book was first published. The Red Badge was thus a harbinger of the direction in which American popular fiction would move in the 20th century.Secondly, the tale is much more than just a war story. It is primarily a psychological drama played out in the mind of Henry Fleming, the young soldier who is its main character. This psycho-centric perspective allows the story to encompass some of the great issues that were just beginning to enter the realm of popular knowledge at the time, and thus the main character comes to symbolize the entire human race at the end of the 19th century. We follow along with young Henry as he learns through hard experience that he does *not* occupy a privileged place in the world, as he falsely believes at the beginning of the story. As his mother tells him before he goes off to fight, &quot;yer jest one little feller amongst a hull lot of others.&quot; This revelation reflects the feeling of all humanity as Darwin's theory of evolution began to gain wide acceptance. We also feel Henry's terror during his first battle and his later willingness to risk death in order to avoid the ridicule and scorn of his peers. The thoughts and fears running through this young soldier's mind, soon to be analyzed in more scientific ways by Sigmund Freud and others in the emerging field of psychoanalysis, are as historically realistic as the men and armaments running across the battlefield."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The addition of the sequel short story \\"The Veteran\\" and the excellent introductory essay by Shelby Foote make this a good edition of the American classic for first time or repeated reading.The Red Badge was a pioneer novel for its impressionistic presentation of war on a personal, experiential level. This is now second nature, from Hemingway's Farewell to Arms to the James Jones and Norman Mailer World War 2 novels -- and for that matter to such films as Full Metal Jacket. Previously what you could expect was: (1) panoramas from the command level and/or 2) straight-up unabashed heroism and war propaganda. Crane's method in a stroke deconstructed such approaches for good, much to the benefit of American literature.Also, the book is still a pioneer work in certain important ways. Cheap TV reporting on war's front lines or supposedly \\"imbedded\\" journalists will give you the false impression that being there is simply enough, as if a live voice and a camera never lie. They also have no shortage of glib, universal explanations for everything. True American realism, however, does not satisfy quick as a trip to a candy shop. There are things finally still unsettled, feelings that do not make sense, unresolved issues -- even the main ones. Does Henry become a man? Who won the battle? Was this truly courage? Good questions -- and the text does not resovle them. That Henry believes he is a man and has earned a badge of courage at the end simply begs the overarching questions. That is realism, not sermonizing or instant history. And that is this nation's enduring contibution to the arts which Crane had a large hand in crystalizing. Although, unfortunately, a culture addicted to quick \\"reads\\" instead of books, verbal and political one-upsmanship can often no longer negotiate its own history or even recognize its own merits and singular contributions.Crane heard the whole story set down here on hunting trips to northern New York, from his family's veteran friends who hunted with he and his brothers. Yes, this is the way they sounded and spoke -- and if you think they sound like Southerners you are looking through the wrong end of a telescope, historically, plus perhaps conditioned by movie stereotypes. Crane's sources were the rustic country fellows who actually fought the war. His upstate New Yorkers were indeed at Chancelorsville -- and their experience is what the writer, schooled in reporting, tried to convey -- not a neat history book nutshell that thinks one side or the other \\"the winner\\" of that battle. If there were ever winners of battles in history, there were few clear ones in the 4 year folly known to some as the Civil War, to others as The War Between the States -- and the continuing debate over what to call it is itself proof, if anything, that much is still unresolved.If you want fantasy, at least go to good stuff such as Peter Jackson's Tolkien trilogy. It also has some profound lessons. But bear in mind that such lessons are more readily available when you make up not only the characters and events, but the whole world. If you want opinions, turn on CNN or go your favorite pro or anti war blog. But as Alexander Solzhenitsyn stated as conclusion to his own war novel, August 1914: \\"Untruth did not begin with us, and untruth will not end with us.\\" Yet once upon a time, as they say, a gifted young American writer named Stephen Crane at least suspended untruth for about 100 pages -- and amidst the subject of a vicious war around which incredible untruths still swirl."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The novel, THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, is a book full of uncertainty. Means the reader is never sure what the main character is going to do next in the story. The reader never knows how anyone will act from one moment to the next. This gives the whole novel a certain suspense. The story is about a young enlisted soldier named Henry Fleming who goes off to war as a naive boy and returns as a man. It shows the true side of life, because Henry is acting like most young soldiers do in times of war; Henry feels guilty for running away as the battle began, but he just did what his heart told him to do. Stephan Crane wants to show the reader how bad war is, and the message he prevails is very knowledgeable. The whole story is very well written and the reader has no problem understanding what is going on. The book is rich in sensory details and poetic language. I believe, \\"The Red Badge\\", to be one of the most real accounts of Civil War I have read. I would say it is definitely one of the great pieces of American literature and I really have to give this book 5 stars for its perfection.I just want to add that English isn't my first language and I didn't have any trouble reading this book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is probably one of the worst books ever written. Despite the fact that this is the only Stephen Crane book I have read, I already have a very bad impression of the author and have no intention of reading any more of his books.The characters in this book are extremely underdeveloped, and Crane's way of reverting back and forth between actual names and descriptions such as \\"Wilson\\" and \\"the Loud Soldier\\" gets extremely confusing at times. I feel no real connection between the characters, and even when they died I felt no emotion whatsoever.Also, this book requires much more action than it contains. Most of this book is about Henry's inner struggles and his thoughts, most of which are about whether he should fight or run.Crane's style is also probably the most boring I have ever encountered. It is like a dull monotone, and I found myself dropping off to sleep as I read this.Do not read this book, much less buy it, if you can help it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I really did not enjoy this book because it was very bland and everything had to have a description after it. I thin you should just stick to the basic ideas and express one clear thought in order to have a good story."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Stephen Crane has written an excellent work in The Red Badge of Courage. This book takes place in a period of two days, giving Crane plenty of room to expand on his themes and go into great detail. This book catches the reader's attention by presenting the Civil War in such great detail that the reader cannot help but picture the scenes in their own mind.The Red Badge of Courage tells the story of a youthful boy, Henry Flemming, who goes to war. After many rumors of battle cause Henry to doubt his courage when faced with battle, Henry's group finally goes into battle. Henry does not run away during the fighting, and gains confidence. However, the second battle that he sees causes him to flee. The rest of the story tells of How Henry comes to terms with his fear, and eventually returns to the battle line.The only complaint that any reader could have is that Crane uses almost too much detail. Because there is so much detail, the reader could loose track of the plot. The great detail is, however, what makes this such an outstanding book.

Henry is a farm lad from New York who has left behind a mother who laments his leaving for the army. On the first day of battle the boy runs away but he later redeems himself with heroism under fire. Irony reigns as he is hit on the head by a fleeing soldier! The wound from that blow is his red badge of courage! His best friend in the regiment Jim Conklin is killed by a horrific wound. Henry survives the battle. The short novel shows us the cruelty of war. Soldiers are merely pawns while the heavens look on with indifference to the plight of suffering humanity. Crane believed in social darwinism; the world is a harsh place where only the strong and lucky survive. Crane was the son of a New Jersey Methodist minister but his universe is godless.This masterpiece of American literature was praised by Ernest Hemingway and filmed by John Huston with war hero Audie Murphy in the role of Henry Fleming. It is an essential of war fiction and a brutal look at warfare.Other stories are included in this Penguin Edition:1. The Veteran-this short story records the death of the aged Henry Fleming. He is living on a farm and dies in an attempt to save his ponies when his barn burns to the ground. The story says the battle Henry was involved in during the Civil War was Chancellorsville.2. The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky tells of a lawman who has returned to a Western town with a wife. Gunman Scratchy Wilson refuses to fight lawman Potter as the story concludes.3. The Blue Hotel revolves around a cheating at cards incident in a Western town in Nebraska.4. A Self Made Man is a parody of a Horatio Alger Story.5. The Open Boat is a tale of survival. A captain, cook, oiler and journalist are castaways from a sinking boat off the Florida coast. They must work together to survive against the backdrop of uncaring and indifferent nature."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Stephen Crane's best-known work remains singularly powerful more than a century after publication, a remarkably vivid acid-trip-like ride told in a grippingly naturalistic way. The product of a man in his mid-20s who had never been closer to war than military school and veteran's parades, \\"Red Badge Of Courage\\" captures both the lulls and terrors of combat as experienced in the Civil War.Henry Fleming is a young man newly recruited to the Union cause. When his regiment, the 304th New York, is put on the front line, the youth recoils from a strong Confederate attack and finds himself wandering the broken hinterlands of the battlefield. As the war around him continues, another war goes on inside Henry as he tries to convince himself he is not a coward. But only battle will restore his sense of self.The edition I read is billed as the \\"only complete edition\\", from Crane's original manuscript. People who complain that the later final edition is too purple for its own good would probably dislike this even more. There's more of Fleming's internal struggle, and more adjectives. Certainly editing had its advantages. I don't think one of \\"Red Badge's\\" most famous lines benefits from the adjective \\"fierce\\", as in \\"The red sun was pasted in the sky like a fierce wafer.\\"But there are compensatory benefits to this editions. While narrating Henry's various self-justifications for his running away from battle, some of which have a ring of meretricious substance about them, there is this nice line, excised from the final text: \\"...he peers into the core of things and sees that the judgment of man is thistle-down in wind\\".Editor Henry Binder overstates how much of the editing was to the novel's detriment, arguing that it obscures Crane's message of Fleming as a badly-flawed character only made worse after answering Mars' call to duty at last. Fleming doesn't strike me as guilty of more than being a kid in a tricky situation, out on his own for the first time in the most testing of circumstances. I've never been to war, but I identified with the highly vivid journey of self-discovery Henry takes. It's to Crane's credit he keeps so much of Fleming under the table, even barely referencing him by name. That way he becomes an everyman, and a reader surrogate.What kind of takeaway does Crane desire from his readers? Was it, to echo a title of a later Crane poem, that \\"War is kind\\"? \\"He had fought like a pagan who defends his religion,\\" Crane writes of Fleming. \\"Regarding it, he saw that it was fine, wild, and, in some ways, easy.\\"Yet you also get vividly horrific descriptions of dead bodies reeking in the sun, and senseless death and suffering.Ultimately Crane probably saw war as a natural byproduct of humanity and an uncaring universe, neither good nor bad. It's a limited philosophical construct, perhaps, but one that \\"Red Badge\\" makes a case for in bold, unforgettable hues."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"What can one truly say about an American Classic. It would be presumptuous on my part, at the very least, to analyze Mr. Crane's masterpiece after so many literary giants have already poked and prodded this novel of youth and war to ad nauseam. As a young boy in the early 1950s, I first read this novel and enjoyed the superficial battle narratives. Later as a college student in the 1960s, I again was treated to an analysis of this great work by a distinguished university professor. Needless to say he dug deep into the meaning of this and that and what Mr. Crane was \\"really\\" saying. Academia arrogance always amuses me. As I grew older, and not necessarily wiser, I grew to enjoy reading about the American Civil War more and more. Today in my 60s I guess you could say I am a Civil War buff as I have read about and visited most civil war battlefields and sites. The one thing that keeps coming back, and to me grows more interesting with each passing year, is the life and views of the common soldier. When the smoke clears away, and the generals have gone, it is the essence of the common soldier that remains. It is he, or she, that was the spirit of the battles. In this light Mr. Crane captured that elusive spirit.Today, I periodically reread The Red Badge of Courage to feel and taste what those common soldiers saw and felt. Although Mr. Crane did not actually serve in the Civil War, he was not born until 1871, his narrative nevertheless captures the flavor of those horrific times.It is a simple book about a young boy growing up during a terrible war. As the pure, innocent young boy leaves his mom and trudges off to find glory in war, he soon discovers that war is anything but glory. It is dirty, messy, bloody, lonely, and at times, most times, terrifying. He must confront his demons as the guns roar and find out who he really is. During his first encounter of battle, the boy simply runs away terrified. He agonizes over his cowardice. He longs to return to his unit but is afraid of what his mates will think of his running away. Then he is struck in the head by a rifle from another soldier and realizes he can return and claim a battle injury. So he returns and is hailed a hero. In his heart he sadly knows the truth and during a second battle redeems himself in glory. The story concludes with his realization that there is no glory in war or death and sadness. Despite this he rejoices to be among his comrades.A simple story that brings home the horrors of war and the truth of glory. Again, an American classic and a must read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When the young boy, Henry, heard of a near by recruiting center for the Civil War he decided to join immediately. Despite what Henry's mother told him he enlisted with the North in hopes of an adventure and a good time. The war turned out to be much different than he could have expected because days after he joined the Union Army his regiment began a march south towards battle. After hearing different opinions about the war life Henry shakes with fear for how he would react on the battlefield. The war enfolds as Henry finds himself completely shocked to be in his first battle. Once he got wounded he desperately retreated and later joined up with another regiment, which had some of his friends in it from his original regiment. Henry toughens up when his new regiment is sent into another battle. He made a great influence on his regiment to fight and win their battle. The war came to an end and Henry looked back on his accomplishments with a smile. The Red Badge of Courage is an excellent book filled with plenty action, details and well thought out characters to fit their time period.Many books begin their stories with just a boring introduction to introduce the characters and setting but in the Red Badge of Courage there was action from the first chapter until the last chapter. The book began with Henry immediately enlisting with the Union Army within the first couple of pages and following that event was Henry's regiment's march south. Henry fought in two battle and several small fights during his adventure. He went through many adventures to finally make himself proud. The key battle Henry took place in was the battle where he carried his regiment's flag into battle, which made all of the other soldiers follow him to glory.Stephen Crane described all of the key elements of the story very well to give the reader a clear image of what was occurring as they were reading. \\"The thick fog was layering the field as distant lights could be seen followed by a blast\\" was an example of the description of the battles in the story. He also explained daily camp life during the war, which seemed to be accurate with the actual war. Crane described what the camps looked like and all of the various things the soldiers were doing to entertain themselves such as playing music, cards, and even fighting sometimes.Henry, Jim and Wilson who are the three main characters were described very well within the story. Crane described their personality through how they act. Jim responded to Henry that if the regiment retreated he would also but if the regiment stayed and fought he would do the same. Jim is the kind of guy that likes getting the job done and not complain too much about it but still have opinions on the matters. Wilson began the war as a loud soldier who argues a lot and then suddenly changed into a quiet soldier realizing the horrors of battle. He settled down into a quieter person and began fearing death and the war. The main character of the story, Henry, was an adventurous boy in the beginning of the story that was searching for action and found it but more than he could handle causing him to change into a coward. He transformed back into an adventurous boy again and led his regiment into battle.The Red Badge of Courage was a well-written book about the life of a single Union solider who transformed himself during his experiences during the war. Anyone who enjoys action books about war should undoubtedly read this book. Stephen Crane constructed a masterpiece that everyone should read. Each page is filled with a surprise and action to make the story one of the most thrilling novels I've ever read.-k hurdle"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"chancellorsville is right here outside my windows, and the rappahannock just past the pine grove. when i walk over to the fields that crane sets you in, the ground resonates with the shadowy movements of his scenes. his incredible sense of time &amp; place lives a century or so later. what other books can do the same? red badge defines a moment and it defines us. what more can anyone ask?"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"A book chock full of wartime struggle, its great...if you like that sort of thing.

This is not a book about anything except war and one boy's attempt to endure it. The criticisms of Crane's characters being &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;nameless&quot; are true only in the sense that he gives them no discernable identity--the only things discernable in war are the exchanges of gunfire and death, which Crane's soldiers meet. Life is not a splendor; it is a charnal on the battlefield. As for Crane's style, the only valid point that I believe has to be made is that Crane had an imperfect sense of grammar: but what does it matter--who in our world today could write the definitive novel on war in English? Who could write this passage, one of the most beautiful opening paragraphs in the language: &quot;The cold passed reluctantly from the earth, and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting. As the landscape changed from brown to green, the army awakened and began to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors. It cast its eyes upon the roads, which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper thoroughfares. A river, amber-tinted in the shadows of its banks, purled at the army's feet; and at night, when it had become of a sorrowful blackness, one could see across it the red, eye-like gleams of hostile campfires set in the low brows of distant hills. . . . &quot; This, fellow readers, I hope, will rectify these ignorant condemnations of Crane's masterwork (The above passage was memorized, by the way; if any of you are unbelieving, check a copy of The Red Badge or e-mail me: I can try again if there are any mistakes in punctuation or--hopefully not!--a misplaced word."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The literary significance of Stephan Crane's &quot;Red Badge of Courage&quot; is best understood by examining the historical context of its original publication. By 1895 the Civil War had retreated into a gauzy curtain of heroic myth and legend. Those veterans who experienced the horrors of war and might have drawn back the curtain of romantic illusion were, by 1895, themselves subject to the softening gloss of time. The world had yet experienced the &quot;Great War&quot; of 1914, which stripped the world of its innocence. Steven Crane's work was the lone voice of anti-war sentiment at that period of American history. The advent of the visual media has brought war into clearer focus to us of the late 20th century. Stephen Crane broke loose of late 18th century conventions and thereby forged a new direction in literature. It is this historical context that distinguishes and elevates &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; to an American classic."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Red Badge of Courage is a civil war period novel using visual imagery and battles as metaphors for the maturing of a young soldier. Though considered a must-read classic, this short novel is overwhelmed with description and is confusing in indentifying characters (some simply have names such as the &quot;tall man&quot;)."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a beautifully visual novel in that stark images abound in almost every sentence. In fact, the novel is poetry as much as it is prose. But it is also an American classic as a story. It is indeed remarkable that Crane never went to battle. I haven't either but I can't help but be convinced that men going into battle think as they do in The Red Badge of Courage. In addition, Crane's command of the English language is just that, commanding. Any literate being will find it very easy to follow and understand. Just stick your nose in it. The sentence structures are as straight forward. Read it if you enjoy masterpieces. Only one whose attention span and imagination has been warped by television will consider it boring. The novel is so short and tightly written that it can't fail to be gripping"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Through Henry's eyes the reader sees the emotions running through a soldier's mind. The reader learns about the main components of the war, which are war, fear, courage, and comradeship.War is like the grim reaper, who sucks up lives of people whole. War is enabled by hatred against a fellow man.Fear is an emotion that helps us understand what war is really. Through fear we realize that war takes away lives. Fear also brings upon the idea of survival. &quot;Cowards die a thousand deaths, but the brave die only once.&quot;A war cannot be fought if there was not a person brave enough to fight it. Henry shows his courage by holding the flag in the front of the regiment in the last battle fought.Comradeship is another main theme in the novel. A war is based upon comradeship. When a person fights a war, he is part of an army. An army where soldiers help each other for the good of their side.When these four themes are combined, they bring the idea of war. War is a monster, it is a path used to solve difficult problems. It is a substitute for compromise."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"A Review by TaylorThe Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane is about young Henry Flemming, who joins the Union Army during the Civil War. He thought he would join the army, prove his courage and manhood, and return home honorably. But from the start of his first battle, he is confronted with all of his fears and inner conflicts. This book is mainly about the transformation Henry goes through, his courage and cowardice, his pride and self-pity as he fights in this country's bloodiest conflict of all time.In my opinion, this book is horrible and extremely overrated. Crane usually identifies the characters using characteristics such as the youth, the tall soldier, and the bearded officer, which makes it difficult to follow and understand at times. The dialogue was also very difficult to understand. Crane really failed at his attempt to write dialogue in the way people talk, often overdoing accents. One example is in the twelfth chapter where a soldier said, \\"Thunder, I wish we was sure 'a findin' our reg'ments t'night. It's goin' t' be long huntin'. But I guess we kin do it.\\" Dialogue like this is very common in the book and it makes it difficult to comprehend and take in. I sometimes had to stop and read a paragraph over again to understand what the person was saying. The One thing that I liked about the book is Crane's descriptions and metaphors. A good example of this is when he wrote, \\"The ground was cluttered with vines and bushes, and the trees grew close and spread out like bouquets...The creepers, catching against his legs, cried out harshly as their sprays were torn from the barks of trees.\\" I generally liked his writing style, though I recall numerous times when his descriptions were rather dull and difficult to understand.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone really.

The plot slows down towards the middle of the story but catches your attention again in the conclusion. At times the battle drones on and left me wondering what had happened. This story is quite simple, but through Crane's ability to depict the battle scenes and the emotions of the soldiers, it becomes very interesting. I think there could have been a more intricate plot with more fighting and fewer of the unnecessary facts on Henry's past and his moral struggle. I enjoy war stories and see this as a true classic.

Crane's language is very simple - appropriate for eighth-graders, mixed with far more challenging dialect. The story is at once obvious and chaotic - a metaphor for the war it depicts. The settings are depicted in the same manner, with a mix of fine detail and battle-obscured backdrops.The story's protagonist, Henry Fleming, is a mixed bag as well. His mental evolution through his first battles is the main thrust of the book, and is every bit as challenging and chaotic as the situations as he finds himself in.This is a book you really have to dig into in order to find the gems - a superficial reading will not suffice. The language is plain, while the story difficult to follow but not particularly novel. The worth of the book is contained in its metaphor, which appears at several levels, but has to be actively searched for. If this style of reading is for you, this is an excellent book.

Steven Crane is trying to get an idea across to the reader that life is not always the way that you would like it to be, or what you thought it would be when you first went into a certain experience. I was required to read this novel for school and found it a very good contrast of Henry David Thoreau's work in Walden. Nathaniel Hawthorne has the same ideas behind Steven Crane's writing.

The novel by Stephen Crane, while having extensive and descriptive figurative language, lacked a thorough plot, one with a beginning, middle, and end. I suggest to the reader if they want to get any pleasure out of it, to read it on a very superficial and shallow level. Reading it for school only takes away from the book and causes the student to become distracted with the pointing out of all the figurative language and color descriptions.

The pawn, of course. The front line soldier that is always expendable. I am not that great a chess player but in my somewhat lacking strategies, I have even often used my pawn as bait to try and draw out my opponent's &quot;more valuable&quot; pieces into a trap. Nevermind what happens to that poor pawn.In this Civil War novel, Stephen Crane invites us into the mind of just such a pawn. We see that he is not a mindless toy soldier, but an enlightened young man full of optimism and bravado, with family and friends back home and dreams of glory. We also see that as he is exposed to the dreadful realities of combat, he is all too human. He experiences fear as he turns and runs for his life, and senses a crushing shame at realizing his buddies stayed behind to fight. The burden of his shame is so oppressive that he can't deal with it in mundane terms and mentally creates an alternate reality in which HE is the hero because he retreated while his friends are the failures for foolishly staying behind to die in vain. But by a twist of fate, his misfortunes are reversed and he discovers courage within himself that he feared didn't exist. Crane shows us this by taking us into battle so that we witness how this mortal young man deals with the stress of combat and finds inner strength by focusing on his task and nothing else, not even the possibility of his own death. We even see the &quot;pawn's&quot; hatred for the &quot;king&quot;, as he inwardly fumes at the arrogant general who insultingly refers to him and his companions as &quot;mule drivers&quot;. Next time you watch a Civil War film and you see soldiers topple over by the hundreds with each volley fired by the other side, remember this example of the nameless infantryman who, despite not being a celebrated general in all the newspaper stories, is indeed a human being with dreams and desires and intelligent thoughts who has to be the actual one to lay all that on the line by fighting the battle.Kudos to Mr. Crane, who wrote this book despite being born after the Civil War, for having a keen ear to the stories of the common footsoldiers who, as veterans, gave him a vivid glimpse of what it is like to be sent into battle by men on horses who didn't really care whether they lived or died."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The red badge of corage is a good book that is about a war.

Crane presented the psychological aspects of war to his readers with precise detail and clarity.

My favorite part of the book was when Henry threw a pinecone at a squirrel to see if it would take the hit, or run away. After the squirrel ran from the pinecone, he felt justified for running away from the battle. Although the Civil War was the bloodiest battle in American history, Crane presented the mental struggles more than the physical ones. The Red Badge of Courage expressed many different emotions such as pride, honor, and courage. I strongly recommend this book because of its vivid depiction of the American Civil War.

He came from hot plowshares to prospects of clover tranquilly, and it was as if hot plowshares were not. Scars faded as flowers.&quot; Perhaps not the best quote, but it is at least a taste of the work of art that is The Red Badge of Courage. It has been suggested that this book lacks plot, that it is boring. I would count those who consider this boring amoung the numbers of people who would find an art museum dull. It has also been suggested that the main character, Henry, referred to as &quot;the youth,&quot; is a coward. Anyone who could say that obviously did not read this book through to the end.

Henry is a boy, still in his teens when he decides to enlist. We follow him through his introduction to army life and through his first two days of battle.I enjoyed this novel, even though I was not very fond of Henry himself. I think Stephen Crane gave a great account of what it was like for a young soldier during the war. He starts with Henry worrying if he will be brave enough to actually take place in a battle, or will he run when confronted with the enemy. Once a battle begins, we see the confusion that occurs with all of the noise and smoke. Mr. Crane also brings out the isolation of each division and how they can not see the \\"big picture\\". The dialog is authentic and does not disrupt the lyrical flow of Mr. Crane's story-telling. I found it a beautiful telling of a not so beautiful subject. This story is not romanticized, nor does it espouse ideals or beliefs of the two warring factions. I think this is an fantastic book to be read by everyone, especially those who have not read much about the Civil War.4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is an extraordinary book. Written more than a century ago by a man who never went to war, it captures the full horror of modern combat with total realism. The US Civil War was the first conflict to be fought as an extended campaign by massed armies deploying modern artillery to devastating effect. It created killing fields on a scale only matched fifty years later in WWI. Every student of history wonders what goes through the minds of young men living through such slaughter. Stephen Crane gives us a very good idea as he tracks the experience of a raw recruit through two days of battle. The story is simple and human, quickly told. This is no glory tale. If it celebrates anything, it is the heroism of small acts of comradeship and the sacrifice of ordinary men surviving moments of hell. Somehow, the human spirit endures. The larger rhythms of life regain their pattern and birdsong returns to the shattered battlefields, putting a seal of some kind on such tragic loss"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Red Badge of Courage is a descriptive narration of one youth's first battle experience during the Civil War. This book deals with a dark time in American History and the writer treats it as such. The detail is stark, bleak and Crane doesn't sugar coat anything.I'm not disappointed that I finally picked this up and read it. It is a very short novel and doesn't take much of a time commitment to read. I did however find it dragging in parts and it took me a while to get into it. Henry, the youth, of the novel is a fairly simple individual who is shown the ugly face of war and his reactions to his first experiences are what the book is about.All in all, this is a good book, but nowhere near great. I'm not a big fan of Crane's style in his storytelling, however he does paint a vivid picture and the reader gets a clear idea of what it may have been like to be an unwitting youth going into battle for the first time with little training or warning of what to expect."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This is a great book on the horrors and the trials of life in the civil war.

It starts out with a young boy named Henry Fleming who wants to join the army against his mother's whishes. After some persuading he heads off in to a frightening new world. The book shows the horrors of war, and what men go through when going to war. I did enjoy this book because of its anti-war message. I think it clearly states what war can do to a person and how it is overall wrong. The descriptions of the battle scenes were excellently done and kept my attention. The battles were always action packed but Crane points out how it deeply affects Henry. It really shows the horror of war, and that helped me get through it. Otherwise the book was slow and sometimes boring. I found it somewhat repetitive and I wasn't able to keep my full attention on it. But the message overall was one that I enjoyed. It helped me get a perspective from a teenager in war and how it changed him, the different attitudes of men in war, and what the Civil War might have been like. It's a good book but has its dry moments. If you like reading novels that deal with war and its consequences then this is right for you. But its a little tough to read and can be boring, so it's not for everyone. But I think that everyone should read this book one time or another. It's an American classic that shows the reality of war. That was one of the few wars that actually happened on our ground. I would definitely suggest it for its anti-war message."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"the book is very good i have read it the book is bast on htecivle war of 1864 the regrmet is 304 (...)"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Stephen Crane wrote The Red Badge of Courage. It is a novel about the Civil War. In this story, a young boy named Henry Fleming enrolls in the Union Army. This book has interesting qualities throughout the story. With this in mind, let's journey back in time to the Civil War. One of the interesting qualities found in this novel is the excitement that occurs throughout the story. During this time, Henry Fleming's army is involved in many battles. What makes these events exciting is the way Henry and the other soldiers view the battles. When the author creates this point of view, the book becomes very interesting. Another quality that makes this novel interesting is the tremendous details contained in the book. An example of these details is the description of Henry Felming's tent. The author describes that he has piled up cracker boxes to serve as furniture in his small and cramped tent. The author also describes how the fireplace has been built with clay and sticks. The author also describes the way that the land is formed when the army is marching into the next battle. Another interesting quality that this novel has is the imagery that is used to describe the sounds of guns firing during the battles. The author states that the bullet shell was &quot;screaming like a storm banshee as it went over the huddled heads of the soldiers.&quot; With this imagery, the reader can understand the way that the soldiers feel in the moment of battle. These interesting qualities make this book a great story. One of the discouraging qualities was the sadness throughout the story. An example of this sadness was the death of Henry's best friend, Jim. Jim was a funny man who could always make even the most black-hearted sea pirate crack a smile. It is also difficult to understand the grammar of the soldiers when they are speaking to each other. It is hard to understand because of the slang terms, and chopped up words that the soldiers speak such as, &quot;They all seem t'think we've got em jest where we want 'em.&quot; Also, the vocabulary would be hard to understand if the reader is a young person. Some of the words were brand new to me, and I had to look them up in the dictionary to understand their meaning. Overall, I would recommend reading this novel to experience the Civil War and the conflict of that time."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book is first of all a book of historical value.

Of course it doesn't help that people are &quot;forced&quot; to read anything in school. It's better to discover a great novel like this on your own."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When Henry Fleming arrives at the battlegrounds for war as a young Union soldier, little does he know the true battle which awaits him. Despite the obvious physical obstacles he knows and fears he will encounter, he can hardly suspect that he will be the center of a transformation from an innocent young boy into a courageous man. In Stephen Crane's novel, The Red Badge of Courage, the protagonist, Henry Fleming experiences an extraordinary flow of emotions, and these prepare him for the biggest and most important battle he will ever encounter. Crane uses a range of emotions from fear to cowardice, a realization of the reason for war, and finally an internal battle between false heroism and true bravery. The story centers around the experiences of Henry, the people he meets, and the choices he makes. Ultimately, these choices will affect him in ways that will change him forever. This plot, along with Crane's remarkable and amazing descriptions of Henry's visions of war makes this an interesting read for anyone, because it portrays a true positive attitude; and it will teach the reader a lesson he or she will never forget."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Yes, another work by Stephen Crane. We have been required to read both Maggie, a girl of the steets and The Red Badge of Courage for our 11th grade english class. Although these works offer interesting views on crane's naturalistic views of life, they are not enjoyable or exciting. This isn't saying that they are bad books, but they don't seem very interseting to an 11th grader who just want's to get a degree in computer programming. I'm not going to attack the book, because i'm assuming it just wasn't my kind of literature. I did find the book interesting, but when we were required to write a several page essay on how Henry &quot;became a man&quot; I was instantly turned off and was struggling to just understand the how to put the book's psychology in an essay. I know that some people read for enjoyment, but if you aren't out of college STICK WITH MICHAEL CRICHTON oh, and that's assuming that you have the time. This story was quite tedious and frustrating.

I DO NOT reccomend this book to anyone that does not like poetic books or does not want to have to pay a great deal atttention to a book in order to understand it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book chronicles in slow motion the metamorphosis of a naive farmboy, Henry Fleming, as he comes of age during the Civil War. Proclaimed an &quot;American masterpiece of fear, courage, conflict and death&quot;, this poingant tale of brutal initiation into military chaos makes a difficult read, despite its apparent brevity. I suspect that few high school students will appreciate or savor Crane's pre-20th century style; I must admit that it left me wallowing in the dust and mud of quasi boredom. The limited dialogue and long monologues are spelled in dialect and slang, which slows down the pace as we try to decipher the actual words and accents intended.Thoughtful readers will recognize that this book is really a Psychological novel, which just happens to be set within the bloody frame of our most shameful war. There is much military action (skirmishes rather than all-out battles) packed between the covers, but Crane focuses on the mental struggle and emotional turmoil of his protagonist--casually identified as &quot;the youth.&quot; He is so insignificant in the grand military scheme, that he does not even earn a name from the narrator. Indeed we only learn his name in conversation, for the author is hoards specific details. The barely-named secondary characters are identified by their attributes: the loud man, the tall man, the sarcastic soldier, the tattered soldier, etc. Perhaps a name makes us care more about their fate than mere impersonal adjectives...Crane seems as indifferent to their destiny as Nature appears during the smoky scenes of guns and gore.In Henry's defense I must point out that at no time does he consciously plan to desert; nor does he deliberately abaondon his comrades. No one ever accuses him of the foulest military crime (Desertion), yet he is tormented that he almost ran away after the first skirmish. Circumstances separate him from his regiment, but he does not undertake any despicable action and he returns voluntarily. Reduced to mere animal survival instincts, he is too terrified and confused to plan any definite stragegy. Later he strives to keep his initial panic hidden from his regiment; he hugs his shameful secret to his breast like a second rifle. Will Henry ever find justification for his first reaction of horror to the insensate terrors of war? Will he be vindicated and gradually forgive himself-- especially for his fake &quot;wound&quot; which he wore as an undeserved badge? Will this youth ultimately accept the accolade as a &quot;wildcat&quot; on the battlefield and behave as a true war hero? If he survives the physical ordeal, can he endure his own personal scrutiny into his fragile, refined psyche? An introspective read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The writer was heavy and the plot seemed unbelievably boring but I appreciate the work much more now after discussing it with my teacher and classmates. I now know that Crane was actually being very subversive. Because of the irony in RBOC, Crane can be interpreted as being anti-war. It also is an ironic comment about late 19th century boys' bookss and the fear that American men were becoming too effete because of over-civilization. The idea was that men needed to have visceral, barbarous experiences so American men could regain their masculinity and form a national identity as citizens of both moral and physical health (hence the concurrent development of PE and the professionalization of sports). Finally, Crane's analysis about the meaning of manhood is interesting: A boy is a man once he has been perceived as a man by other men (eg when Henry is seen fighting like an animal). I appreciate RBOC much more now that I understand it better."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I did not like the book Red Badge of Courage. There are many reasons why I did not like this book, including lack of plot, confusing, \`jumped' around too much, and others. The Red Badge of Courage had some good parts, but the bad parts clearly out-weighed the good ones. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I have regrets for reading this book. I found this book very confusing, because it used weird words and the dialogue had an unusual dialect to it. Almost the entire book had strange vocabulary that sometimes didn't make sense. Using metaphors usually gives the reader a better picture of the story, but in the Red Badge of Courage metaphors were overused which made the story difficult to follow. In parts of the story you couldn't tell real life from the metaphors and it would get you very confused. In the dialogue of the story the characters had an unusual dialect that gave you a better picture of the character, but it also made it very hard to understand what the character was and wasn't saying. I also did not like this book because it did not have a plot. The whole story was a list of events in chronological order. The book told no reason for all the events. It only told what happened and how. The book also \`jumped' around a bit. An event would happen and then all of a sudden it would jump to another event without a good transition between them, so sometimes you would get lost and it would take you awhile to finally understand what just happened. When the book was talking about the main character, Henry Fleming, it was sometimes unclear what he was really thinking. It would say he was happy and sad in the same sentence and you wouldn't know how he was feeling. In some parts, where there were intense moments, the book didn't tell if he was scared or what, so you couldn't get a good feel about how the main character felt about a lot of the events. Overall I found The Red Badge of Courage a disappointment and a waste of time. When I picked out the book I thought it was going to be an intense story about a man who was in the Civil War and his thoughts and feelings about what was going on, but instead it just told a confusing list of events.

This book is &quot;confusing&quot; because war is complex and both horrible and attractive to the main character, and I suppose it is &quot;boring&quot; because it does not give the pat answers to the problems of war that it raises, but rather requires thoughtful and patient reading. This is not to blame our schoolchildren--it is only to register for them that the fact that something is not immediately consumable by their infantile appetites does not entitle them to comment upon the worth of something that is valued in the world. In other word, be patient when those who are good and more experienced than you recommend something not immediately palatable--you may learn something."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"In contrast to other novels of that era that showed an idealistic, and romantic war, \\"Red Badge of Courage\\" is one of the first realistic war novels of the common soldier. There are no grandiose ideas, no displays of gallantry, and no romantic adventures. This is a war novel but neither side is represented with moral superiority. Indeed, the world that is presented is one which does not care about human life, courage, or bravery.The novel relates the inner struggles of one soldier, Henry, and his fears and doubts as he is about to enter battle for the first time. Throughout the novel, the ideas of courage and manhood conflict with the ideas of self-preservation and survival. He battles with his fears as they play about in his mind, until the first battle commences.Ironically, Henry's ideas of bravery are wrapped in selfish motives, as he wants to be admired and idolized in his hometown as a war hero. After he flees cowardly from the front line, he is condescending toward his fellow soldiers who stood ground and considers them idiots for not fleeing the impending slaughter. However, Henry's inner demons are soon exorcised, as he evolves into one of the bravest members of his regiment. But even his newly found battlefield bravery and heroics are attributed to the desire to prove wrong a general who referred to his regiment as \\"mule drivers.\\"The character development of both Henry and Wilson is complex. Henry transforms from a cowardly, insecure soldier to a brave, battle-hardened veteran. Wilson, who is at first an arrogant, braggadocios soldier, transforms into a caring, benevolent friend of Henry's. Crane makes this subtle point, as Wilson is first referred to as a \\"loud soldier,\\" and subsequently as a \\"friend\\".Crane's novel has scored a trifecta: complex character development, compelling battlefield action, and vivid scenery that relates the overall atmosphere. Although the dialogue of the soldiers can be a bit hard to understand (Crane wanted to make it as realistic as possible), it is an easy read overall. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Stephen Crane never actually fought in battle in the civil war (I don't think he even visited a battlefield), and this novel reflects his personal inexperience. The book lacks comprehensive descriptions and relies too much on personificatin and ambiguity. The prose itself is mediocre and only detracts from the novel's themes.Personally, I wouldn't suggest reading this book unless it is a class requirement. The novel's few moments of excitment are not displayed well at all. It is disappointing to say that the &quot;Wishbone&quot; version of The Red Badge of Courage was more interesting than the actual book. Truthfully, the only reason why I think that the novel is critically acclaimed is because there was a lack of literature focused on the civil war written during the time period."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I found the slang speech of the characters to get annoying after a while and I found the author's narration to be dull, dry, and passive. The writing wasn't particularly good and neither was the plot. At first I thought the whole plot was pretty pointless, but that is partly the point of this book: to show the meaningless, as well as cruel nature of war.Henry initially enlists with the Union Army in the War Between the States with high hopes of glory only to find the life of a soldier boring and unrewarding. Neither Henry nor the other soldiers talk about why they want their side to win the war. Many of the soldiers in the War Between the States were comparatively ignorant of the politics and issues behind the war. When the Union soldiers encounter the Confederate soldiers, they find that the enemy has a lot in common with them- they are just ordinary men with a job to do. The soldiers in this book have a very limited scope of the battle as it is happening; they can only see how their own regiment is doing. Soldiers are given and follow orders, the reasons for which they don't understand. This book accurately and realistically portrays war. Henry realizes that &quot;Nobody seems to know where we go or why we go.&quot; Another soldier stated, &quot;There was shootin' here an' shootin' there an' hollerin' here an' hollerin' there in the damn darkness, until I couldn't tell t' save m' soul which side I was on.&quot; At the end of the novel, after two days of marching and bloodshed, Henry's regiment is ordered back to where it started, which conveys that all the previous struggles and deaths were for nothing. Specifically, this book makes a definite statement that war is pointless and chaotic.More generally, you could put an existential interpretation on it, extending the story to life, not just war. While part of a meaningless and cruel war that he doesn't understand, Henry manages to find his own meaning in it, from within himself. At the closing of the novel, Henry doesn't know whether the army has won the battle or if the battle is even over but he has been courageous and that's the best he can do. During grim battle, Henry is amazed to see a &quot;blue pure sky and the sun gleaming on the trees and fields.&quot; This shows that the universe does not care about the desperation of the world. Henry is a small man trapped in a large army, which is in a even larger world. There's not much Henry can do, but he does what he can. That's his personal victory in the end- he copes as good as he can in a big, inhospitable world.Another theme is individualism -vs- conformity to the group. Crane has depersonalized the army and stressed that it is one coherent group, not a bunch of individuals. In the army, Henry and the other soldiers have been &quot;welded into a common personality...dominated by a single desire.&quot; One effect of focus on the group is that the individual shrinks in importance. In joining the army, Henry became a small &quot;part of a vast blue demonstration.&quot; Some critics have said the book promotes conformity to the group because Henry matures only when he does not run from battle and stays to fight with and for the army. But in being loyal to the group, Henry envies Jim, who because of his courage and loyalty dies in agony. In wanting to be in good standing in the army, Henry actually wants a wound, which he equates with courage. Being loyal to the army could get Henry killed at any time. The irony is that while Henry emerges from the story a victor, that battle (Chancellorsville) historically ended in a major defeat for the Union. There's definitely the issue of individualism versus conformity in this book, but I think it conveys the message that a certain degree of conformity is necessary in our society, but that it is detrimental to the individual."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"You may think that a red badge of courage is some high medal of honor for a great accomplishment or deed, but it isn't. It is an injury or wound. Sure some people wanted to have a red badge because they where honored to die for their country, but not all people wanted one. The Red Badge of Courage is a book about a young man named Henry in the Civil War. When he was a child he dreamed of battle and fighting, but when the first real battle came he wasn't so sure he liked it anymore. He saw his friend die. He saw many people die. Then he got his own red badge. He was hit on the side of his head with a strong blow from a fellow member's musket of his own regiment when he was retreating from battle. He wanders into the woods lost and confused. Can Henry prove himself during the war? Can he find his way back to his regiment? Can he stay alive? To find out you'll have to read it yourself! I liked this book because it was a story of great courage and bravery. Henry was around the age I am, and I could relate to how he was feeling very easily. I enjoy books about history and wars and this was an excellent example of one. I think others will like this book because they too can probably relate to how Henry is feeling in the book. This is an exciting book that I think will please all types of book lovers. It has action, suspense, danger, and adventure. I hope others will read this book because I don't know how they could miss it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage Excellent book!The Red badge of Courage by Stephen Crane, is an excellent book to read and experience. The book deals with the fears, sorrows, the cowardice and courage of the soldiers as they fought one of the bloodiest wars-Chancellorsville. Although the author has not lived during the war, his writing portrays how the soldier felt in incredible accuracy. His book is written in great detail and lets the reader know how the soldiers felt. His book is also very emotional and exciting during the mourning and the fighting scenes of the story. Of course his book isn&iexcl;t perfect, however this book is really close to being a perfect book. Stephen Crane has very few weak points in his writing. In his book, the quotes of the soldiers were kind of hard to understand because of the heavy slang that they all use when they have a conversation. Such as &iexcl;We&iexcl;ve on&iexcl;y got t&iexcl; git across that lot!&iexcl;. The reader needs to know a little about the southeastern slang before he or she reads it. Therefore, the conversation that the soldiers had often during the book tends to be very confusing and quite boring to the reader. This book is a great book to read because of the variety of schemes the book is written in such as violence, emotional, and exciting. I would recommend this book to any boys or girls older than 13 because of the violence and slang that he uses in the book. It is a great book for anyone that likes history with a little violence put into it. I would also recommend this book to anyone that is interested of war or anyone that wants to read a good fictional book based on the battle of Chancellorsville."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"From what I understand, Civil War reenactments are hugely popular, especially at war sites throughout the South. Participants even go so far as to buy the exact rations (I heard the biscuits are like bricks!), wear authentic uniforms, etc. What a trip! For such people, I highly recommend Courage. It deals with the fear felt by a soldier in a war he did not fully understand. (Who did?) Nation vs. Nation, Brother vs. Brother. God forbid that we would ever again disagree with each other in such magnitude! There are a lot of things I think I would have missed had I not followed along in the Cliffs Notes. It kept me informed as to some deeper meanings. The book is certainly not long, but for me it bogged down in several places. However, I'm glad that I had a chance to experience war through someone else's eyes rather than have to face such a situation in my own life. And to imagine that Crane wrote this book based only on interviews he had with Civil War vets! To me, this is an amazing fact."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Whats wrong with all of you?

Then, it seemed to plumb the depths of a youthful soul confronting his own fears, probing his insecurities, and testing his courage. Now it seems like an over-written book from the pen of someone who wasn't in a war.The three days of the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville is the unnamed backdrop to the story. Crane wrote it when he himself was only 22 years old, but that was thirty years after the battle. His prose is the complicated verbosity of a young man with more vocabulary than ideas to fill it. He goes on and on about things he knows nothing about and misses what he should have seen. Had Crane been in combat, he would have found a way to articulate the inchoate images, disconnected flashes, the panicked silences shot through with deafening thunders. He also would have captured the heart-pounding immediacy of chaos. Instead, Henry Fleming thinks through his choices and then thinks them through again. He rationalizes his cowardice in long complicated self-examinations. Crane's battles are coherent things, described in orderly detail by one who has read of them and imagined them, but not experienced them. The battle is marginal to Fleming's passage.Had Crane been in battle he would have recognized that courage often has less to do with self-examination or a sudden passage to manhood than it does with camaraderie. It is often a simple disinclination to let one's friends down. In the story, Fleming only makes the acquaintance of two or three other soldiers, none by name. His passage to courage is entirely anomic, individual, and alienated from the rest of his unit. The traditional interpretation of these characters as \`any men' populating the universe of Fleming's \`any youth' is disingenuous. Youths have friends, soldiers have comrades. These define the subject as surely as his own introspection, and they do so in individualized detail.Fleming's understandable fear in his first battle is somehow belittled by the extravagant cowardice of his wordy explanations. He is a selfish whiner who, at one point, hopes the battle will be lost and justify his cowardice. Crane no doubt chose to portray Fleming's boyish fear in stark and easy labels, so that his later passage to courage would be the more striking. But rather than a dramatic effect, the story is merely simplistic. The conclusion is fable-like, not credible, and therefore not of great interest to adults. Combat fear doesn't fade in three days, it goes on forever. This isn't a bad book, just a simple one. It is the story of a boy who learns to be brave. Perhaps it's not nearly as interesting to an adult as to a teenager grappling with the same issues, but as a nineteenth century fairy tale, it may be instructive to youths."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I found this book about the civil war and easy to read because it was very interesting. The book was based a drummer named Henry Flemming, a young man who at the beginning is scared for his life, finds himself commanding a division of infantry with new friend Wilson. The tite Red Badge of Courage comes from a badge symbolizing bravery and courage. When Henrys best friend Jim Conklin dies, the war represents the enviroment is still moving even though he has died. After his death, Henry is confused and angry at his recent choices of running from the battlefront. He strived to be a hero, and thats what he did. This book's moral to me is to always keep your head up and do your best at everything you do. Some of the things that I didn't enjoy very much were that it didn't really tell the awful details of war, if the author is going to release a book out about war, it usually should tell people that war is not a good thing and teach people it is not something to wish for.

Stephen Crane uses many metaphors in The Red Badge of Courage. It is a very difficult book until you get to the middle of the book because in the first half Crane throws you into a world of fear, cowardice, panic and confusion. It catches the reader's attention by presenting the Civil War in such great detail that the reader cannot help but picture scenes in their own mind.The tale of Red Badge of Courage is about a youthful boy named Henry Fleming who goes to war. He thinks about many things when his regiment is moving around. One thing is if he is going to run once they get into battle. When Henry finally goes to war he doesn't run away which boosts his confidence. However in the second battle what he sees causes him to run.Henry goes back to his regiment and in the third battle steps up and fights well. He fights almost the best out of his whole regiment. Since Henry fought so good in the third battle he got to be the flag barrier in the fourth and final battle. The book continues telling us that Henry captures the opposite teams flag.The one and only complaint I have about this book is there is too much detail. There is so much detail sometimes I would lose track of the plot. However, the great detail is the reason the book is so good.

I found it as a very interesting short novel. It was quite different from the long novels that i am used to reading. As many novels use many pages to convey its story and meaning, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; was able to do just that in such a small amount of space. The characters and dialogue were well thought out and vivid, creating an atmosphere in which you felt you were part of. The book conveyed the feeling of war and battle in a fashion i found very effective, as war is one of the things i am most interested in. The feeling of intense battle and warfare, with the bullets piercing the flesh of the soldiers whom destinies were carved by the guns of the enemies, was quite overwhelming at times, but created a brilliant atmosphere.

A mind twister and masterpiece of it's time, I believe it to be one of the most real accounts of Civil War that I have read. And I find that many people overlook it. Though Crane wrote it before he had even seen war, he took what he knew (from Matthew Brady's photographs, and real accounts he had heard from old soldiers) he was able to produce one of the best mind war novels in American Literature."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"A classic which I first read in the early 'forties and just re-read, this is the tale of a youth who joined the Army to fight on the Union side in the Civil War, or as some call it the War of the Rebellion, since no wars are really &quot;civil.&quot;Henry Fleming was a farm youth in New York when, with images of future acts of heroism in his mind, he joined the Army and went off to war with memories of his mother's prayerful tears in his mind. While encamped on a river within sight and sound of enemy pickets and listening to the stories of his peers, he begins to doubt his courage.The story is filled with images of the horror and carnage of war, although written lyrically and sensitively. If there is a lesson, besides the dreadfulness of large numbers of men trying desperately to kill each other, it is that one and the same man can experience depths of cowardice and pinnacles of courage and brave acts, depending upon his surroundings and how they affect him.I loved the story in my 'teens, and I am still greatly impressed by it in my seventies--and I have seen the elephant!Joseph H.

Instead, it is an account of a youth whose battlefield is his mind. The approach which Stephen Crane, the author, took surprised me, because I had expected a story in which the main conflict was that the characters fought their physical enemy. Although the book was quite short, the content of the novel is breath-taking. The manner the author uses to describe settings, thoughts of fears going on inside of the youth's head, and battle scenes is fascinating. The story takes place during the Civil War, and Crane gives an excellent view of what soldiers might have been thinking while fighting, awaiting the day when the torture of war would end.

I have heard how wonderful it is and the dramatic scenes it holds. When I read the book, honestly, I was disappointed. I didn't understand most of it; it was confusing. I wasn't the only one who thought so, most of my peers did not understand it either. In some parts, it just went on, and on, and on, and on; there were parts when it got really boring. The part I did understand was okay.Mainly, the story is about a young soldier named Henry Fleming, the youth. He enlists into the army of the North side during the Civil War. He is glad to join, but then, he begins to doubt himself and he is afraid he will run instead of fighting in battle. Indeed, he runs away, but then discovers that he is a coward. Henry has a second chance to prove his bravery, in which he succeeds.If you understand the main point of the story, and you understand the symbolism such as the squirrel, and Jim Conklin dying, then it become pretty good. But if you read it and not pay attention to every single thing it describes, it gets boring. That was my problem, I wasn't paying attention to EVERY little thing that happened.

Ever. And I like classic books. I've read War and Peace and David Copperfield and Middlemarch and Tess of the D'Urbervilles and loved them, but this book I could barely get through, for the following reasons.1.) Crane feels the need to write all the dialogue in some kind of awful backwoods slang.Ex: \\"Mebbe, it wa'n't all his fault--not all together. He did th' best he knowed. It's our luck t' git licked often.\\"Apparently during the civil war era, no one could speak in full sentences, or even full words.2.) The description is absolutely ridiculous. It's overdone and insane, and Crane apparently found some kind of cruel joy in making up ridiculous metaphors. Ex:\\"Each distant thicket seemed a strange porcupine with quills of flame.\\"\\"The colonel, perchance to relieve his feelings, began to scold like a wet parrot.\\"\\"The hush was solemn and churchlike, save for a distant battery that, evidently unable to remain quiet, sent a faint rolling thunder over the ground. It irritated, like the noises of unimpressed boys.\\"\\"The white-topped wagons strained and stumbled in their exertions like fat sheep.\\"\\"He often tried to dismiss the question, but his body persisted in rebellion and his senses nagged at him like pampered babies.\\"\\"This noise, following like the yelpings of eager, metallic hounds, increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings.\\"Truly awful. Do you think maybe Crane was just messing with people? It's hard to believe that someone smart enough to read and write would actually use metaphors like these on purpose.3.) The characters are one dimensional and you never get to know them,4.) The plot is nonexistent.5.) The youth\\" doesn't die.

I just read Red Badge of Courage by Stephan Crane and I thought it was ok. The book took place during the Civil War and about a young solider, named Henry. Henry made excuses everytime he ran away or lie about something. In this book, I enjoyed the part where the loud solider, Wilson, changed his personality because the war had changed him and he is like a motherly figure now. If I could change anything in this story, it would be Henry because he questions his own character. I do not recommend this book for any girl. If you like a classic Civil War book, I think is a story for you."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"CritiqueI have decided to design my critique on the basis of Stephen Crane and the book itself. I have to declare that I was extremely angry at all the people who have acclaimed this book to be one of the best references to the atmosphere of the Civil War. First, I would like to state that when a book is exclaimed at describing the atmosphere of an event such as the Civil War it should describe it from all angularities. Not once did the book mention any noted person who partook action in the civil war. People such as Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. Lee have not been mentioned at all. I can personally describe to you, many problems that the Union army had in its management but Mr. Crane just inhibits the scenario by fabricating some of his characters to mock the lieutenants and generals in charge of a certain regiment or brigade. Another key implement in educing the atmosphere of the Civil War in a novel, would be to interact common day people into the book. People don't realize that the United States Civil War devastated the lives of the normal people more than any military man. There was only one scene in which there was interaction in the book on that basis. That was the scene consisting of Henry Fleming's departure from his mother. Lastly, on the atmospheric scenario, I cannot see how one can write a book on the Civil War without bringing out its essential clause onto the surface. Absolutely nothing was discussed regarding slavery. The very element which stifled the talks and brought forth the Civil War was slavery. I don't see how any author could avert this scenario from the overall picture of the book. I understand that his intent was not to dramatize slavery but there should have been some sort of external link connecting it in some way with the plot. I would also like to claim that Stephen Crane does an extremely poor job in linking his parameters within the plot. In the beginning of the story he describes how the youth is nervous about retreating from the battleground and how is philosophically thinking up of ways to describe his point. Though I personally believe that this is a lame counter plan for such mentality I will grant him the premise. What is pathetic is that he never again mentions how Henry overcame this great fear that he had. He shows that he runs away, watches his friend die, and recuperates with the army. Nevertheless, he never mentions how this dread of retreating was overcome. Another parameter within the plot which is left unmentioned is the transformation that occurs in Wilson. Crane established in the beginning of the story that Wilson had a very arrogant and protruding personality. He also hinted in the 3rd chapter about how he might be vulnerable to minute cases of defamation, but there is no analysis given in the entire book which might show one the transformation that Wilson had from being a conceited and supercilious person to becoming a kind and loving one. My third critique on the book is that it is just too boring. The context of the book is described in such asinine manners that it makes me feel a very unimaginative person-who had an 800 on the verbal section of the SAT - wrote the book. After the first half of the book was finished, Crane just basically repeated the scenes with different words. They fight, win or lose, sleep, wake up, and fight again. It seemed to me that I was reading a newspaper written in the 1850's. You might also notice this in my summary. I pondered for hours thinking on how I could make the second half of the book sound interesting but I think that I have not fully been successful in doing so. My last and most important critique on the book is that it should have been written in first person. Most of the people that I have protruded upon claim that the perspective one chooses to write a story from doesn't affect the story in any way but I think that it heavily does. In a book like this it is very important that one implicates the first person perspective and not the third person because I believe that the essential goal of the author is to show the mental disintegrations that the war caused amongst people. I am not claiming that physical details in a war story are unimportant. Rather, I am stating that in a book mental aspects have to be given a higher statute. Physical details can be accumulated through any newspaper or news magazine while mental aspects can usually not. There is no way the same impact can be drawn when you are describing the mentality of a person as a third person bystander. It does not provide the reader with the same type of personal mental connection with a character. I personally think that third person perspective should only be used when there is more than one definite main character. In conclusion I would like to state that although the intent of the Stephen Crane was positive and well thought of, he failed in influencing any type unique claim which supports the intent. I know that most people would personally disagree with me because I have just seemingly slandered one of the renown classics in the literature world but the information above does reflect my personal overview. If Stephen Crane was alive today I would advise him to read Uncle Tom's Cabin and take notes."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane shows the inner struggle of a young soldier as he encounters many obstacles throughout the Civil War. Henry had a burning desire for most of his life to be a brilliant war hero. When the army was searching for young men to enlist, Henry thought that this was his once in a lifetime opportunity, so he enlisted. A couple days later Henry was sent to army camp where he soon learned that war was not as glamorous as he had imagined it to be. Instead, Henry discovers that death and destruction are the real components of war. Along with the real battle, Henry has an inner battle which in the beginning of the book his fear was defeating his confidence. But slowly through the events of the war his confidence begins to overcome his fear. This book is for readers who like an exciting, fast-pace book. Stephen Crane does an excellent job of describing the Battle of Chancellorsville through imagery diction, similes and metaphors. Crane writes about the war as if he were actually a soldier participating in the Civil War. Using his realistic writing technique Crane takes his readers on journey on which they experience everything from being ambushed to defeating the enemy."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a novel with very little closure. The story leaves the reader wondering what the signifance of the story is to any other character besides Henry Flemming. It starts off with a young man who seeks more in life, and therefore decides the enlist in the army. He is warned not to be a hero by his mother before he leaves, yet ironically, he leaves the war a hero within his regiment. Henry Flemming, often referred to as the &quot;youth,&quot; balances his life through te progression of the story. He commits some very unethical and possibly sinful acts in the beginning, but his actions by the end of the sotry overlap his sins, creating a balanced life. Henry did a very good job in the war, according to his regiment and the authorities. He does such a great job because, not only does he feel bad for what he had done in the beginning of the war, but also he begins to have this hatred for the enemy. This hatred leads him to be a great fighter and also to being considered highly of by higher ranked officers of the Union. This story decribes a man's change from immaturity and youthfulness, into the world of manhood and maturity. Overall, The Red Badge of Courage would not be something that should be read more than once. It was good reading, yet it did not seem to give the reader as much closure as other novels give."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"For those of you youngens who can not handle the true essince of a book I suggest you read something else.

After reading The Red Badge of Courage I got a better understanding of what it might have been like for the soldiers.

Several soldiers of the 304th Maine, including Pvt. Henry Fleming, are discussing the plausibility of a newly discovered rumor. Henry takes the news of the upcoming battle apprehensively, as a result of dwelling on the subject of his own courage, and if he has the will to put his life at stake during battle. He knows that he will never truly know until the first bullets come, and fears that he may not be satisfied with his instincts.After a long march, the orders for the soldiers are to prepare for a fight. After a seemingly endless reprieve, musket fire as well as cannon fire begins, and Henry's first battle has begun. Many of his fellow soldiers desert, but Henry fights against his instincts and stays with those of strong spirit. Then, another attack comes, and Henry cannot control his actions, leaving his regiment behind in panic.By now he has wandered off into the woods. After finally finding his regiment, he is then taken care of as wounded, because of his accidental head clashing while running through a skirmish. Instead of being a humiliated coward, Henry is given the respect of a courageous soldier.After awakening the next morning, his regiment is marched to a new position to relieve a unit that has already been fighting. Not long after, the sound of muskets is heard again, and another battle begins.A charge then begins, and they find themselves in the midst of smoke and bullets. Suddenly, the color sergeant who is carrying the unit's flag, is put in the sight of a Confederate rifle, and is killed. Fleming quickly jumps to the sergeant's side, and grabs the flag from his hands. Henry is now at the head of the charge, gallantly waving the torn flag through rising smoke and passing bullets, proving his courage not only to himself, but also all of the 304th Maine.I came to the final conclusion that this book should be read solely because of its historical value. Just as a story, I believe that it lacks great excitement and any interesting dialogue. For the most part, the style of writing is noticeably dull. I do find it intriguing that some of the writing does seem modern. Over the years, The Red Badge of Courage has become one historical novel that all others are judged by, and therefore should be read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I am currently reading a book called The Red Badge of Courage written by Stephen Crane.

It is an inspirational tale of a boy who takes up where his brother leaves off when he receives the red badge of courage, the precursor of sorts to the purple heart.

His mother stalls him for sometime until he signs up. He joins the 304th New York Regiment. After some disappointment because of no fighting, he is suddenly caught in many battles. He is so frightened that he cannot shoot. Soon after wards he gets used to it as his regiment fights more battles. As it gets deeper into the story, many of Henry's friends are killed in battle. In fact, all of them are dead except for one. During one large battle, Henry's regiment is nearly completely destroyed from a charge at the enemy. The story ends when the rebels are forced to retreat and the Union forces press south.My favorite part of the book is the big battle. Henry's regiment makes a brave stand and drives off the enemy. Then they run a charge against the enemy forces and win another victory. However, many brave soldiers gave up their lives in this battle.This book is rather confusing at first, but if you read on it becomes one very interesting book. It has lots of exciting points in the story. If you like books about war or brave people, I think this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This is one of those books that are on class reading lists and therefore I imagine many avoid it because it sounds like one of those dull \\"important\\" books. However, I think this stands as a true book for our times as well as for the time in which it was written.It does take some slow reading, but it is a short novel and therefore not that much of a labor. There is a stark reality to it and I don't see how anyone can avoid identifying with the young protagonist. This isn't a rah rah book about war. The Civil War is not glamorized neither does the author take sides as to who's right and who's wrong. It is a grim portrait of youth fighting a bitter war and has much to say from that viewpoint.This book is so well known that I don't think a lengthy exposition of the story is necessary. But it is worth reading for all who haven't yet read it. And if you happen to be a student who has this on a reading list, don't be afraid of it. Give it a good serious reading and I believe this will be one you'll long remember."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"In this book The Red Badge of Courage, Henry is a coward but at times is a hero who cant wait to go and fight. First, at times Henry just cant stand himself and he has to go and fight. An example is when one time Henry was waiting in camp and just couldn't wait anymore but he gets sent into battle and he runs away and he still believes he a hero. Secondly, Henry is a brave man who helps any one that is in danger. Henry actually one time when he was getting cover from a log he hears many screams and he jumps out and starts shooting and he saved many men. Third, at the end of the story hennery does one of the most, brave things any one has done on the battlefield. Dangerously Henry drops his gun so he can hold up his flap to show respect and he some how he survives when he ran straight toward the enemy to try to scare them. Forth, at times Henry will sit down and just give up that are why he's also a coward. Like one time Henry was fighting fine then he sees his friend get shot and instead of running and helping him he just runs and hides behind a tree and just sits there until the fight is over. So now you can see why at times Henry can feel exited to go into battle and He'll be a hero, but at other times he'll be and coward and run and hide."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"It's kind of an old-fashioned book; a little confusing and hard to follow.

I just read The Red Badge of Courage and I thought that it was a little boring and confunsing because of the Southern dialogue, and the slow storyline. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a young boy named Henry who desperately wanted to be a heroic soldier. In this book, I enjoyed the part where Henry joined the line of wounded soldiers, and found his friend Jim Conklin because it was good to see them find each other. If I could change anything in this story, it would be the way the dialogue is written, because it was sometimes hard to understand. I do recommend this book even though it was sort of slow.

I found myself lost in most parts of the book. Crane is a very talented writer, he is very descriptive in his works, but I just do not prefer his writing style. If you prefer hemmingway-straight and to the point, you won't enjoy Crane's writing. Stephen Crane spends a lot more slower pace on his point making. Usualy taking a page to explain one thing. Another interested fact that I saw in Crane's writing was that he doesn't name specificly his characters. Instead he will use a characteristic that they will go by through the whole book.

Nevertheless, this book utilizes disorganized, repetitive, and hollow sentences to describe, almost as if Crane were using the intrinsic qualities of the war itself as a crutch.I would only recommend this novel as a quick (couple of hours)route to teach readers to keep an open mind; that antiquated &quot;popular&quot; opinions should not be subscribed to blindly."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"&quot; The red sun, pasted in the sky like a wafer&quot; The Red Badge of Courage continues to generate criticism on what war is all about. The Red Badge of Courage displays a view on what its like to go to war as a young boy. Henry decides to go off to war. Against his own mother's words. Henry thinks he can help with the war and become a hero. Henry gets a reality check as soon as he gets to the army. He is not as tough as he thinks he is. He starts to become very scared and sad. He now fears going into battle instead of wanting to challwenge his fighting skills he thinks he has. When Henry finally goes into battle, he is scared and wishes he never joined the army. He is seeing all his friends around him being killed and blood being shed. Henry becomes furious and scared and does not have a clue as to what's going on. He sees the enemy and all he can do is just fire his gun and run away, and hope everything is OK. After some time Henry starts to realize the meaning of life , and he starts to apperciate things much more. He realizes he can't run from everything. It was his choice to join the army. Henry starts to mature a little bit I think. As the war goes on. He starts to believe in himself and not worry about what others think. I think that this book is a good example of what a young boy acted like during this time period. As I continued to read on and come closer to the end, Things started to come together for Henry, As well as his regiment. Henry was not just some farm boy anymore, He was starting to become a man.

While there are not enough details provided in the book for certain innacuracies to be pointed out one glaring detail was the almost total lack of interaction with civilians in the war. But perhaps some great philosophical point is being raised here? Probably not because the lesson at the end of this book is hardly universal and most people learn it before they leave elementary school.

Was there a plot to this book? It is simple to say that this book is a coming of age story dealing with how war de-humanizes all who join its ranks; but is it really, or is that just what Stephen Crane wants you to believe?There may be a plot buried somewhere beneath the trite battle scenes and bland descriptions of a landscape more enthralling than any of the characters- but the dig to find this missing plot is not worth the wait. Perhaps we should simply view this book at face value; a story with characters who are as thin and shallow as the paper they are printed on.If you're looking for a quick read (125 pages, in my edition, that I knocked off in a night and a half), then this is most certainly the book for you. However, if you're looking for a book that's intriguing and worth you're time, don't bother with this one.

It is a realistic fiction book. This story takes place in the civil war time period. This story is about a farm boy name Henry Fleming, who sets out to join the military for honor and glory. Although he is in the army he is worried that if he was to get in to a battle he might run away. Finally his army regiment is ready to march into battle. They spend many days walking on foot when they reach a battlefield, and start to hear something so they quickly run to secure their position. Then the confederate troops start to attack Henry's regiment. There is no way to escape because he is caught up in all the commotion. So he starts to fire randomly at the enemy line. He blacks out for a second and wakes up and flees away for the battle. He flees to from battle where he passes a bunch of wounded soldiers. He meets a wounded soldier that has been shot twice he speaks to Henry of how proud he was that his regiment didn't flee. Henry thinks of these wounds as \\"red badges of courage\\". the man Henry meets keeps asking Henry where his wounds are but Henry has nothing to say and pays no attention to his questions. Later on Henry and the wounded soldier find another soldier that is badly hurt Henry sees that the soldier is Jim Conklin, a boy for Henrys regiment. Henry later on sees Jim dies from his wounds right before him. Henry and the wounded man are wondering in the woods when the hear the sound of battle in the distance the mans health is getting worse but he still continues to ask Henry about his wounds. Henry can not take his questions any more so he abandons the man to die. Henry continues to walk closer to the battle where he can watch it from a safe distance. He sees his regiment retreating and he tries to stop them and find out what is going on, in all the commotion he gets hit on the head with a rifle and it opens a wound on his head. He is taken back to his camp by his regiment. The next day they go into battle and Henry over comes his fears and fights proudly for his regiment they win the battle and Henry carries the union flag proudly thought the rest of the battles his regiment faces. The resolution is Henry over comes his fear and proudly carries the flag of the union and is named his regiments best fighter.

Crane shows how young boys can look at the soldier from home and see a hero to be imitated. He then puts his main character, a boy, in the center of the war by making him enlist. Crane's description of war is so clear and accurate. First of all, war kills people in groups. War leaves many more soldiers with loses. Loses of limbs, organs, and mental health. Every time I hear a young person in the subway discuss enlisting into the military, I wonder if he has read Red Badge of Courage.\\""},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"As The Red Badge of Courage opens, members of a newly recruited regiment are debating a fresh rumor&lt;they are finally going to move out on the next day and engage the enemy. One young soldier, named Henry Fleming, does not engage in the debate and instead reflects on what will become of him when he get to battle. Will he run or will he stand and fight bravely. He enlisted because he wanted to be a hero, thinking of Greek epics. His own mother, however, was not interested in such ideas, and discouraged him from enlisting. When he finally did, she did not have an impassioned speech for him. She merely says that if he is ever in a situation where he will be killed or do something wrong, he should go with his feelings. With these words, Henry left his home and entered his army duty. He had not seen his foes yet, save a conversation with one across a riverbank late one night. The veterans tell them of gray, mad, rampaging hordes; but he does not trust their tales very much. However, he does not care who he fights, just that he will not run away. He is panicked at the proposition. He talks with other soldiers&lt;the tall one (named Jim Conklin) and the loud one (named Wilson). Both believe in themselves enough to say that they will fight as hard as they can, but neither goes as far to say that they definitely will not run.The regiment does not move out on the rumored day, but soon thereafter. They march through other Union armies, dressed in blue. Their youth shows, as their uniforms still seem so new they gleam. Soon after, though, the tall soldier kicks Henry awake. The regiment is gathered and the men run down wood roads. During this time, Henry's thoughts are mixed and various. He feels that he should have never enlisted and misses his home. The next moment, he feels the overwhelming need to see a battle taking place. After he does so, upon cresting a hill and looking at a skirmish down below, he watches in quiet fascination, but does not desire to participate. Then, after the men march more and he sees his first dead body, he begins to suspect that they are being led to their slaughter, to be sacrificed to a red war god. He wants to tell his mates, but is afraid of their jibes and scoffing in return.Soon, the regiment is facing an actual conflict. Wilson, the loud soldier, is so certain he will die that he gives Henry a packet of letters to send to his family. As they line up to fight, rumors fly again about the state of their army. Smoke and noise from guns rise around them. Bullets and shells whistle towards them. A regiment in front, already engaging the enemy, is beaten and flees the battleground. The youth imagines that they were beaten by a monster. He resolves to get a view of this monster, even if he very well may flee himself. The regiment is soon engaged. They work feverishly, firing and reloading. The smoke chokes them and makes their eyes red. Henry feels full of rage. Men fall occasionally around him. Soon, the enemy retreats. The men relax. Henry feels satisfied that he has overcome the trials of war.Soon, the regiment is facing an actual conflict.

Henry feels satisfied that he has overcome the trials of war.However, the men have not rested for long when the Rebels attack again. They fight fiercely once more. Henry feels different this time. He feels that the monster of war, a red and green dragon, will come through the gray smoke and swallow him. After a few men around him flee, the youth's own fear gets the better of him. He drops his weapon and runs from the battle. As he goes through the forest and past cannons, he is sure that the dragon is pursuing him and that these others fighting against it are fools, going like lemmings to their death. However, as he finally stops by an officer, he finds that his regiment won the battle. He is thunderstruck. He realizes that he has done something very wrong, though he tries to justify it to himself that it was through superior powers of observation. He imagines the insults he will have to bear when returning to camp and attempts to get as far away from them and the monster of war as possible. He walks into a forest. The noises of the conflict gradually become fainter. He feels more at peace, that his actions are more in congress with nature. However, as he goes, he encounters a corpse, with a faded uniform. The glassy-eyed stare grabs him for a moment in fear. Then the youth slowly turns away, creeping from the body; then he turns and runs away as fast as he can.He goes through the forest and into the open. He finds a road and walking upon it a procession of wounded soldiers. They are suffering and moaning as they limp down the road. A tattered soldier, wounded twice, tries to talk to Henry about the battle and where the youth has been shot. These questions bring his embarrassment and guilt out. He tries to run away in the crowd. He eventually runs into Jim Conklin, the tall soldier, wounded and near death. Henry tries to help him, but his friend is too close to death. The tattered man comes up to assist as well, but Jim runs off into the fields, where he staggers and falls over dead. The tattered man tries to talk more with Henry, telling him stories of men he knows in the army and how he became wounded. Again, the man asks Henry where his wounds are located. The youth tells him to not bother him, and slips away from the man, leaving him blubbering and wondering about in the field.As he continues on, Henry eventually encounters a retreating band of carts and horses. This makes him feel temporarily good; if the whole army is retreating, his flight will not be so suspicious. However, soon a column of troops comes up the road. Henry looks at these men as brave, and he soon gets the will to fight. However, more thoughts come into his head. He considers that he is low and guilty. His comrades will see him as a worm. These thoughts make him thirst and ache. He tries to justify his flight in his head, but his emotions betray him. He wishes he were dead.Soon, the column comes running out of the grove into which they marched. All is chaos and pandemonium. Henry is shocked to see that these heroic figures have been so quickly turned into scampering animals. He tries to stop one to ask him what happened, but only blubbers his words. The man hits him on the head with his rifle. Henry is dazed and injured. He wonders in the dark until a kind man helps him find his regiment.There, no harsh words await him. Wilson and another soldier bandage his wound, which Henry claims is from a bullet. The others do not seem to care that much, just that he gets attention and rest, which he does. When he awakes, he finds that his friend, Wilson, is not so much the loud soldier he once was. He takes special care of Henry, is reflective, and breaks up fights around him. The youth notices this change from irritation to tranquility. However, he feels that he has a weapon against his friend&lt;the packet of letters he gave in haste at the beginning of the battle the day before. Fearful of being discovered as a coward, he imagines that with this packet he can ward off any shame that questioning from Wilson would give him. However, Wilson sheepishly asks for the packet before Henry can do anything. While he maintains a haughty air, the youth can say no barbs against his friend as he hands the envelope back to him.The regiment today moves from one embankment to another, always taking cover and seeing some of battle, but not actually participating in it. The youth is now talkative, perhaps overly so. He tries to show his pride, and is silenced for it; for he knows that he in fact fled battle yesterday and was not shot. A sarcastic soldier cuts him down and later his lieutenant tells him to stop talking and start fighting. The regiment does this soon enough. They are attacked by the Rebels and repel them. This battle, Henry fights as if he were crazed, shooting at them long after the battle is finished. This makes some of the men look at him with curiosity. Henry regards himself as a barbarian.Soon, Wilson and Henry take an opportunity to get water for the regiment. After they search for a stream unsuccessfully, they encounter a general and his staff in a road. In the midst of the conversation, they hear that their regiment of \\"mule drivers\\" is going to charge the enemy, with perhaps many casualties. They return to their fellow soldiers with this news, but do not tell them that the general doubted that they will survive.The charge begins soon. It takes the regiment a minute, but they are soon running with haste at the enemy. Many are shot in the process. Henry now feels that he sees things clearly. He and the other men go into a frenzy. But eventually, they stop. The lieutenant yells, screams, and curses at them to continue. Wilson breaks the spell by firing his rifle. Others soon follow his lead. Soon, Henry sees the flag of his army, which revives him. As his color sergeant is soon shot, he leaps for the flag, along with Wilson, to hold it for himself. The battle rages on, with Henry holding the flag aloft. The men dig in slightly, as their numbers diminish. Henry is full of rage. He is thinking little, only feeling his anger. The lieutenant and Henry are both trying to get the men to continue. Soon, the officer sees that the men in gray are trying to advance onto their position. Automatically, the regiment fires into them, causing the enemy to retreat. Satisfied, they go back to their lines.When they return, they are greeted with jeers from the veterans and reprimands from the higher officers. They stopped short of an impressive charge, they learn. The men, who had been so proud of themselves, find that their efforts are not seen as sufficient, let alone brave. Soon, though, Wilson and Henry here a story through one of their fellow soldiers that a colonel and lieutenant were discussing their particular prowess in battle. This fills their hearts with pride.Soon, the battle is on again. The men in blue charge the men in gray once more. Again, the regiment finds itself in open territory, peppered by bullets. Henry is intent on standing upright, keeping the flag strong, though the men around him are still falling. Then the order comes to charge. The men to not shirk; they fix bayonets and wildly charge toward the gray smoke of the enemy's guns. On the other side, the youth knows, are the men who made this. He must see them. As they approach the enemy lines, the opposing flag comes into view. Wilson leaps at it and grabs it from the hands of the just-shot color sergeant. There are four prisoners of war, all looking very young and very human in their own faces. The men in blue are victorious.Henry, upon walking away with the regiment, first feels pride in his accomplishments of battle. Then he remembers his flight and his treatment of the tattered man, and guilt riles up in him again. He is concerned his mate will see it. However, he eventually lets this go. He now sees his previous thoughts on war and battle as silly and is happy to find himself doing so. He has made it through the trials of battle, from the red and the black, and is changed into a man.

A young man, Henry Flemming moves from his mother's farm to enlist in the Union Army. Once enlisted, while a sitting at a Union campsite, another soldier, Jim Conklin, tells the platoon that he received word of a march to a battle ground. Flemming starts to question his bravery after hearing the news of a battle soon to come. When they arrive at the battle site, a fire fight erupts. At the beginning of the battle, Flemming is motivated to fight. He then sees many of the men around him to drop dead. After seeing this horrific site, he drops his rifle and flees. While he is running from the battlefield, he is pierced by a bullet fired by a Confederate soldier. Flemming is disgusted by himself for abandoning his station. He questions his ethics and if he should return to his regiment. Ultimately, he decides to return to his comrades. They simply assumed that he was killed or lost in the heat of the battle. One of the men spot his bullet wound and believes he is a hero for staying and fighting while many men were dying around him. Henry lets the idea of being a war hero effect his ego and starts boasting of his bravery in battle. Many of the veterans of the regiment do not believe that Henry is a hero and was shot while fleeing the battle. Many of his own men mock him for his lack of bravery. When the camp receives word of another battle, Flemming views as a chance of redemption. The intensity of the battle was overwhelming most of the men however, Flemming was determined to redeem himself.

I for one, am not really sure why. It is OK, but compared to the best of Hemingway, Roth, Heller, etc. it is like comparing backyard badmitton with your nephew to the NFL.What is most interesting is how literature has changed in 100+ years. Crane wrote this thing as a magazine serialization, which does not exist anymore to my knowledge. Red Badge is also full of wind-bag characters who never get to the point, and the ending is rather ambivalent. The protagonist does not really have a name, he is a coward, and there is no love interest except his mother, who only appears on the first 10 pages.Other than that, this thing is OK. Crane was too young to have been in the Civil War, so to his credit he did impeccable and thorough research with veterans, mostly conducted in saloons. Crane personally was a disaster, his life was not much longer than this novel.But seriously, read the Red Badge if you did not do so in high school. The descriptions of the battles, especially the confusion, chaos, inability to establish objectives, focus, or leadership, is not what is portrayed in John Wayne movies. The protagonist is very unsure about his future and his role in the war; this is a great theme that Crane did not develop fully in this tiny book. But there is great insight into why the men fought, what motivated them, and how they were inspired to take on impossible, dangerous, and mindless tasks."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book was long, boring, repetative and hard to understand.

(It will be referenced more than read, however.) For a twenty-two-year-old guy to write a book with that kind of longevity is pretty remarkable...but I'd also reckon that no one will seriously ascribe the designation of \\"masterpiece\\" to it even then, perhaps because Stephen Crane WAS so young and unseasoned.Under the Volcano is a masterpiece. Lolita is a masterpiece. The Red Badge of Courage is a worthy (second echelon) inclusion into American literature, but it is not in any way supernal.My edition (Washington Square Press) suffered from a dreadful job of proofreading (typos, sentence-repeats, etc.), and Crane's sentences can, at times, be wholly pedestrian. The immaturity is apparent, despite the obvious gifts of the author, and the book is--apart from two passages--rather tedious.Those two passages are sump'n else, though: The expiry of Jim Conklin may be the best death scene I've ever read. Crane here achieves transcendence in a way that is nowhere present in the rest of the book. We get a glimpse of Crane's potential: What if he could muster that magic on a more consistent basis? What kind of book might The Red Badge of Courage have been had Crane been ten years older when he wrote it?The other superior passage relates the charge of the Union soldiers on the second day of battle. Crane captures, distills, and bottles the essence of battle: the confusion, smoke, distorted sensory perception, etc.That still leaves about one-hundred and fifty pages, however. Those pages aren't bad...but, well, they won't have you burning the midnight oil, either.But this is still a book that SHOULD be read--moreso if you're an American--and it won't tax your time overmuch to finish it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"If you're a person who reads historical fiction,this the perfect book for you.

The story opens with a young soldier (Henry Fleming) preparing to leave his home to fight in the war. His mother is not ecstatic in his leaving, but Henry goes anyway.

Along the way, the young soldiers are praised and glorified by townspeople as being gods. This boosts the self-esteem and courage of the soldiers; this is a new but very transient feeling. Fighting soon commences, and the teens are shocked into horror at the sights, sounds, and even smell they encounter.

Stephan Crane wants to show the reader the true side of war, which is anything but good.

As Henry struggles with disappointment for running away, he gradually gains the courage he desperately needs and wants to rejoin his battalion.

I am a major Crane fan and think him one of America's greatest writers but believe Red is inferior to his short stories. However, it is still significant and enjoyable. A true classic, it is highly recommended for fans of realism, naturalism, and Crane as well as Civil War buffs.It is rightly revered as an accurate, compelling Civil War story but is not what most will expect. No epic war tale, it is in fact very short and goes into detail about only one battle. However, Civil War veterans marveled at how stunningly and movingly well Crane conveyed what the war was really like, specifically his focus on the human element all too often missing in histories. Time has if anything only increased admiration of this angle. This is all the more remarkable in that Crane was born after the war and had no battle experience; his ability to get inside soldiers' heads and vividly recreate their world - one so unimaginable to nearly everyone - is truly incredible. All this of course gives significant historical value.Perhaps even more impressive is that Red revolutionized war's literary portrayal. It has no glorious, hard fought battles or conventional mighty heroes; appeals to masculinity, strength, and other primal urges ubiquitous since Homer are notably absent. Crane shows what war is really like for the average soldier: scary, surreal, and immensely intimidating. Henry Fleming, the protagonist, bit off far more than he could proverbially chew just like millions and millions of soldiers throughout history. The book details his pained, uncertain journey; the vague but very real fear, pressing doubts, and sheer cowardice consuming him are familiar to far more soldiers than will ever admit it. Red severely undercuts the ancient clich&eacute; of glorious war, depicting it as truly awful in every sense of the word. This did not become standard until after World War I, showing just how far ahead of his time Crane was as well as his immense eventual influence.Yet, in the end, Fleming learns from his experiences, achieving a kind of courage and even glory at least as great in its way as - and in many ways far more real than - any illustrious soldier's in history or myth. The book is thus also a bildungsroman; Fleming moves from navet&eacute; and ignorance to hard-won, if unconventionally gained, knowledge of humanity's and life's dark side. Crane's other work is far more piercing here, with Red focusing more on relatively positive and practical applications. Even so, the book was significantly far ahead of its time in this regard also, positing a complex view of identity and how it is influenced by environment and other factors. Despite brevity, simple prose, and a straight-forward story, Red is therefore one of the first truly modern novels.I strongly urge anyone who likes this to read Crane's short stories, which have considerably more artistry and depth. However, this is a good entry point and a book that all Americans - as well as anyone else interested in its elements - should read for many reasons, not least its unflinching look at the dark side of the nation's darkest conflict."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I will direct my review to \\"Red Badge\\", for the first two stories the gifted young writer wasted his prose on the pathetic lives of a couple suburban families; they were not very interesting, nor enriching.Though in \\"Red Badge\\", Crane brought out uniquely beautiful and detailed prose with the characters written in the dialect of the day. He put more into this rather short story than a book ten times its size, though the momentum slowed the last quarter. The story is about a young soldier searching for courage, meaning and justification while fighting in a single battle during the Civil War. He was out to prove himself after running from his first skirmish. After receiving his wound (red badge of courage) he began to writhe in guilt in the way he received it. As time past he became cocky, and he fooled himself and others into believing a different battle tale.Crane's style can add to your writing skills, though be wary, his \\"lostness\\" does radiate in his words.Lord blessScott"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Henry was a young man who enlisted in the union army during the American civil war to test his courage. He wanted to know if he would run away from battle or if he would stand firm and fight like a man. He selfishly left his mother alone to weep for him, and only as he walked away did he realize what harm he had done to her. When he arrived at his regiment, Henry was deeply troubled by his thoughts of courage and cowardliness. He wondered if what he was doing was right. At his first battle, he ran away and observed what was going on with other regiments. After struggling some time with his conscience, Henry joined a group of wounded soldiers who were slowly traveling to the rear of the fighting army. After this, he met an old friend from his regiment named Jim and a new friend who asked him where his wound was located. When he was asked the question, Henry quickly walked away and avoided the curious soldier. However, the old soldier found Henry and Jim again when Jim was in so much pain and agony that he was about to die. Henry and the older soldier watched in dismay as Jim fell to the ground, glad to end his life. Henry then deserted the old soldier and later was sulking around feeling sorry for himself when he saw hundreds of men fleeing from the southern soldiers. He was trying to ask someone what was going on when he got knocked in the head with a gun. He found someone who helped him back to his regiment. When Henry arrived there, his friends wrongly assumed that his wound was a war wound. He joined in more battles and eventually became a hero. When the battles were over, Henry was quite pleased with himself. Whether he remained in the army or went home remains a mystery amongst the readers of The Red Badge of Courage.Henry was merely reacting to guilt and the higher expectations of the men around him when he went to his second battle, but he soon realized that his selflessness was becoming genuine. In the end, Henry had chosen to become a hero and learn from his mistakes. He learned to put the past behind him and look toward the future. The only thing useful that he could get out of looking at his past was being able to know what mistakes not to make. Henry discovered that he had a second chance. He really grew after he went through battle and he saw that growth in his friends too.

The author did a magnificent job of conveying the conflicting thoughts of the young, immature protagonist, Henry Fleming. The actions and silent, self-absorbed musings of the naive central character rang true. You get to see the virgin soldier's childish fantasies come face to face with the harsh realities of war. It's no wonder pugnacious fellows like President Theodore Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway got their rocks off on this blood-soaked book. Back on the eve of the 20th century when Mr. Crane's work was published, war was looked upon as some kind of barbaric baptism needed to become a \\"real\\" man.

The story centers on the dissonances between his childlike perceptions of war based on Greek epics of Homer and his self preservation in the face of death. The story starts with Henry's misguided presumptions of war. He is vain and hypersensitive. He wants to be a hero and he sees war and his best bet is to get off the farm. In the end, he develops a new view of war as well as his place in the world. His path of transformation takes him through the nameless faceless ranks of the army. Few fellow soldiers are identified by name. Rather, brief encounters describe such soldiers as an unnamed mysterious advocate who comforts him when he is lost and \\"tattered man.\\"Henry's delusional \\"Homeric\\" ideals of war come crashing down through a myriad of emotions including fear, hopelessness, insecurity and anger. Crane depicts several situations that are intimately human. With a few words of conversation, he conveys volumes of emotion. For example, when Henry tells his mother that he has enlisted, he is forced to listen to her unexpected harangue. He anticipated a hero's send-off and imagined a salutation such as \\"returning with his shield or on it (p. 5).\\" However, his mother lectures him about manners and falling into bad repute. After which, Crane describes Henry's reaction as \\"He had, of course, been impatient under the ordeal of this speech. It had not been quite what he expected, and he had borne it with an air of irritation. He departed felling vague relief (p.7).\\"Crane intentionally loses the reader's orientation to time and place. He is clearly not trying to retell the specific historical events of a battle. He is creating the inner battle of young boy who has built up aspirations of heroics in his mind fall like a house of cards in the realties of war. Henry's Self preservation usurps his heroic intentions:\\"In his flight the sound of these following footsteps gave him his one meager relief. He felt vaguely that death must make a first choice of men who were nearest; the initial morsels for the dragons would be then those who were following him. So he deployed the zeal of an insane sprinter in this purpose to keep them I the rear.

He chances upon a \\"Tattered man\\" who's simple question \\"Were you hit?\\" sends Henry into a tailspin of guilt and shame. He actually started to look at injured soldiers with envy:\\"At time he regarded the wounded soldiers in an envious way. He conceived persons with torn bodies to be peculiarly happy. He wished he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage (p. 66).\\"After returning to his unit, he is accepted and eventually does achieve a certain level of heroism and notoriety. However, in the end, Henry finds inner peace by realizing there is a larger context to which he humbly belongs:\\"The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war.

Some soldiers believe this man and begin to panic, but others believe that their regiment will never move into battle. Henry Fleming chooses to lay down and think nothing of their conversations. In his solitude Henry becomes rather excited to hear that they will finally be able to fight and that he will be able to finally fulfill his dream of becoming a war hero. After a while Henry begins to think of old war stories he had heard from veterans and begins to think that he will not be able to cope with the mental and physical stresses of war.When his regiment begins to march Henry must remind himself that he has to stay with his fellow soldiers and not flee in order to become a hero. While marching along Henry sees his first corpse and shows sorrow for the man who had died in such poor conditions. This man's corpse causes Henry to question whether or not his generals understand what they are doing. While he believes that they are being led right into a trap, Henry deals with his uncertainty by acting calmly and confidently like an experienced veteran.The next day Regime 304 moves into battle and instead of fighting it out like a hero, Henry becomes scared and decides to hide among some brush to avoid being shot. As he hears cheers from what\`s left of his regiment Henry flees into the woods in anger, as his conscience tells him he is a coward Henry chooses to return to the battle. Henry meets up with an older man from his regiment and is asked if he is injured. Feeling guilty he shrugs away from this man and returns to the woods. From behind a tree he is able to see all the wounded soldiers and begins to wish he had a wound of his own, something he could call is own red badge of courage.Overall, I personally liked this novel from Stephen Crane because it is an accurate portrayal of the American Civil War. While I read it I could truly feel the mental stresses a soldier would have experienced during the challenges they faced during their battles. Crane's descriptions of the violence is intense and quite historically accurate and it allowed me to put myself in the shoes of a Unionist soldier at battle and truly feel their emotions."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I bought all the books on my daughter's AP English class list from Amazon.com's associate bookseller's program after running all over town just to find the first one on the list.

Reluctantly sent on his way from a small farm in the North, Henry excitedly signs up for the army and is eager to fight his first battle against the South. Henry finds out a lot about himself and matures quite a bit from the first battle. During the first battle, Henry flees the fight and is ashamed of himself for a while. Henry then gathers up the strength to once again give it his all, this time heroically undertaking a great role of leadership in the final battle that would indeed earn him the \\"Red Badge of Courage\\".I liked this book for a few reasons. For one, it's so nice to actually see a character develop and have very human flaws as Henry did and go to possible redemption at the end. In addition, the novel as others have said is a short, but surprisingly accurate depiction of war and not just a rosy outlook in which the main character is flawless from start to finish as well as the war in general for the North. Lastly, the length makes it a very enjoyable novel that you can finish in a day or so.For having never read the book in school, I definitely would recommend this to anyone who has done the same."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The reason I liked this book was because it described the life of a soldier in great detail.

It took too long sometimes to get to the next point, making me wonder, \\"When will I ever get to the next interesting part?\\" But the good news is you'll never be too far from the next one.

I'm glad I read it, but it does not rank among my favorite works of fiction. My favorite novels are the ones that make you feel like you're in a different place, with characters that you connect with. This was not one of those novels. Every person, place and event in the book is cast in vague terms, including Henry (\\"the youth\\") himself. Undoubtedly Stephen Crane did this on purpose, perhaps to enhance the novel's relevance and applicability. This vagueness was achieved, though, at the expense of character likeability.Henry is drawn to enlist in the Union army because he wants to be brave. After joining, he is uncertain how he will cope with the stresses of war, but he is comforted in realizing that other soldiers contemplate the same. In the first battle Henry fights bravely and feels the brotherhood among the regiment. Henry approaches the second battle reluctantly, and ends up ditching his gun and fleeing. Before reuniting with his regiment, Henry has a series of encounters that impact his psyche in various ways. When he does rejoin his regiment, he lies about fleeing and falsifies the cause of his wound. Through his fabrications, he convinces his comrades that he is indeed a brave man, and only then does he act the part.Crane has poignant insights into a soldier's mind, describing how the larger purpose of the war is drowned out by the emerging battle brotherhood. Are the soldiers fighting to win the war, or are they all there to prove their own bravery? Henry transforms from a self-serving, quick-to-flee soldier who would even wish defeat upon his own army to provide himself vindication into a brave leader of men, worthy of major general status. Henry's view of his regiment adapts to justify his actions: in victories he feels one with his regiment (\\"he could not flee no more than a little finger can commit a revolution from a hand\\"), yet after his desertment he reasons that each soldier has a responsibility to act in their own best interest. On multiple occasions, Henry sees his own death as the only means to achieve true understanding and appreciation. I enjoyed how Crane contrasted Henry's brittle self-confidence (which is, after all, founded on a lie) with that of the \\"loud young soldier,\\" who became indifferent to others' words after what he'd experienced.In short, it's a classic--you've got to read it. But it's brief and it's vague, so you won't be too drawn into the characters or the setting. This novel is filled with well-articulated, widely-applicable themes. It's got powerful messages, but it just wasn't that enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book was ordered as part of a bundle of textbooks needed for the Spring 2013 semester.

Henry Fleming is a country boy who joins the Union Army. In the war he has two friends and they are all scared about what could happen to them. At the beginning, Henry thinks that war will be exciting but when he gets into a battle he realizes that war is a terrible thing. He runs away when the shooting starts. Later he finds his friend who has been seriously wounded. Soon after his friend dies. He meets up with other soldiers that are in a battle and gets hit in the head with a rifle. He has gotten his red badge of courage. He finds his regiment and fights a battle and is determined to be a hero.I disliked the book because Henry Fleming and his band of troops spoke really bad English and I sometimes couldn't understand what they were saying. I also disliked the book because Henry acted weird in the beginning. He was a coward and had a bad temper. This is a good book for historians and people who were born in 1860 or who likes war books."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"But it hasn't really aged well; what Crane attempts is to tell a war story that is the antithesis of the traditional, enthusiastic panegyric of heroic warriors. In 1895, this was novel and ground-breaking, and the writing style was not unlike many at that time period.But for the modern reader, there are many better examples of anti-war stories, that tell the story of the horrors of war, and the basic humanity of the participants, who are neither heroes nor cowards entirely, but always a little bit of both. And to the modern ear, the style of this book is overly flowery and elaborate, except when the author tries to capture the dialogue in the vernacular, and fails by badly overdoing it. Dialect is a tricky thing; if you render it verbatim, it sounds exaggerated. Just a touch of patois in dialogue goes a long way.Historically, this is an important novel, a major landmark in the history of American Literature, and a good source of insight into the thought process of the country at the time it was written. But it is not a book to read for its own sake, not for the modern reader."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage will keep the reader entertained, and keeps a fueling plot; however, the 3rd person narration of the book is not well written.

He wants to be brave, to fight in the war and be honored for his love for his country. But then come the doubts, the rage, the fear. And Henry, the youth, must learn the hard way what it really means to wear the red badge of courage.It's a short novel, and beautifully crafted and written and built, but it's not an easy read, per se. (I want to read it again soon because I had a to read it a little fast for my liking in order to get my homework done.) Most of the characters have names, but Crane tends to use their character handles in reference to them. Henry is most often referred to as \\"the youth.\\" There is the \\"tall soldier,\\" \\"the loud soldier,\\" etc. This is a very original and - I found - fascinating way to identify the characters, but for a reader who is not used to reading like that, it is more difficult and takes more time. Crane also uses many metaphors to describe the battefields and what \\"the youth\\" is feeling. He also uses a lot of color. And while this makes for a beautiful story with beautiful illustrations, it is a bit harder to follow.But don't let that stop you. By all means, read this book. What fasinated me most about it was the way I felt while reading it. I could picture everything perfectly. The battlescenes flowed from beginning to end, ever deathly and beautiful all in one. I almost felt like I was reading in slow motion. I could picture \\"the youth\\" scrambling in the field, avoiding every bullet and tumbling into the trees in fright. I was there, among the soldiers. I was fighting and killing and brandishing a weapon. I saw the battles in a three dimensional whirl-wind of color, with bullets singeing my face and debris cutting my skin.I wore the red badge of courage."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book is a pschological portrayal of a soldiers first experience in battle.

He tells every one he got shot the next fight he stays and fights and leads a charge. Tobias and Henry they are the same because the don't look at things realistically. the are different because when the picture gets closer Henry starts to ask questions about himself. but tobais still just see one big picture. I think that the charcter would help each other becasue Henry could help Tobais see some problems and Tobais could help encourage Henry. One man joining the union but is afried of a battle but some how finds the courage to lead his regiment to victory. yes I would recomend this book to other people because it has a good plot and some times you dont want to put the book down.I would recomend this book to people who love old time book.

Crane fills this novel with ironies and color symbolisms throughout the course of the war, which can be easily overlooked. At 129 pages, this novel covers young Henry Fleming's enlistment, training, desertion, and three days of battle. Despite the short span of time the book records, it depicts Henry entering the war as a nave young man who later matures into a brave soldier. This goes to say that one of the book's major topics includes the coming of age. All young recruits seek to emerge as men at the end of war, but later realize that the war is not the glorious affair described in Greek mythology. Although only Henry's thoughts are known, it is heavily implied in the book that other young soldiers are having conflicted feelings just like him. This in turn contributes to shaping the novel's focus more on the psychology of war than the history.The novel is a chronologically organized series of episodes as seen through Henry's eyes; although the 304th regiment was fabricated, the battle described in the novel is the real-life Battle of Chancellorsville. . By keeping the characters nameless, Crane universalizes the novel and makes the lessons applicable to any person at any given situation. Although the war is implied to be the Civil War, it is never mentioned in order to achieve the same purpose of promoting the novel's universality.Overall, the book does a so-so job at keeping the reader's interest at bay. Although events are fast-paced, the novel itself is not a page-turner - there is just never enough to capture the readers' attention. To me, Crane's technique of not using names is frustrating at times to remember who is who. If you are seeking for an exciting read, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Summary: This book is about a young man named Henry Fleming. He joins the army during the Civil War as a Union. He enlists in the army because he wanted to get the glory in the military. At first he questions his courage. He begins to get afraid of dying in the battlefield. When they are on the battlefield the first time, Henry gets cornered and starts to fire his gun. Later the Confederates attack again and he gets afraid and runs away. He sees the wounded in a camp. He starts to talk to a man who had been shot twice. The man is proud to be in the army and starts to ask Henry where he is hurt. Now Henry feels horrible for leaving his fellow friends and soldiers on the field. He goes back to the battlefield to fight where the men are retreating. While they are going back to camp, Henry gets hit in the head with a rifle. So while he is at camp with his wound he feels horrible for fleeing. The next day while they are fighting he grabs the flag and charges with it towards the Confederates. He becomes a wild soldier in combat. He starts to fight with honor for his country.Review: I thought this book was great. It showed how some soldiers felt toward war. When I think of war, I think of the people that enlist into the war without any fears or confusion. But this book shows that people join the war to represent their country but they are still afraid to die. They are leaving all their loved ones home to show honor towards their homeland. I loved this book because Henry overcomes his fears and becomes an honorary soldier.Recommendation: I recommend this book to people that love war and battle, because it is about the Civil War. Also, I would recommend this book to people with fears. I say this because Henry is a man that is afraid to die on the battlefield. Later in the book, he realizes that death will come on its own, but his guilt of cowardice for his men wouldn't.

I thought this book would be pretty interesting since it is about the Civil War and I am an American History buff. I've got one thing to say-BOY, I WAS WRONG! This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It took a half-an-hour to read five pages of this book because I had absolutely no idea what the main character was talking about or referring to. And I'm an Advanced English student! You would think I'd have some idea what the main character was talking about. But I didn't! All they do the entire book is move around from place to place. We all know the Civil War was a dramatic war. There are absolutely no dramatic scenes in this book whatsoever! I read all these things that people are saying about the author of this book, Stephen Crane. They are saying &quot;Boy, Stephen Crane really did a good job writing this book. He never fought in a war himself but he sure knew how to put a good plot in the story.&quot; Hey people, there was hardly a plot in the story! He doesn't know the first thing about a war. My grandpa read this book earlier in his life. He said it was one of the worst war books he had ever read. He was a World War Two Veteran to boot! He should know something about the effects of a war!

As it turns out, he wasn't born until 1871, six years after the war. Either way it didn't matter. I don't see why they call this book a &quot;classic&quot;. His writing is hard to understand and harder to interpret in even the most shallowest of ways. It's not just because of his time period. I've read Twain and his books were 10 times easier to understand, even with his usage of dialogue. You know what, forget Crane and just head over to Twain, who is more worthy of your time. (Not to mention your money"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"How do some books of low merit make it to lists of the \\"100 All-Time Great Books\\" or \\"100 Books Every Schoolchild Must Read\\" - and remain there despite a conspicuous lack of merit. I suspect they are put there because assorted critics, literature professors, and others read them in their youth (probably under duress) and have a vague memory that they were somehow important (if not terribly interesting), and continue to vote for them in surveys.Some more stringent sort of review process is needed, I think, based on a recent re-reading of Stephen Crane's \\"Red Badge of Courage,\\" which is on those lists. It's high time somebody took this book's reputation out back and shot it. The book lacks plot, characters, suspense, or interest. Making it mandatory reading for students should be declared unconstitutional as it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.Well, some may say, it least it gives kids an idea of what the Civil War was like. Not really. Crane wasn't born until over five years after the war was over, and wrote the book when he was 22, before having been in, or even seen, any battle, anywhere. The book is what journalists call a \\"clip job,\\" meaning an article pieced together from clippings, without any original reporting. Crane was able to give some verisimilitude to his book from photographs, magazine articles, and memoirs. And he carefully keeps the action so vague and hard-to-follow that it's hard to figure out which battle, if any, the events in the book are based on.Some commentators have suggested that the book's action is based on the Battle of Chancellorsville. Crane apparently said that once, and the book does mention the Rappahannock River, which does run by the Chancellorsville battlefield. But that river also runs by the sites of several other Civil War battles. The action described in the book doesn't really seem to fit into any of them. Chancellorsville, moreover, was a decisive Confederate victory, whereas the Union appears to be winning in the battle portrayed in \\"Red Badge of Courage.\\"There are lots of annoying little gaffes. The principal character, for example, refers to reading regular reports of heroic Union victories in the newspapers prior to enlistment. However, if his enlistment took place in the early years of the war, as is suggested, then there hadn't been any heroic Union victories to report, and wouldn't be for some time. (Gettysburg, the first real Union victory, took place two months after Chancellorsville.)Other vexing questions come up. Was the principal character working on the family farm, or attending seminary, or both? And what kind of a seminary? It seems like an interesting place, enrolling pretty girls to whom the narrator bids fond farewell. Somehat unusual for that time. One would like to know more. But like almost everything else in the book the principal character's background is kept vague and unclear.Indeed the principal character, whose name is Henry Fielding, but who is usually referred to as \\"the youth,\\" is so thinly sketched (we don't even know what he looks like) that the reader has no particular reason to care whether he lives or dies. This reader figured that would depend on whether Crane ultimately decided to make his book an anti-war or pro-war book. (As it turns out Crane keeps this vague too.)Indeed, none of the characters are developed in any meaningful way, and there's no attempt to portray the \\"band of brothers\\" camaraderie which is an essential element of all authentic combat stories. Just as Fielding is called \\"the youth,\\" his buddies are also given generic, \\"Brand X\\" names like \\"the tall soldier\\" or \\"the tattered man.\\" They're like extras who have been sent over from central casting to do a walk-on.The plot, such as it is, consists of following Fielding through the course of a battle. At first he panics and runs, then he returns and stands resolute against an attack, and finally turns hero as he takes up his unit's battle flag and leads his fellows in a rout of the enemy. In between he has various encounters with other soldiers and his own internal demons.He gets his \\"red badge of courage\\" when he annoys a passing soldier from another unit by grabbing onto him and asking senselessly, \\"Why, why, why?\\" The other soldier terminates the conversation by giving Fielding a horizontal butt stroke upside the head with his rifle. When Fielding returns to his unit, his fellows assume the wound was a bullet graze caused by the enemy, and he doesn't correct them. Some people think this is marvelous irony. This reader thought it was just silly.The narrative feels like it was made up. It is wandering and confusing - never compelling.

I just read the Red Badge of Courage by Stephan Crane and I thought it was bad becuase it was a very slow. boring. and repetitive book. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a boy named Henry and his thoughts and feelings as he went through different battles and challanges of war. In this book I enjoyed the part when it ended and in whch Henry met the 3 men his regiment captured from the Confederates. If I could change anything in this story it would be the ending I thought it was bad and just left the story unfinished. It was almost like Stephan Crane wanted to finish it as quickly as possible and took the first chance he got. I do recommend this book to people over 50 years of age and people who can't take to much of anything at one time.

Camp life proved monotonous. He was drilled. He had a serious problem. He was afraid he would run from battle.

The men marched and the regiment lost its newness. Still the group was too large, too uniform, roo bright and colorful to be a group of veterans.Then, one morning, the time for war had come. Henry was in a moving box. It would be impossible to escape from the regiment. Stopping, the men dug in the ground like terriers. Henry had been taught a man became another thing in battle. This was to be his salvation. There was an imprint on the faces of the men who had been in battle. The youth shot with his rifle. He lost concern for himself and became a member of his unit. He felt anger against swirling battle phantoms. A lieutenant helped him reload his gun. The atmosphere was foul. The captain had been killed.

The Red Badge of Courage. New Jersey: TransactionPublishers, 1997.Review by Miraya PotterThe Red Badge of Courage is a novel about the character of a soldier named Henry during the battle at Chancellorsville in 1863. This novel shows you the emotions of the soldiers families, the heartache of death in a war, and how the soldiers felt and the thought process they went through. At the beginning of the novel it reveals the strong and emotional feelings that Henry's mother felt about him leaving. Her face \\"was stained with tears\\" when he left for war. His mother is a very strong character and cared for her son deeply. Another strong character is Wilson. Wilson is one of the main reasons as to why Henry became brave and courageous. Once Henry realized that Wilson had doubts and fears, he felt comfort in knowing that he was not the only one with fear. That moment was a tremendous turning point for Henry. Henry entered the army with romantic feelings about the war, however once he was confronted with the reality of war he became scared. As time passed he began to get more and more used to the ideas of war and soon became a \\"wild cat\\" in battle, according to his lieutenant.

It's about the Civil War, with details about a Union soldier's daily life and his thoughts and his incompetencies. What's amazing about the book is that Stephen Crane never saw combat.The story is simple. That's what makes it great. It reveals inner demons that all people, except the Audie Murphys and the Alvin Yorks of the world, confront during combat. It's the self-doubt, the worry, the concern, the fear. What isn't simple, however, is the battle and the how the emotions and fears multiply and come to fruition during times of great distress. Combat does hell to a man.The protagonist of the story runs from his first battle and feels ashamed. He eventually rationalizes the hasty retreat, thinking of himself as an intelligent person, knowing when the battle could not be won; and therefore, he ran. It's the mark of a truly advanced mind. Unfortunately, his fellow troops won the battle.The youth's conscience begins to eat at him. He feels even worse than before. He hates himself, and then starts to realize that an even worse fate awaits: The fate of being discovered as a coward. He decides to return to his regiment, but loses his way, finding himself among other Union soldiers. He's asked by a clearly wounded soldier where his wounds are, and the mere question pains him deeper than a wound probably could. He wishes for his own \\"red badge of courage\\", a wound to prove that he was willing to stand his ground a fight, to show bravery. He eventually gets a \\"badge\\", but only because a fellow soldier blasts him in the head with the butt of a rifle.When he returns to his own unit, his fellow soldiers recognize his injury, his \\"badge\\", and know that he must have been hit by shrapnel. The youth lies, and accepts the care that is given.Ultimately, one more opportunity is presented. The youth gets to show his merit in battle. It's the new and final test of everything within his body, his soul, his test of bravery and courage. The youth seems to have learned his lessons, and has become a \\"better\\" man because of it; he's now a warrior, a soldier who can tell tales of heroism and bravery to his relatives.\\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" is a masterpiece of American fiction, and in my view it's the best account of the Civil War. It's amazing writing, impeccably told stories, and gruesome details that show the horror of war. It's, very simply, a classic."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When the young boy, Henry, heard of a near by recruiting center for the Civil War he decided to join immediately. Despite what Henry's mother told him he enlisted with the North in hopes of an adventure and a good time. The war turned out to be much different than he could have expected because days after he joined the Union Army his regiment began a march south towards battle. After hearing different opinions about the war life Henry shakes with fear for how he would react on the battlefield. The war enfolds as Henry finds himself completely shocked to be in his first battle. Once he got wounded he desperately retreated and later joined up with another regiment, which had some of his friends in it from his original regiment. Henry toughens up when his new regiment is sent into another battle. He made a great influence on his regiment to fight and win their battle. The war came to an end and Henry looked back on his accomplishments with a smile. The Red Badge of Courage is an excellent book filled with plenty action, details and well thought out characters to fit their time period.Many books begin their stories with just a boring introduction to introduce the characters and setting but in the Red Badge of Courage there was action from the first chapter until the last chapter. The book began with Henry immediately enlisting with the Union Army within the first couple of pages and following that event was Henry's regiment's march south. Henry fought in two battle and several small fights during his adventure. He went through many adventures to finally make himself proud. The key battle Henry took place in was the battle where he carried his regiment's flag into battle, which made all of the other soldiers follow him to glory.Stephen Crane described all of the key elements of the story very well to give the reader a clear image of what was occurring as they were reading. \\"The thick fog was layering the field as distant lights could be seen followed by a blast\\" was an example of the description of the battles in the story. He also explained daily camp life during the war, which seemed to be accurate with the actual war. Crane described what the camps looked like and all of the various things the soldiers were doing to entertain themselves such as playing music, cards, and even fighting sometimes.Henry, Jim and Wilson who are the three main characters were described very well within the story. Crane described their personality through how they act. Jim responded to Henry that if the regiment retreated he would also but if the regiment stayed and fought he would do the same. Jim is the kind of guy that likes getting the job done and doesn't complain too much about it but still have opinions on the matters. Wilson began the war as a loud soldier who argues a lot and then suddenly changed into a quiet soldier realizing the horrors of battle. He settled down into a quieter person and began fearing death and the war. The main character of the story, Henry, was an adventurous boy in the beginning of the story that was searching for action and found it but more than he could handle causing him to change into a coward. He transformed back into an adventurous boy again and led his regiment into battle.The Red Badge of Courage was a well-written book about the life of a single Union solider who transformed himself during his experiences during the war. Anyone who enjoys action books about war should undoubtedly read this book. Stephen Crane constructed a masterpiece that everyone should read. Each page is filled with a surprise and action to make the story one of the most thrilling novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"RED BADGE OF COURAGEThis Civil War had just started. Henry Flemming wanted to sign up really badly, but his mom didn't want him to. He signed up anyways, and she congratulated him. He thought this was going to be the beginning of a good war. He camps out in the same place for a very long time while people in his regiment keep saying they are going to fight soon. Finally they actually do get to fight. At the battle, they fight off the confederates. Everyone thought that was an easy battle. Much to their dismay, the confederates that had ran and then came back with reinforcements. When Henry sees this, he runs in fright. Even though him and a great deal of the regiment ran away, the rest that stayed one the battle. Everyone who stayed and fought had a battle scare, a red badge of courage, and Henry decided he wanted one too. He decided he wasn't going to run away from a fight again. Afterwards he became committed to the squad, and was promoted to drummer boy, and he fought with another squad for a battle. His squad stays together and he lives until, the end of the war. I think that this was a great story and taught a good lesson. I would suggest this book to anyone.I liked how they used the name of the book in the story. In the book after the battle, Henry says to himself that he wants a red badge of courage, just like all of the rest. The name of the book actually encouraged the main character into staying in the battles. Making the title be in such a great and inspiring part of the book was good as well.I also like how he wasn't actually fighting, but became the drummer boy and led the army into battle. Having him lead the army made him a lot more important to the story. Also him being drummer boy made him a character that contributes more to the squad. It makes Henry have more of a point in the story.And I like how the author always referred to Henry as \\"the Youth\\". I liked that because that was Henry's position in the army, his status, the youth. Also it made it so it didn't seem like it was in the point of view of just a narrator, but as someone who was there.I really enjoyed reading this book, and I think many other people could to if they read it.

Along the way, the young soldiers are praised and glorified by townspeople as being gods. This boosts the self-esteem and courage of the soldiers; this is a new but very transient feeling. Fighting soon commences, and the teens are shocked into horror at the sights, sounds, and even smell they encounter.

Language could have been a little cleaner, but enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"When you see the title, your thoughts are justly specific: a close-up look at a Civil War battle experienced through the eyes of a single young soldier, teenager Henry Fleming. The novel certainly earns its classics status based on its original realistic depiction of war. It memorably captures the fire and brimstone of battle, the wanton carnage of the battlefield, the massive dueling for miniscule feet of ground, the rampant rumors of ill-informed troops, and the agony of disabling wounds and agonizing deaths. Contemporaneous luminaries the likes of H.G. Wells and Joseph Conrad praised the novel and Crane. Hemingway found himself influenced by it.But the novel holds rewards beyond the visceral noise, stink, and color of conflict. It provides an amazing and penetrating exploration of the psychological state of a nave youth forced to mature almost instantly in the most heated crucible imaginable. The plot isn't about winning or losing a battle; it's about a youth coming to terms with his personal concepts of morality, loyalty, courage, and, ultimately, his place in a world that spins on, indifferent to his life and that of his comrades and enemy. Over the short length of the novel, over the brief period of battle, Henry Fleming passes from romantic, idealistic youth, to fear-ravaged warrior; from a boy to a man; from one who acquires his red badge ignobly and who truly earns it by the time the blare and chaos recedes, at least until it flares up again.Highly recommended, especially to everybody who read it with apathy in high school and who now carry their own battle scares."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Great addition to my collection of classics.

The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane writes about how soldiers acted in the civil war and how they acted during battle. When the battle started it was a true test of character and (like in the title) courage.The book starts off when it tells of Henry at his originally stationed position near his family. They move out to fight in the first battle of the war. This is where young Henry first realizes that war is a bloody and gory thing. He ran without firing a shot after he saw most of the battle. He ran and ran until he found another regiment. In his second battle he fires his first shot and he starts fighting more and more. After the fight he saw all the soldiers who survived walking back, most with wounds and bandaged arms. Those were their red badges of courage, leading Henry to search for his own. During his journey he deserted again and tried to convince himself that he didn't need the badge to be respected. While he subconsciously knows that it is the only reason he is still fighting. Then in his final fight he stays and fights. Near the end of the fight, he was shot. Luckily for him it didn't hit anything major, leaving him to go to the medical tent and get his badge of courage patched up.The book tries to give the message that you will never achieve something without work. He goes off and fights in some of the battles but he doesn't really fight until his last stand. This is when he achieved his goal. One thing that I liked in this book is the description of the battles. They paint a description in your head of how the soldiers thought when they were fighting. The way some stayed and fought while others fled when they felt the first rush of fear course through their blood. It felt real when he wrote the way that they spoke with the southern accent. With sentences like, \\"wel ya shulda non dat.\\" I didn't like however when he left the battles, he made you feel lost in his thoughts. It was like you were listening to his thoughts at one point then right away it was talking about where he was going.While going through the book you think of reasons why he is doing the things he is. When he lies about thinking he got shot in the head when he was really just hit by the butt stock on a gun. Stephen wrote many books like The Open Boat and The Blue Hotel. I would recommend this book to anybody who is into history or the Civil War, this is why I would consider it a piece of American Literature.(Word Count 494)"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I downloaded this classic to assist my grandson with a school assignment.

Initially, he is consigned to endless marching, seemingly without purpose, amid arrogant boasting and complaints from those in his regiment. Henry wonders how he'll react once he actually sees battle: will he stand and fight, or turn and run. He does both - firing wildly and prematurely in the initial skirmish, but running scared during the second push when he perceives danger and defeat. He seeks to justify his actions (mostly to himself) and eventually winds up being hit in the head by another soldier before being reunited with his regiment, a wound he portrays to his fellows as having been \\"shot in the head.\\" But when the second battle comes, he uses his false courage (as well as an insult from a General) to stand and fight, and even surprises himself in the fray as he manages to lead a charge. At the end of the story, he feels he has earned a measure of courage and manhood.While I found the story strangely compelling and at times hard to put down, I also found it rather difficult to understand and follow. And I don't mean the \\"rural dialect\\" which was very well done. What I found confusing was the chaotic descriptions of the events. Often I couldn't understand or follow if what was being described was happening to Henry or if he was witnessing it elsewhere or merely imagining it. Nonetheless, this is a book that tugs at your emotions. From Henry's fear to his shamefulness at running from the battle, to his immature boasting (when he hadn't really done anything), to his eventual courage under pressure, it left me feeling quite troubled by the story. It probably didn't help that I kept expecting him to earn a \\"red badge of courage\\" and some horrible ending. I suspect that this is a novel that requires a more careful and considered reading than I gave it, and I may read it again in the future to get a better understanding of the story."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"While in junior high I failed to jump on The Red Badge of Courage bandwagon when everyone chose it as a book report book because of its length. I am sorry I missed out. The length certainly makes this book easy and accessible to people of all ages, but it is so much more. Not only is it very fast paced, unpredictable, and the best character study I've ever read, but it is timeless. It is about war, specifically the Civil War, but there are no politics or specifics about that war, it is about the emotions of a youth at war and the world through his eyes. There is no difference between what he is thinking as his regiment is charging and what a 20 year old in a modern war would feel. Though Crane had never seen a war before writing this book, he paints an incredibly powerful, honest, and realistic portrayal. It is a fantastic book and one that deserves a very careful, detailed reading, but can also be enjoyed and finished in a couple hours."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is an interesting story in many ways. The tale follows a young Union soldier named Henry Fleming for a day or two as he cuts his teeth in Civil War battle. Simple enough. But the intrigue is how author Stephen Crane--born nearly two decades after the war--could have written such an accurate-sounding depiction of battle. We read the book in present day with the benefit of having viewed countless images of Civil War battles in movies, television, and real-life reenactments, and after reading many books on the subject (i.e., The Killer Angels, The Last Full Measure, The Civil War, etc.). It's easy to forget that he didn't witness the war, nor had he witnessed any war at that point in his life. And publishing it in 1895, Crane never had the luxury of movies. Yet, Crane's account still rings true. The battle scenes come from a vivid imagination and, no doubt, newspaper articles and old photos. It is a commendable accomplishment that has stood the test of time.Another interesting aspect is that the book is not plot-based in the mold of a Dickens novel. It is essentially a \\"slice of life\\" piece. Crane drops us into the action just before Fleming faces his first battle. We aren't told where or when this battle takes place. We don't know who the senior commanders involved are or whether the scene is fact-based or total fiction. And it doesn't matter. The particulars on who's fighting, why they're fighting, and whether they're winning is immaterial to Crane. His focus is not on the glory or spectacle of war, nor the ultimate goals. His book is a study in fear and courage. Henry Fleming is scared to die. But he's more afraid that he'll panic and run, exposing cowardice. Death is not something the living can comprehend. Shame in the face of comrades is.There is also an interesting contrast between the gore of battle and Crane's poetic prose. Not a book that will change your life, but worth the quick read it presents. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"You've got read this book. It's extrodanary, superb, awsome, fantastic, defiant, unique, and definitley worth reading, if you ask me. This is the second greatest war novel ever written. It stands right behind CATCH-22 and right ahead of THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI. Stephen Crane did a wonderful job, unlike some authors. Everything is well discribed, from the setting, to the action, and even to the emotions and feelings of the main character, Henry.

But Crane's real object in this work is the human mind and spirit, especially human capriciousness, vanity, and the powerful instinct to constantly justify and elevate oneself and one's actions in one's mind. This work is a blow-by-blow study in the human ego, its folly, and its ultimate vacuity. What is probably even harder to take than watching one's comrades drop in agony like flies to no good purpose is recognizing, though a fickle fighter's internal monologue, one's own deeply entrenched patterns of defensiveness, rationalization and self-justification, along with our constant scramble to seize the credit for anything at all, things we constantly indulge in whether objective circumstances warrant them or not.Herein lies for me the great value of this expos&eacute; of what we futilely try so hard to do in all we do, down to the most mundane of everyday transactions. For this reason, I recommend this book highly, whatever your age, and regardless of your preconceptions about war novels."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is a classic American novel about a boy, who is changed into a man during his experiences in the Civil War. The book does a good job of showing this progression from start to end. In the beginning the protagonist, Henry Fleming, is a scared, young, and inexperienced soldier, who fears that he will run from his first battle. However, at the end of the novel, Henry and his friend Wilson lead the regiment to victory over the rebels.The thing that Crane does very well in his book is to make a very realistic environment. The story is set in the country, which has many forests, rivers, and fields. The soldiers in the story must overcome these obstacles as they fight the enemy. Also, Crane uses rural dialect to add more depth to conversations that the soldiers have amongst themselves. Flashbacks are used in this novel to recall experiences in Henry's past. For example, Henry has a flashback in the beginning chapter of the novel that tells readers why Henry has enlisted in the army.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good war novel, and is in high school, or older. However, even if you don't like war stories, you might still enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The battle has ceased. The enemy has fled. Yet one soldier continues to fire at the absent presence of the enemy, with the most savage appearance. Like a man-killing machine, he strives at nothing. The other soldiers stand awestruck at his persistence toward the enemy. Would you believe that same soldier fled from the scene of his first battle? Henry Fleming is that soldier in which the book, \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\", by Stephen Crane, is based upon. When Fleming entered the Civil War, he was like a young pup, helpless, weak, and frightened. As he grew, his fight was not on the battlefield of war, but under his bullet-prone chest, the heart. He continued to battle internal struggles from the shame of running from battle. Providence led him back to his regiment and after overcoming his fear, he turned into a ravenous wolf, in his aspiration to become a man.Crane desired to portray war as it actually happened. \\"Stephen Crane is credited with the introduction of social realism into American literature\\". There is also color symbolism throughout the book pertaining to the colors red and yellow, which usually represent death. \\"He was being looked at by a dead man who was seated with his back against a column-like tree. The corpse was dressed in a uniform that once had been blue but was now faded to a melancholy shade of green. The eyes, staring at the youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen on the side of a dead fish. The mouth was opened. Its red had been changed to an appalling yellow. Over the grey skin of the face ran little ants. One was trundling some sort of a bundle along the upper lip.\\" This exquisitely depicts his \\"realist\\" writing style and also contains color symbolism. Crane's writing style can be hard to understand and get in depth at times, but even the below-average-reader can enjoy this book. If you are looking for a good Civil War novel that describes a soldier's fear and feelings in a precise way, this is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This novel, first published in 1895, is one of the most gritty and vivid portrayals of combat in the history of literature. Author Stephen Crane not only accurately captures the intensity of combat, but also the day-to-day tedium of the soldier's life, the confusing lack of communication on the battlefield, and the taxing physical and mental toll on the combatants. Crane subverts the tradition of the epic war novel, stripping away the romance to reveal the realistic hopes and fears of a reluctant warrior. The Red Badge of Courage tells the story of Henry Fleming (usually referred to simply as \\"the youth\\"), a new enlistee in the Union army. Henry enters the war with grandiose notions of achieving honor and glory. When his regiment finally proceeds to the battlefield, however, Henry begins to question his own valor and wonders if he will run in the heat of battle. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and Henry does flee. Troubled with shame and remorse for this lack of cowardice, he resolves to redeem himself, fight with bravery, and earn back his pride and his manhood, even if it costs him his life.Stylistically, this book represents a turning point in American literature. On the one hand Crane builds upon the naturalistic narrative style of classic writers like Tolstoy and Zola. On the other hand, by focusing on the psychological dimensions of war rather than on actual historical events, he exhibits the nascent stirrings of modernism. Due to this unique internal perspective on combat, the book was hailed for its innovation and unconventionality. While there's no doubt this novel was ground breaking for its time, the effect on the 21st century reader is less than stunning.Although The Red Badge of Courage takes place during the American Civil War, there's little that ties it to any specific time, place, or battle. The book is more of a universal statement on war than a depiction of any specific conflict. In striving for this universality, however, Crane unintentionally alienates the reader. The character of Henry stands as a symbol for Man in War, but ultimately fails to resemble a living, breathing person. Crane tries so hard to make his protagonist an Everyman, he only succeeds in making him a nobody. While any human being can empathize on a basic level with Henry's thoughts and emotions, his utter ambiguity hinders any truly meaningful involvement or identification on the part of the reader. Like the other ciphers he encounters in the book--the tall soldier, the loud soldier, the tattered soldier--he bears little more individuality than the horses that populate the battlefield. Crane writes brilliant prose, crafting poetically powerful scenes of carnage, but the overall structure of the novel, or lack thereof, is disappointing. Despite the brevity of the book, it is quite repetitive in its themes. Henry's mind set constantly vacillates between the shame of cowardice and the desire for glory. The pointlessness of war, the incompetence of the commanders, and the cluelessness of the participants are all relentlessly hammered home. The final message of the book, however, remains unclear. Through his depiction of battle as haphazard, undignified, and futile, Crane undermines the illusion of the glory of war, yet in the end he seems to argue that it's an essential illusion, necessary for the transformation of boys to men.Historically, the Red Badge of Courage has rightfully earned its place in the hallowed halls of American literature, but whether it's deserving of a spot on the bookshelf of the contemporary reader is debatable. If you really like war stories, it's a safe bet you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I \\"buy\\" lots of free Kindle books.

I thought that the book was very slow and took awhile to make me want to read more. The only character that I felt a connection with was Henry, a young man that went into the Civil War. It was Henry that I connected with because he made realize in our lives everyone is looking for courage. When he went into war and then ran away because he thought that his side would be defeated I was angry. Then when he found the courage inside after seeing Jim die and letting another man die while watching him I felt a little bit happy for him. The most exciting part of the book was when he became the person who carried the flag. It was the high point of his courage and it made me beign to like him again. All in all though I didnt like the way Crane wrote the book and thought it was confusing at times. On several different occasions I read a section then had to re-read because I didn't understand the point he was trying to get across. In the end though, I do respect Henry and his sense of courage after the many times of doubting his own courage.Patrick White-Overland Park, KS"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I liked this book, but found myself far removed from loving it. The characters are unlikable, the situation they are in, given from the protagonist's standpoint is highly depressing, and the outcome from the beginning of the novel is surely going to end badly. Without totally ruining the book, the only thing that made this book good was also what made it a trial to read. The 'battle personas' that people put on, and the way people change in battle are as true in the book as in real life, and reflect military life very well and in a very realistic fashion.However, what is odd is that Crane's vision ends with a grain of wisdom for the protagonist, and I think it is perhaps received a little too easily. Why would the youth go through countless situations without proper attainment of some kind of wisdom, entering into the futile cycle of war and glory in his mind, and somehow come up with a satisfying answer without any kind of triggering reason for him to do so? The lack of mental cause for such a burst of wisdom and personal peace seems to be out of line with the character's personality as a whole, since from the beginning, the youth was a poor hand at self-reasoning and personal reflection. While the author may try and pass this off as 'battle experience' it is in the search for glory and the avoidance of humiliation that the youth is his worst, and yet there seems to be no reason why he should so easily shake his guilt for the terrible things that he did to his comrades earlier in the novel. I think for any soldier, such guilt would be much harder for someone to rid themselves of, and would certainly not happen immediately, as if it was an epiphany.However, even if the ending is a little unsatisfying, the book is certainly worth reading, as it has quite a bit of depth for its length."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge Of Courage I think is a great book because I love historical fiction.

Henry Fleming, the newest recruit to the 304th regiment, is the main character in the book. Henry is a young boy who doesn't seem to have to courage to be in the army. Their regiment rests along a riverbank, where they have been camped for weeks. At last the regiment is given orders to head out, and the soldiers spend several weary days traveling on foot. Eventually they approach a battlefield and begin to hear the distant roar of bullets and gun powder. After securing a position, the enemy charges. Henry, boxed in by his fellow soldiers, realizes that he could not run even if he wanted to so he begins to fire on the opposing enemy.Henry wakes from a brief nap to find that the enemy is again charging his regiment. Terror overtakes him this time and he leaps up and flees from the line. As he scampers across the field, he tells himself that he had done the right thing, that his regiment could not have won, and that the men who remained to fight were fools. He passes a general on horseback and overhears the commander saying that the regiment has held back the enemy charge. Ashamed of his cowardice, Henry tries to convince himself that he was right save his life. Henry finally returns to his regiment and begins fighting the very next day. In a charge, the regiment's color bearer falls.Henry takes the flag and carries it proudly before the regiment. The group is sent into more fighting, and Henry continues to carry the flag. The regiment charges a group of enemy soldiers fortified behind a fence, and wins. Wilson seizes the enemy flag and the regiment takes four prisoners. As he and the others march back to their position, Henry reflects on his experiences in the war and realizes that he has found his confidence and his peace.I think that this was a very good book because I am into these kinds of war books. In the beginning I felt that Henry was being a coward for running away but if I was in the same position, it would be hard or me to fight also. As Henry continues on his retreat, he comes across a group of men who have all been injured and he pretends to be injured himself. He only did this so that the others wouldn't know that he ran away. I think that this was Henry's lowest point in the book. After a couple more days, he finally returns to his regiment, which was a hard thing to do for him. After he helps his regiment to win their final battle, he is finally feeling very happy about himself and has found his courage after all. I think that everyone should read this book because it shows you that you can not run away from your problems."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This work is on most standard High School reading lists, as well as it should be. I first read this one over 45 years ago, and still take if off the shelf every so often and give it a reread. The author's prose is wonderful. The story is well defined. It is an excellent example of what good writing should be. The feelings the author conveys are absolutely astounding, particuarly when you know that King never expierenced war, first hand, himself. That being said, and I do not mean this in a demeaning way, I feel that many young men, and women, today, will have a bit of a problem relating to the story and the style. Perhaps it would be better to leave this one to the Honors Classes and advanced Lit. classes where the kids have probably developed a bit more than the average high schooler.

Which means the reader is never sure what the main character is going to do next in the story. The reader never knows how anyone will act from one moment to the next will they run or fight? The story is about a young enlisted soldier named Henry Fleming who goes off to war as a naive ignorant boy and returns as a man. It shows the true side of life, because Henry is acting like most young soldiers do in times of war; Henry feels guilty for running away as the battle began, but he just did what came natural. Stephan Crane wants to show the reader how bad war is, and the message comes across clear. The whole story is very well written and the reader has no problem understanding what is going on."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book is great!

After running from his first battle he eventually finds his regiment. While Henry is on his own trying to find his regiment, he is hit on the head with a gun. Henry lies to his regiment and tells them he was shot in the head. But after Henry lies a few times he starts to build courge.

It is a very interesting book and has an interesting plot and theme to go along with it. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This is war like you've never seen it before. In a time when war novels were being written with glorified battles and heroic deeds, when the Civil War had been romanticized to the point that the true effects of the war had been forgotten, and when war had once again come to be considered a noble art, this book came along and destroyed all of that. The book, of course, is set in the Civil War, and the hero is a young private eager to test his manhood in battle. The war itself, however, plays a very limited role in the action--though there is violence, and though the whole of the plot hinges on a battle in the war, it is not this which is important.The battle is not named. There is never any reference given to where it takes place geographically, and the book makes not one single mention of a real person or event in the Civil War. So why is this book heralded a classic Civil War novel? The answer lies in the fact that the conflict of the book (the real one) takes place entirely inside Henry's (the main character) head. Rather than focus on the violence, the bloodshed and carnage, the deeds of men in war, Crane chose to focus on the psychological effect of war, and at this he was very successful. The hero comes to be haunted--haunted by the memory that his acts of cowardice are never discovered and that his reputation is instead built on his public acts of bravery.This was one of the first novels to focus on the real side of war--the side without all the hype and glory. After WWI, this novel fit nicely as a sort of predecessor to modernist writing. This book is a great way to realize what war MIGHT really be like. Crane's genius lies in the fact that, at age 21, he could write such a novel about the horrors of war without ever setting foot on a battlefield (by that time, at least). The value of this novel is in the message about war, not in its portrayal of war itself, and for this the book is rightly considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"Ugh, I am still heaving up chunks of puke from reading this book.

Henry Fleming is lost in a world of monotony, where he lacks the signifigant challenge that would allow him to assume his role as a man. for that challenge he seeks out war, with the romantic notion of returning &quot;with his shield or on it&quot; in his head. When he finally encounters war, he discovers much to his discomfort that he might in fact be a coward. He continually tries to justify cowardice to fulfill an egotistical need to exert control in order to achieve manhood. Thus the symbolism of the false wound, ect.I disagree with a previous reviewer who points to Crane's verbosity and imagery with annoyance. This is not a realist's novel, and Crane was certainly no realist. The novel centers around Fleming's perception of the world around him and thus we read from an altered perception that cannot fully accept a world that he has no conscious control over. I think that it could be a fair reading that his acceptance of his own helplessness earns his true badge of courage and completes his passage to manhood."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This novel, though quite short, painted and incredibly dark and gripping picture of what the Civil War was like for those unfortunate souls who had to fight in it.

The book deals with the fears, sorrows, the cowardness and courage of the soldiers as they fought in one of the bloodiest wars-Chancellorsville. Although the author has not lived during the war, his writing portrays how the soldier felt in incredible accuracy. His book is written in great detail and lets the reader know how the soldiers felt. His writing is also very emotional at times when someone is lost during the battle.... Stephen Crane has very few weak points in his writing. In his writing, the quotes of the soldiers were kind of hard to understand. The reader needs to know a little about the southeastern accent before he or she reads it.When the soldiers have a conversation it can be quite dull. I would recommend this book to anyone older than 12 because of the violence and slang that he uses in the book. It is a great book for anyone that likes history with a little violence.I would also recommend this book to anyone that is interested in war or just wants to read a good fictional book based on the battle of Chancellorsville.BY seung kang"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I came away from this novel with disappointed expectations.

Usually in books authors focus on EVENTS, what happens around the central character; but in Red Badge, the author focused more on the soldier's thoughts as war, the &quot;blood swollen god,&quot; engulfed him, his friends, and his country. The &quot;youth&quot; soldier, the main character of the book, portrays in a sense what thoughts are at the essence of war: fear of death, fear of defeat, and fear of failure. This perception was highly usual for Crane's time, as authors before him portrayed war as a great and glorious and golden chance for victory. Crane, on the other hand, wrote with sarcasm and bitterness, with fear and vulnerability, shedding light on an entirely new view of war which fascinates the reader. He also wrote in changing &quot;moods&quot; or &quot;tones&quot;. One minute he'd be caught up in a whirlwind fury of sarcasm and humor; the next, in the blind blackness of fear; the next, in the desperation of a madman. Crane's changing tones are entirely interesting, as in his complex and beautifully visual metaphors and imagery. All of this shows war, battle, in its entirety, revealing to the reader the &quot;riot of emotions&quot; and the confusion that accompanies war and its dehumanizing factors. It's amazing to believe that Crane wrote this book in a little over a week, and at the time of his writing never experienced war. I recommend this to anyone wanting a deeper, more thoughtful reading experience."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephen Crane in 1987, depicts the life of Henry Fleming, a young Union soldier, in the Civil War. Henry Fleming, always referred as \\"the youth\\" by Stephen Crane, enlisted in the Union after hearing of daring battles and glorious victories, despite the discouragement from his mother. After he joins the army, his regiment doesn't see battle for months, and when the time comes to fight, a nagging thought enters the youth's mind, what if he runs when the real fighting begins? If he does run, he will be labeled a coward, but if he stays, he may be killed, the thought haunts him the rest of the story. As the battle begins, he stays and fights until he sees other soldiers start to flee, fear takes him and he runs with them. After the battle, he learns that his company held off the Confederates and Henry becomes afraid that if he returns, he will be labeled as a coward. He finally decides to go back to his regiment, so he travels along the wounded where he meets and witnesses the death of his friend, Jim Conklin. After the death, he is asked where he was hit, and without an answer, Henry backs off, soon realizing that he desired to wear a \\"Red Badge\\" or wound. This is a story that displays loyalty and courage.When the Union goes to war with the Confederates, the call goes out to the country. Will Henry Fleming be loyal to the country and serve in it? After much decision, he decides to fight in for the Union despite all of his mother's discouragement. He is also loyal to his comrades when he fought later in the book, because he stayed by their side and rallied his compatriots to keep fighting, even though many of them had died or ran. And with loyalty, Henry Fleming also had courage.When courage is needed, Henry overcomes the cowardice inside him. Henry had doubted himself before fighting the battle and actually ran off during the battle. When Henry finally becomes pooped out, he stops and regrets ever running away. He even heard that his regiment had held the Confederates off, which adds even more guilt on to him. He feels that he must proof himself, so he heads off to the sounds of battle, but gets lost on the way and ends up with the wounded where he witnesses his friend, Jim Conklin's, death. As he keeps walking, a wounded soldier comes by and asks Henry where he was injured. Henry, embarrassed, just walks away and then secretly desires a Red Badge, or wound, to show his courageous. Then, he gets in a tousle with another soldier and gets his head hammered open. When he reaches his regiment, his regiment recognizes the head wound as a \\"Red Badge\\" and pampers Henry, who enjoys the thought of heroism and goes along with the thought of being shot in the head. Later, a chance for Henry to redeem himself, he fires his gun in frenzy at the enemy so much, that his gun was burning his hands afterwards. Later, he picks up the Union flag from the dying flag carrier and swings it valiantly. Thus, overcoming his weakness of cowardice, and gaining the courage he needs.The book portrays a youth in the Civil War with setbacks to overcome flawlessly.

Thus, I embarked on page one with no previously conceived notion of the book's true worth to me.And, I loved it. Henry Fleming: greenhorn Yankee, afraid he might run, marches to his appointment with destiny. When faced with the terror of armed conflict, hand-to-hand butchery, a violent death, his fears materialize and he skedaddles. It is during this flight that Fleming's fortitude hardens. Stephen Crane artfully allows the reader to observe in detail a youthful mind steel itself to horror.Ultimately, Henry Fleming takes his place as a battle-hardened veteran, a hero, a man owning courage with which to regale the folks back home. It is this transition that Crane presents so exquisitely - from cowardice to courage, red badge and all.The Red Badge of Courage isn't a tome in size or in scope.

Crane using no names of the battle, landmarks, officers made the story timeless."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The Red Badge of Courage is unique. Like nothing before it, Crane created a new literary technique. This great work is usually treated as a &quot;young&quot; person's read but pity the &quot;old&quot; person who passes it by, thereby depriving themselves of a deeply effecting experience. Crane took the bold step of merging poetic verse into prose, of focusing the center of his story at the most mundane level of society, complete with the vulgar speech and overlaid a physical battle with a psychological one, all in one tightly constructed, compelling story, in just over a hundred pages. Incredible! The American critics at the time were not impressed, but reaction against ignorant criticism only served to validate Crane's innovative, superlative work. Crane is greatly over-looked today, misunderstood as writing in a crude, simplistic style - nothing could be further from the truth. Much of modern psychological, impressionistic literature can be traced back to Cran! e's The Red Badge of Courage. The art of Crane's story telling is also first-rate - it is hard to believe that he was never involved in a battle. He makes up for his lack of first-hand experience with his understanding of the basic reality, weaknesses and strengths, of the human experience - words such as heroes and cowards lose their everyday meanings in the fog of war. The &quot;youth's&quot; rite of passage to manhood on the field of battle is layered with meaning and symbolism - and ultimately each reader is left with their own personal experience, required to answer for themselves what transformation, what judgement, what change in character did or did not take place. Absolutely first rate literature. If you haven't read it, read it. If you read it in high school or college and think of it only as a simple story of young men in battle, read it again, and appreciate this work for the literary masterpiece that it is."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"That's what my classmates and I referred to it as while we were reading it in my eleventh grade English class.

It is definitely one of those books that made me smile...because it was over."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I read this book only recently. Many people could be lost in the simplistic setting and plot but if you look deeper you realize the true complexity of the novel.Crane uses this novel to ironically view the art of war. His vivid imagery and the actions of young Henry Fleming provide you with the progression of a soldier from an innocent to a seasoned warrior.Crane uses this book to make us view civilization as we know it. Are we really civilized? If so, why haven't we stopped practicing the primitive art known as war?"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I have read the &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; several times since I was 16, and have grown more fond of this piece each time I have read it. In many ways however, it does not capture the essence of Crane's vision into the psyche of the desperate human spirit. A far better and more representative piece of his incredible talent can be seen in his novella &quot;Maggie: A Girl of the Streets.&quot; For me, &quot;Maggie&quot; is a piece of literature second only to Victor Hugo's &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; Other great Crane stories include &quot;The Monster&quot; and &quot;The Open Boat.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"I thought this book was a very realistic view of war.

To be honest with you, I am not into war novels, and never held an interest in them, but this story was different. The description of the battles were outstanding, and it made me realize what war can do to a person's psyche, and that it isn' always &quot;glory.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"This book, like any has it's merits and faults. The naration is a bit unconventional in form, and the transitions are a bit confusing at times, and some imagery is strongly overused, but the intreaging character development and rich detailed descriptions make this book worth reading. It is true Crane never saw battle in his life, publishers have never made a secret of this, but after the book debued he was congradulated by war veterans for his accurate depictions and even consulted by various periodicals as a war coorespondant. If you are unconceded enough to get passed grammatical errors in the narration, and see the book for what it was when it was written, then you should enjoy it.

While trying to regroup with his regiment he witnesses the horrific death of one of his friends. Henry steps up in battle and is hit on the head. He gives his comrades the illusion that he was shot. In a later battle Henry has to be held down, to keep from firing. In the next battle Henry witnesses the Color Guard die. Henry picks up the and assumes the role of Color Guard.

This book was assigned reading for my English class. Crane is obviously a talented writer, and his ample writing skills bring color to the environment of this book, and his clever use of setting to convey the Youth's emotions is excellent and well implemented. It is one of the things that stood out to me while reading the book. Another is the rare use of proper nouns. Soldiers will be referred to by some characteristic or their rank, but rarely their name, e.g. \\"the young lieutenant,\\" \\"the tattered soldier,\\" etc. While this can make the story a bit harder to follow at certain junctures, it conveys how individuals are unimportant in war. The story itself is good: Henry \\"the Youth\\" (in more ways than one) has enlisted in the Union Army, and is torn between anxiety and nervousness about fighting. Although his first engagement seems to show that he will be alright, he runs, facing certain annhilation, at least in his perception. But his side turns out victorious, and Henry is in trouble. He eventually concocts a wild story and falls in with his comrades, on to fight again, to its final conclusion. This book is very slow reading, though it is small. It is difficult to read and digest. Crane's use of slang is certainly an artistic choice, and adds to authenticity but detracts from enjoyment as you need to analyze the context of misunderstood words. Throughout most of the book, Henry's arrogance is at a high level, and this is rather annoying as well. In conclusion, this book has a lot to say, but it is not light or easy reading. But if you can just get through it, it is one of the most honest and true war stories ever told."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"&quot; The red sun, pasted in the sky like a wafer&quot; The Red Badge of Courage continues to generate criticism on what war is all about. The Red Badge of Courage displays a view on what its like to go to war as a young boy. Henry decides to go off to war. Against his own mother's words. Henry thinks he can help with the war and become a hero. Henry gets a reality check as soon as he gets to the army. He is not as tough as he thinks he is. He starts to become very scared and sad. He now fears going into battle instead of wanting to challwenge his fighting skills he thinks he has. When Henry finally goes into battle, he is scared and wishes he never joined the army. He is seeing all his friends around him being killed and blood being shed. Henry becomes furious and scared and does not have a clue as to what's going on. He sees the enemy and all he can do is just fire his gun and run away, and hope everything is OK. After some time Henry starts to realize the meaning of life , and he starts to apperciate things much more. He realizes he can't run from everything. It was his choice to join the army. Henry starts to mature a little bit I think. As the war goes on. He starts to believe in himself and not worry about what others think. I think that this book is a good example of what a young boy acted like during this time period. As I continued to read on and come closer to the end, Things started to come together for Henry, As well as his regiment. Henry was not just some farm boy anymore, He was starting to become a man. I think that this book shows what going to war can do to anyones mind and body. As well has how they control there actions and the outcome of there actions."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"The basic plot of this story seems to be war. But as you delve deeper into the book you realize it's not just about war, it's about all the fears, hopes, and dreams of a boy caught up in a war. This boy, Henry Fleming, is a young Union army recruit who enters the war for the wrong reasons. He joins because of the glory and respect that comes with putting on that uniform. Eager to prove himself to the veterans and the other recruits, he begins to visualize what will happen during his first battle. He pictures many things, some of glory, some of failure, but the worst thing that he envisioned is him running from a battle. This is considered one of the most cowardly things that can be done. During his first battle, his worst dream comes true as he flees from the battle and gets separated from his regiment. As Henry finds himself lost in the nightmare of war he bumps into a hospital camp and talks to men who re-energize his confidence. He proves them right as he goes back to his regiment and earns his badge of honor by doing one of the most courageous acts of bravery that can be done. The formation of identity in this book is basically after Henry runs from the battle. He regains his confidence and composure and does what is right, proving his bravery with a true act of courage. How this is a formation of identity is that Henry basically starts out as a boy in the book, but ends as a man, making his mistakes seem so much less important than they really are. As you read you see his progression from the insecure boy to the courageous man he becomes. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The detail that Crane uses is exquisite and absolutely draws you farther into the book as you follow Henry Fleming on his way to becoming a man. I believe that this book is a must read for all juniors and seniors in high school."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"To me, The Red Badge of Courage is a masterpiece. It portrays the many hardships of war through the eyes of a young man. The young man, Henry Flemings, is wondering exactly what he will do in the heat of the battle. He struggles with himself and the enemy to find out what true courage is. Henry's first battle causes him to turn and run. He feels extreme guilt, as though he let his partners down. He returns to the battle with a newfound sense of courage. He has become a real man and also has learned what it means to have courage. The novel takes place in various battlegrounds and campgrounds. The states in which these settings took place are not exactly told. It was, however, in the 1800's and during the Civil War. Stephen Crane, the author of this great novel, uses flashbacks and symbolism to bring his work to a higher level of excellence. An example is when young Henry recalls his entering the war. He remembers his mom's tone, and the way she disagreed with his choice. Henry Flemings was filled with joy and pride entering the war. This novel depicts war life as it really is. Young Henry realizes that war is a hard life, and learns that courage is something that one digs deep down to find."},{"Title":"The Red Badge of Courage (Lake Illustrated Classics, Collection 1)","review":"To me, The Red Badge of Courage is a masterpiece.

I can relate to the fact that many of these are students that have been forced to read this book through no fault of their own. But this book is simply of the best physological profiles of a soldier in combat ever written. The fact that it is still read one hundred years after its intial publishing shows how excellent the writing is. The book follows the story of one man and his battles with his own fear in the face of enemy fire. The story is not really clear or defined, it is not meant to be. The story is at its heart about the confusion and fear on the battlefield, and how it tests a soldiers convitions, and personal integrity. The main character refers to most of the other characters in the novel using descptive names such as tall soldier, or the officer. This makes since, the main character is often wadering through a large army, and would not know the names of anyone but a few close compians in his own regiment.This is one of the only novels to ever truly come close to decribing the emotions that drive soldiers of victory or defeat on a battlefield.

The book was recommended to me by a family counselor. The only problem I had with the book was the authors' failure to acknowledge the glass ceiling that fathers still have with being involved with their children. The courts (at least in Washington County Minnesota) still regard the mother as the primary caretaker and influence in the childrens' lives. Although they don't always consciously acknowlege this, mothers often relegate the fathers to the status of being sperm banks and checkbooks. In this era of high seperation and divorce, many fathers see very little of their children and as a result, it is always the mother who has the greatest influence upon the childrens' lives and their view of men.

It was recommended to me by many friends, all of whom have been positively effected by the material."},{"Title":"The Law of One: Book II (Law of One) (Bk. 2)","review":"This is another channeling book. It is the second of four volumes. The entity being channeled is \\"Ra\\" of the sixth density of consciousness with the peoples of Earth being third density. Ra's intent is to communicate \\"THE LAW OF ONE\\" while not violating the distorted \\"Law of Confusion\\" or what we term free will. Because of Ra and his sixth density's associate's attempts to communicate their message of \\"The Law of One\\" as physical entities, the peoples of Egypt at that time distorted the message and considered Ra a God. I could find very little to disagree with in terms of any distorted messages being channeled thru Carla Ruechert. In fact the Ra Material seems to make the Edgar Cayce Material and the Seth Material appear distorted. Like the previous book the entire book is configured in a question/answer format. For a flavor of the book, below are excerpts in the form of a typical dialogue:\\"QUESTIONER: This motion picture (The Ninth Configuration) brought about the point about which we have been talking. The Colonel had to make a decision. I was wondering about his polarization. He could have knuckled under, you might say, to the negative forces, but he chose to defend his friend instead. Is it possible for you to estimate which is more positively polarizing: to defend the positively oriented entity, or allow suppression by the negatively oriented entities?\\"RA: I am Ra. This question takes in the scope of fourth-density as well as your own and its answer may best be seen by the action of the entity called Jehoshuah, which you call Jesus. This entity was to be defended by its friends. The entity reminded its friends to put away the sword. This entity then delivered itself to be put to the physical death. The impulse to protect the loved other-self is one which persists through the fourth-density, a density abounding in compassion. More than this we cannot and need not say.\\"Yet another important dialog as follows:\\"QUESTIONER: Would you define karma?\\"RA: I am Ra. Our understanding of karma is that which may be called inertia. Those actions which are put into motion will continue using the ways of balancing until such time as the controlling or higher principle which may liken unto your braking or stopping is invoked. This stoppage of the inertia of action may be called forgiveness. These two concepts are inseparable.\\"Then the dialog on birth defects as follows:\\"QUESTIONER: What part does what we call birth defects play in this process (process being pre-birth life selection).\\"RA: I am Ra. This is a portion of the programming of the mind/body/spirit complex totality manifested in the mind/body/spirit of third-density. These defects are planned as limitations which are part of the experience intended by the entity's totality complex (Higher Self). This includes genetic predispositions, as you may call them.\\"The question/answer dialog continues with fantastic information like:- Our planet started transitioning into the fourth density in the year 1926 and universally takes between 100 to 700 of our years to completely transition.- We choose our life experiences or lessons before birth. If we fail to learn them, they will rise again giving us the opportunity to learn it again and again until we choose correctly.- The evolution of the soul as explained by \\"Ra\\" matches the life between life research (using hypnotic regression) accomplished by Dr Michael Newton (his books are available on Amazon.com).- Black holes are the physical manifestations of \\"creations returning to the Creator\\".- The photon particle is the basic unit of consciousness that \\"we\\" are changing as we move from third density to fourth density. Those that cannot be harvested for fourth density will experience \\"discomfort\\" and cannot yet exist or tolerate the fourth density.- Anger is the cause of cancer. Anger being uncontrolled energy is the cause of rapid uncontrolled cell growth. Entities who choose the experience of anger have forgotten who God is.While the first book was easy to read and hard to put down; this one was more difficult to read yet strangely shorter (only 133 pages). I think what made this book more difficult is that the concepts were much more complex like covering the entity color crystallizations and the many combinations thereof. This forced me to stop reading and let the material sink into my consciousness.\\"I leave you in the love and the light of the One Infinite Creator.

Here the 'Free will' is of most importance, infringing on this wouldn't be according to the LoO.'Ra' sometimes addresses the relative unimportance of details regarding beings in our 'current reality', hoping that we are interested in(thus querying) details on the laws of Creation (and its ways).Then in the 1st session of book 2 the Questioner actually states:'This session I thought we could start Book Two of THE LAW OF ONE, which will focus on what we consider to be the only important aspect of our being..'Don't get me wrong.. Since the questioner is an ufologist he doesn't stop trying to comprehend the implications..These books really excel in their format!The question is asked, then 'Ra' provides an answer. Then if the answer istoo 'cryptic/difficult to comprehend' for him the questioner just acknowledges this and reformats the question. Perfect!But this isn't a book for newbe's, This serie of books(1 to 5) go all the way!As my English colleague(im Dutch) when he read the first book stated;\\"I've not started the other books yet, I planned to read the first one again, just to let things sink in.

She takes various monologues from students and staff attending Stuyvesant High School (located at ground zero) that witnessed September 11th first hand, all of which describe what the events of that day and the days to come were truly like, and tries to paint a picture of September 11th from a unique point of view. She attempts to manage the monologues in a way that reveals the ways in which people express themselves and does her best to make you truly listen to each individual's personal story.Annie Thoms is actually an English teacher at Stuyvesant High School, having received her MA in English Education from Teachers College, Columbia University. She is also an advisor for the school's Theater Community, and after looking through many monologues from both students and staff at the school Thoms selected ten and created and managed the play that was to be performed for the school's Winter Drama. This play later developed into the book \\"with their eyes\\".Thoms truly managed to achieve her goal with \\"with their eyes\\". Each monologue was vivid and descriptive, with every individual providing the reader with a unique perspective of the tragic events of September 11th. The book also does a great job of revealing the ways in which people express themselves, with each person's way of communicating being beautifully interpreted into their specific monologue. The order in which the monologues occur also successfully achieves Thoms's main goal by truly making you listen and think about what the speaker is telling you.Though the monologues do sometimes get slightly repetitive and boring and are probably much more interesting on stage, the book over-all provides wonderful insight and flows very nicely. With \\"with their eyes\\" Thoms truly provides a touching, creative story that will change your thoughts about the whole event."},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"I thought this was a spectacular book. I loved how each person a different view of what happened. Each person had different feelings and i like how they portrayed it in the book.

If you want to know the rest of the book, you have to read the book."},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"Never have I been prouder to be a graduate of Stuyvesant High School. On the morning of September 11th, when hijackers were flying the first plane into the WTC, I was shopping in the Cortlandt street Borders. I immediately left the store and sought comfort in my school, making it to the bridge just in time to see the second plane hook around and plow into the tower. I witnessed September 11th with the writers of the book; I was fortunate enough to work with Annie Thoms on my senior production of SING, months after the tragedy. While the stories are much more touching when heard in the people's own words...or at least performed on stage, as they were last year, the book touches you just the same. You don't have to know the ones telling their stories to feel what they did. The children are universal; their pain was all of New York's pain, was all of America's pain. And they have all prevailed since then, which gives the book such a happy ending. I am not a sappy person. I did not cry the day of the attacks. But I cried when I read this book. Even if only because it provides a sense of closure."},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"This book is amazing. Everyone living in New York on September 11th has their own 9/11 story. . .This book tells students and teachers from Stuy's stories about 9/11 and its aftermath. The book tells the untold stories of the students and teaches.. . .At first I though this book was just going to be 10 different accounts of planes hitting the WTC. . .but it is not that at all. Instead it is personal accouts of how 9/11 touched their lives. I recomend this book to everyone, especially people not from New York who want to comprehend how September 11th affected and changed lives"},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"This is not a broad-brush, wasn't-it-awful retelling. It's a very thoughtful, direct, personal contemplation of a very scary day and the weeks that followed. The characters' speeches in the book are the real words of people at the high school -- students and adults who worked there -- who have lives and personalties beyond 9/11. I felt they were all talking to me. The choice of voices and incidents is wonderfully diverse. I keep pushing this book on friends, and we always find different things to discuss.This one will keep you both riveted and thinking for a long time."},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"Although Annie Thomas is a brilliant writer, she did not write this book of monologues from Stuyvesant High school, a high school just a few blocks from ground zero. The book was first written as a play, each student that was cast for the play picked a student, or for that matter many students to interview. After taping the interviews the students worked for months to get them exactly right with each um like and not included. Annie and the students are trying to clue in the other 3 billion people in America, how traumatic that experience was, especially for people who were just a few blocks away.Thomas a high school English teacher had recently become faculty advisor for the high school's theater program. She wanted to find a unique play to do after September 11th. She give not only her recognition of the day's events, but includes many other teachers as well as students recollections as well.Although the book is an over all good piece of writing, it is very repetitive and hard to get through. Each student, though in their own words basically said the same things. All of the people in the United States understand how traumatic that day and reading the book just makes the reader relive the experience over and over again. The book as many good qualities, but just as many bad. The people that were interviewed are very diversified, you will read recollections from janitors and teachers as well as the students of the school. However, as stated before each student, teacher or janitor says the same thing even if it is in their own words. Since the book is meant to be performed as a play pictures of almost every person interviewed are included. This helps the reader visualize the play as if it were being formed in front of them. Even though it is repetitive With Their Eyes offers a different look at September 11th and how the people that were just blocks away on that faithful day dealt with an experience that hit literally so close to home."},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"This is absolutely the best book I have seen this year.

Stuyvesant high school is ranked number one in the country for a reason! These children, especially the ones who haven't been there for long, really got involved and brought out the best in this play which makes such a great book! I was fortunate enough to see this play both days and I was fortunate enough to witness a wonderful performance from all ten actors, and witness the producing and promotion talents of both producers, and a most special direction by both directors!

I realize I'm a little biased, but this book is absolutely amazing. A lot of the 9/11 accounts you hear are sappy and formulaic, people talking about how their lives will never be the same, blah blah blah. But these accounts are real and candid. The monologues cover the entire spectrum of Stuy students, faculty and staff. You experience the day and its effects from many perspectives. Though sometimes it reads a little slowly - there's a lot of \\"like\\" and \\"ummm\\" - you can almost forgive it because you realize that these are real people expressing their thoughts on a very intense day...and sometimes the words don't come so easily. I recommend it to everyone, in particular, adolescents, because they will have the easiest time relating to the stories of the students."},{"Title":"With Their Eyes September 11th: The View from a High School at Ground Zero","review":"I saw this play-before it was published-at Stuyvesant High School and it was powerfully directed and performed.

The message is strong, and the show focuses on my favorite aspect of acting, which is character development.

I can't say it helped much. Certainly, I became reasonably decent at sewing once my classes started, but I don't attribute any of my limited skill to this book. The best thing you can do for yourself is sit at a sewing machine with someone who has experience. Some of the information in this book is useful *after* you've learned the basics on a machine, but much of it is information useless to a person with no actual experience.

I was about to give up the teach-yourself-idea and enroll in some very expensive classes when I chanced upon this book. Amazingly by the time it took me to finish studying it (less than a month) I had not only learned to sew, but had also completed several Halloween costumes that earned the praise and admiration of friends and family.Written in the friendly Dummies style, illustrated with over 200 pictures, drawings, step-by-step diagrams, humorous icon guides and even hilarious cartoons, this book covers all the fundamentals of sewing from general information for beginners to tips and tricks for experienced sewers.Through simple, yet detailed, fully cross-referenced, clearly written explanations in plain English, and using proper, well-defined terminology, this reference contains all the basics. It includes assembling a sewing kit; selecting fabrics and threads; understanding and using patterns; working with hems, sleeves, pockets, collars, and closures; sewing for the home; and making repairs and alterations. It also offers some projects to test your acquired knowledge and progress, an appendix listing wonderful sewing resources in the US and on the Web, and a very thorough index for quick check-ups and specific consultations.Although the author could have been a bit more generous with the step-by-step diagrams, which are barely enough to get you through the instructions, and the projects could have been a bit more attractive, even if that meant sacrificing some of their simplicity, this fun to read, informative guide is still in my mind the best how-to reference available on the fundamentals of sewing, especially for those with no prior experience. The excellent instruction and practical tools and advice presented in this volume are well worth the price.Also recommended: The Complete Book of Sewing: A Practical Step-By-Step Guide to Every Technique by Chris Jefferys.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I received this book along with another, Simplicity's Simply the Best Sewing Book. As I began to work on my first project, I found myself turning more and more often to the Simplicity book. My pattern called for several techniques that were not described in Sewing for Dummies at all. For instance, the section on darts only covers one kind of dart. My pattern included a curved dart, but I didn't even realize it until I consulted the Simplicity book. Also, I needed to &quot;ease the hem.&quot; Sewing for Dummies does not describe what &quot;ease&quot; means, nore does it say how to do it or what the ease-stitch is.I'm glad I had the other book to compare it too, or I may have never realized how much information is missing from this one."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"If you are a true beginner, this book lacks sufficient pictures and diagrams.

This book runs the gamut from home decor, craft projects, and any type of clothing you'd ever want to wear."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"This book is just okay really. I knew absolutely nothing about sewing when I got this book. I wanted to start sewing clothing to sell, so I thought this would be a good place to start. It's not something you can sit down and just read at all. There's ALOT of information just sort of thrown together. It seems less like a how-to book and more like someone who knows alot about the subject just babbling at you. Honestly, I'd suggest 101 Essential Tips Basic Sewing. It gives you good basic advice in a quick simple manner. It's alot easier to follow. You dont have to skip from this section to this section to see what they're talking about, AND it's ALOT cheaper."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"If you have no prior experience with sewing, I do not recommend this book. There are no step by step photos or even illustrations for that matter, so reading through and trying to visualize what its talking about will most likely frustrate you to no end like it did with me at first. After trying to read this book a few times, I put it away to collect dust and chalked it up as a waste of money. I recently bought The Complete Book of Sewing by Chris Jefferys and remembered I had the Sewing For Dummies book so I dug it out with the intent to return it to the bookstore where I bought it. After looking through it a bit I (reluctantly) changed my mind about taking it back.After reading through the Complete Book of Sewing and also having successfully sewn a few things here and there, the For Dummies book makes a lot more sense now. There is some information in there that makes for good shortcuts and sometimes expounds upon certain topics the Complete Book of Sewing only went into at the most basic level. So the bottom line is: only after getting the Complete Book of Sewing and the Reader's Digest New Complete Guide to Sewing do I recommend the Sewing for Dummies book, but by then you may not need it anyway."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I usually LOVE the dummies series and find it very useful for new subjects I want to just dive into. This book is useful, but not as a first reference for someone who has never done more than the occasional needle-and-thread wobbly patching most of us did in College.The good:1. Very thorough subject coverage - everything from clothing to arts & crafts, to home decor (in fact, I think if they broke this up into two books - one for clothing only, and one for the rest, they would have done themselves a big favor).2. The step descriptions are broken down into mini-steps very well (I think).The bad:1. hardly any illustrations at all. Where there are illustrations, they are very basic, mostly restricted to the type of stitch described rather than an illustration of the step-by-step process.2. the level of terminology-knowledge assumed by the book is insanely high for beginners.3. There is insufficient internal cross referencing - the writers seem to assume you will read the book from cover to cover in the right order, and that you will remember everything you learned from one chapter to the next.4. The section on \\"Quick fixes and alterations\\" which is boasted about in the book description is far from comprehensive, and the steps described are skimpy - largely without internal references to where within the book these steps are described.This will be a great 2nd book, I think.

It would have been so easy to add an additional step, or make clear whether the right side or the wrong side is showing in the drawing, or a simple photograph of a finished product, and it just doesn't.The best I can say for it is that it gave me enough information on any particular topic to look it up on the internet and get useful help."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I've been teaching myself to sew the last few months and in that time I've checked out all the books my library has to offer on the subject.

It's not a bad book but there are better books out there for those of us who are new to sewing or need a refresher in basics. If the book were organized differently I think I might like it more. Compared to other books of this type the information is not as well organized or easy to find. The illustrations are nice but again I've seen others that work better for me.
