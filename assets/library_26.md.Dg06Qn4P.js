While searching in the field where the bomber crashed, with the owner's permission, I was asked by the owner to visit his house. While there, he and his wife gave me the only identifiable, large pieces of the crashed bomber I had seen.After a month and half, I was able to prove they came from a B-24 and not a B-17. Though all U.S. records, stated no B-24 had crashed in France on the 9/10th of November, 1944.It took another month to prove all U.S. records wrong and based upon K.I.A. records, I was able to prove it was a B-24 that crashed at Tincourt-Boucly and not a B-17.First, I had to prove myself wrong and than I proved myself right. Everything in the first book is right, it just involves two different aircraft, thanks to to an 8th U.S.A.A.F. cover up of a Secret Bomber.All people who has purchased \\"Book One\\" of the two combined books to be, will have the opportunity to upgade to the new book when it is finished.In May, 2000, we found final and undeniable proof of the real crashsite of the B-17. It is written about in the first book, but was overlooked in 1994, due to a local author telling us of a crash date two weeks later. This, we later found was to protect a book he was writing for distribution in France.After a year, we are still waiting for the United States Mememorial Affairs-Washinton to follow U.S. Law and Regulations and conduct a full Search and Recover Mission at the actual crash site.This site was proven by the finding of the missing Identity Tag of 1st Lt.

The Book resolves around a legend of a grave located in Cartigny, France with a stone cross headstone that reads 'American Aviator-Unknown-23 November 1944'(in French)Normaly all American remains of WWII are buried in a Americain Cemetery overseas or sent home at next of kin request. Mr Cole based the book kinda like a autobiography during his research. He is a WWI enthusiest who stubbled apon this grave in Cartingy, France and became determand to find out whose remains are in this grave. His research leads him to many people and to many places in the United States and France. He finds a secret that has been kept for 50 years which involves two Medal of Honor winners. The grave holds the remains of four Airmen of the B-17 Bomber 'The Lady Jeannette' Today Mr Cole had placed a Monument at the grave identifing these 4 men who died for their country in a horrible way and at the crash site. These four men also have offical graves in the states and at an American Cemetery in France which gives the book a good twist of reading. The book is almost set up like a mystery which does keep you interested even while he goes thru his routine of visiting WWI places and giving a book tour of the WWI battlefield areas. This could get boring if you are not a history buff or a military history buff at that. The book is good reading for both WWII and WWI buffs."},{"Title":"Tryin' Hard to Mellow Out","review":"This book is a real find: warm, witty and wise, it has something for everyone.

Foster, Educating Congregations: The future of Christian Education, Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1994. 160 pages. ISBN 0-687-00245-1Reviewed by Ted WithamEducating Congregations is a hopeful voice for a Church that could easily lose its way in the \\"pluralistic and technological global village\\". (p. 11) It begins by acknowledging that the cup which used to hold the future of the Church is cracked. Foster argues that church education needs to be corporate, because it is only in community that we can nurture Christian faith, identity and vocation. He advocates an \\"incarnate\\" style of education.I found helpful Professor Foster's analysis of contemporary flaws in Christian education.1. We do seem to have lost our corporate memory, and are increasingly paralysed in our attempts to make connections with the next generation. We share too tiny a story of background with young people for them to explore with us.2. Our Bible teaching does seem irrelevant, in the sense that many people have been part of our churches and their educational programmes for decades and yet they have not had their real questions answered.3. Our Christian education goals do seem to have been subverted for therapeutic or even marketing purposes. The most severe implication of this is that Christian education has come to mean providing \\"programmes\\" for the children and a narrow group of adult \\"learners\\", rather than fostering the growth of all the congregation in the love and knowledge of God.4. It does appear that the Church continues to be held in \\"cultural captivity\\", subtly endorsing conventional secular values or political correctness, unable to make a Gospel critique of the culture.5. And in the past few years, we do seem to have seen the church's educational strategy collapse. Times have changed: computers and television have brought about systemic changes in our lives; in al denominations, the central support of congregations for Christian formation has been drastically curtailed, and market for! ces drive curriculum choices and changes.Into this challenging scenario, Charles Foster brings hope. Education, he says, consists in preparation for events, engagement in them, and critical reflection on them. He discerns different kinds of events in a congregation's life suitable for this \\"event-full\\" education. He names them paradigmatic (those that pattern the basis of our common life), seasonal, and occasional.Foster makes an attractive case that if a congregation attends seriously to the normal events in its life, it will be engaged in effective education of its members. It may well choose to continue to use existing programmes and processes, like EFM or set Sunday School syllabuses, but not as an end in themselves.Foster cites a church in which the members prepare for the seasons by extensive study of pertinent biblical texts and the traditions. This exhaustive process lasts months. This strategy can help a congregation build community, make meaning, and nurture its hope for its future.As I read this reader-friendly book, my hope was nurtured too. The US context translates only too readily into our own, and both the analysis presented and the strategies suggested are easy to appreciate and follow.My fear is that the title, Educating Congregations will put people off a resource that will have broad value in supporting the whole ministry of a congregation. This is one of a series of recent books which put education back into its proper rle, as an enabler of the total life of a congregation."},{"Title":"Educating Congregations: The Future of Christian Education","review":"We used Charles Fosters' book in our Christian education class at my seminary. At the heart of this book is an extended project of congregational analysis, designed to be done by an individual or by a group to assess the way things are currently done in one's congregation or educational setting, and calling upon the reader to reflect on how things should be based upon real, factual observations of the situation.Foster looks at education in congregations on both a theoretical and a practical format. His first chapter looks the flaws he has identified in church education - lack of known history (corporate memory), irrelevance of teaching from the Bible (echoes of Barthian critiques here), a shift (Foster's word is 'subversion') from educational goals to pastoral/psychological/therapeutic models, an enshrinement of the status quo, and the lack of cohesive, comprehensive strategy in education.In the American religious history, a transition has taken place whereby it was once true that the majority of congregation members would know the Bible and something of their denominational/communal history from sources outside the church (family, school, etc.), but that this is no longer true. Foster looks at ways to build greater participation and community in the educational offerings of the church, which must mean more than one hour per week on Sunday mornings. Building relationships, making meaning from shared stories and texts, and looking past the malaise and despair that takes hold of some congregations (as they become embattled and reactive to events outside the church in the world, and sometimes to events inside the church.Educating Congregations is a book that should be read by everyone in the congregation, not just the pastor or the Sunday school coordinator. One of the Foster's primary issues, running through the whole text in different ways, is that the education of the congregation is the responsibility of the entire congregation, and each member has a role in this. Education is not something simply 'done' to the members of the congregation, but rather education should be active engagement between all the people, all bringing their gifts as individuals to fit into a comprehensive vision of community.It is a tall order, but one that is achievable. Foster's text is very accessible and interesting, complete with academic grounding and full of personal stories and examples that make the principles come alive for the reader."},{"Title":"Look at My Ugly Face!: Myths Musings Beauty Other Perilous Obsessions w/ Women's Appearance","review":"I was very impressed with Halprin's ability to weave her own story into this profound treatise on the effects of physical appearance on our relationships and spiritual life.

The author does indeed debunk some of the mythic events of our revolutionary past. However, his purpose is NOT to prove that the founders were somehow evil, or to argue that the US is not a great nation, or to make young Americans cynical, or even to show off by attacking other historians.Rather, he's arguing that the founding myths-- the amazing (and often fictional) achievements of people like Paul Revere, Molly Pitcher, Patrick Henry, etc.-- obscure an important reality: The American Revolution was one of the broadest-based political movements in human history, and all of the patriots who participated deserve credit, not just the \\"heroes.\\"Why does this matter at all? Because the genius of the American idea is that we are both a nation of \\"the people\\" and a nation of individuals. Focusing on individual accomplishments obscures the truly amazing nature of the accomplishments of the founding generation as a collective whole.Further, some of the myths Raphael debunks actually distort our history in important ways. For example, the myth that the Revolution essentially ended with the British surrender at Yorktown denies the important reality that the fighting continued for more than a year afterward, and the outcome was very much in doubt for that whole time. The myth that all of the fighting in the Revolution was British vs. American patriots ignores the reality that in the southern colonies, the Revolution was a vicious civil war between American loyalists and American patriots, a struggle that was to have consequences for the next hundred years.Those who see this book as the explication of some sort of egalitarian bias are welcome to their views. However, the simple fact is that Raphael is correct. All of his analyses and assertions are supported by ample documentation, and I'd be interested in seeing the sources that the reviewers who are attacking him are relying on.This book is well worth reading and thinking about. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"This book is subtitled \\"Stories That Hide our Patriotic Past\\", which is an important theme of the book. The author contends that the myths that have been created about the Revolutionary War and its heroes obscure the real story and overshadow the important contributions of countless unsung patriots. Unfortunately, some chapters do degenerate into a populist, left leaning, screed that has prompted some reviewers to trash this book. However, on balance, I found the information provided far outweighed the chapters that degenerated into a screed. The author is careful to document when and why these myths were created and how they have been incorporated into textbooks and how this incorporation has changed over time. I found this documentation to be very important, since without it the author might just be substituting one myth for another.Some of the myths are well known to be myths, with little or no historical foundation. The story of Molly Pitcher and that of young George Washington chopping down the cherry tree fall into this category. Other stories are not myths ser se, but rather are simplifications that distort the actual historical fact. The idea that the Revolutionary War ended with the victory at Yorktown is an example of this type of \\"myth\\". Fighting continued after this battle, and ten times more American soldiers died after Yorktown than died in the battle itself. A good history points out that the peace treaty was not arrived at until September of 1783, 25 months after the victory at Yorktown, but the fighting during these 25 months (a civil war in the Southern Colonies/States between Patriots and American Loyalists) is often overlooked. The civil war aspects of the war are often replaced by the myth of solidarity of the colonists against Britain. The book also discusses, in some detail, the world-wide character of the war and that in many respects the fighting in India and a possible invasion of Britain by France and Holland was much more important than the war in America.The author tries to dispel the myth that Samuel Adams single handedly directed the people of Massachusetts to rebel. His theses is not only that is this not the case, but it obscures the fact that in 1774, in response to the Massachusetts Government act (which deprived the locally elected governments of most of their powers and prevented people from gathering in town meetings without the approval of British appointees)thousands of farmers and tradesmen, independent of Adams, moved to oust these British appointees. Not only did Adams not direct these actions, he disapproved of them. Thus, the myth of the importance of one man obscured the much more important actions of thousands. The author also tackles the idea that Jefferson single-handedly created the idea of Independence. There is a side-by-side comparison of George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Declaration of Independence, showing that Jefferson just put Mason's ideas in a much more poetic format. Furthermore, many of the delegates came to Philadelphia with instructions to vote for independence and did not need Jefferson's prodding to do so. Also, the idea of July 4th being the important (mythic) date is shown to be somewhat of a simplification. The important thing was the ratification of the declaration by the individual colonies, which was not completed for 19 more days. The bulk of the signings by individuals did not occur until August (and in a few cases much later) and that some of these signers were not even at the convention. Again the point is not that July 4th is not important, but the choosing of a somewhat arbitrary date makes the history easier to tell, but obscures the fact that it was the individual colonial legislatures that declared independence, not just a group of 56 signers.Some the most controversial aspects of the book are the chapters discussing the participation of Indians and slaves in the war and how they faired after the war was over. These chapters are important, but offend many because of what is easily perceived as a left-wing anti-US bias. While I agreed with some of what the author was trying to say, I felt that he was guilty of some of the same simplifications that he rails against.I would recommend this book to those who are interested in a more nuanced presentation of the Revolutionary War and those who have been designated as its heroes. For some, however, pointing out that some of their most cherished ideas are little more than myths will be unsettling."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"Often it takes time for history to prevail over mythology, but it can happen, as this author proves. The book is well documented, and the references check out. The one-star reviews speak for themselves - neither really addresses any of the issues raised in any substantive manner.Yes, Americans have generated their own mythology surrounding what Americans consider to be key events or key instruction points in their history. No surprise there - every nation does that. (The Serbs still celebrate a massive defeat on the plains of Kosovo in 1389, almost 620 years ago!)The author's point is that the truth actually reveals more about what is most laudable in the American character than do the myths. He argues quite convincingly that the truth is both more interesting and more worthy of remembrance than are the myths. His arguments are thoroughly footnoted and his sources are well documented.I will not spoil the book for those who have not yet read it, but I do highly recommend it to any and all who are more interested in truth than in mythology."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"It is quite unsettling when the historical \\"truths\\" we believe to be absolute turn out to be embellishments, myths, or outright fabrications. We believe the Revolutionary War and the Founding Fathers to be sacred; they are beyond reproach. The truth is tough to take, but as Ray Raphael explains in great detail, the embellishment of any individual act of heroism during the Founding period of our nation cannot detract from the hundreds or thousands of acts of heroism that went on daily but just didn't make it into the history books. Often, the embellishments or myths that have evolved around a particularly famous event actually serve to portray that event as less exceptional than it really was. Many episodes from the Founding have been mythologized not from a desire to cover up the truth, but to convert what was a complex struggle into streamlined stories that could be passed down to children. This is why we must always be skeptical of oral traditions that are assumed to be fact: They are going to have been embellished; it is impossible for them not to have been. They may tell a great story or pass on an important moral, but allowing them to become dogma only conceals the truth.Despite its flippant cover, Founding Myths is not light reading. Raphael does examine a few of the more recognized Founding stories, but he writes as if he is on a crusade, and before long he is delving deeply into the characters and motivations of the Founding Fathers themselves. He cites his sources, and I am sure he has done his research, but his interpretations are completely egalitarian: There seems to be no room in his worldview for individual impetus or catalysis. If any individual Founder acted in a particularly prescient or heroic way, he could only have done so because his constituents ordered him to. The Patriots rose up as one, in other words, the Founding Fathers were simply pushed to the front to do the bidding of the masses. Well, sure, sometimes, but our Revolution didn't go the way of the French Revolution, and the Founding Fathers are the reason.This is an important book for those studying American history, but be prepared for some rambling and some egalitarian bias."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"As with many books that challenge peoples closely held beliefs, Ray Raphael's Founding Myths is sure to stimulate love and hate. As for myself, having been a student of American history for 40 years, I found this book fascinating, well researched, well written and entertaining.As a conservative and unbiased reader, the book appears to me to be a straight forward telling of the truth, substantiated by meticulously researched documentation.The plain and simple fact, (one that Mr. Raphael has covered in prior books), is that the American Revolution was truly a revolution of the people. Our children need to learn this fact before they can truly appreciate the foundations of our current state. Certainly they cannot be harmed knowing the truth. Even more certainly, they can only benefit from learning that history is not simple and that it is not made up solely of the actions of a few, regardless of how significant the contributions of the few may be. Mr. Raphael does not discount or diminish the character or contributions of our \\"founding fathers\\" but he does shine a long neglected light on the many thousands of individuals and individual acts by \\"common\\" people that brought about the United States.I believe this book will serve as a wonderful adjunct to the teaching of American history in schools, particularly elementary education. The rote, misleading and often just plain wrong history being promulgated throughout our nation's schools is not doing our children any service but instilling in them the twin concepts of hero worship and blind faith in myths and fairy tales. This book will help them learn to look at history and the world they live in with a more critical and less nave eye."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"Why oh why don't historians trust their materials to make their point? In concept, this is an outstanding book -- take a look at the difference between the way we perceive our founding period, and the way the historical record actually shows it was, with detailed references as to how each legend became romanticised in the 19th century. The core of this book is oustanding. The detailed analysis is informative, and it points out some key errors in major recent historians (e.g. McCullough's book on John Adams).The problem is that the author has to CONSTANTLY editorialize about how anti-Democratic and corrupting these changes are. It gets pedantic FAST, and insults the reader's intelligence by telling him/her dogmatically how to read both the original material and the current text. What this does it both politicize the analysis unnecessarily and weaken the argument. It also annoys the reader with redundancy.It is a common sin of politically-motivated historians to beat their arguments to death to make a point; this history is a left-leaning one, but right-leaning ones also have the same flaw. This approach badly weakens the texts in question, and insults the reader's intelligence. The constant editorializing turns what would have been an excellent history into something only suitable for the contemporary political \\"echo chamber,\\" where every political persuasion has its own set of facts and assumptions.And that's too bad, because this book could have and should have transcended that morass."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"I really like reading about the founding fathers and colonial/revolutionary history. After reading this and Raphael's other two Revolutionary era books, however, I don't think I will see things in the same way.The fact is that many of the \\"revolutionary ideas\\" the founding fathers espoused had been around for years and were not that revolutionary after all (except for some of their ideas on religion, to which some were either indifferent or openly hostile); Massachusetts was basically an independent state before the Declaration of Independence without the help or assistance of the founding fathers; and that the people, not a group of 8 or so rich guys, played a much more important role in America's independence (in fact, like today, the rich didn't even fight - they bought their way out).The main point of this book is that our current views of history allow us to disregard the contributions of the many, who bear the most costs, to the benefit of the few, who bear little if any cost (I doubt any of the soldiers fighting in today's wars will see any oil money, while the president and his friends, who have never fought in any wars, will benefit handsomly).The fact that people, not the rich, were the main drivers behind the revolution is a revolutionary idea. What could be more patriotic than that?"},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"History is an interesting journey. From the actual events, to it's gradual interpretation and re-interpretation based on its impact, it's true that many things become twisted, distorted, and down right wrong. People say that hindsight is 20/20, but it's clear, that after many years, that 20/20 becomes 20/200, and we see the things that we choose to see, and believe the things that make good stories. Such is the premise of Ray Raphael's book, \\"Founding Myths\\".Raphael's basic premise is that many of the stories that we are taught and choose to believe are actually historical fabrications, many of them designed to help teach a rather complex subject in school and to build the mass sense of patriotism that often grips our country. Two such stories, Paul Revere and Molly Pitcher, end up being mostly figments of a good writer's imagination, and both blown way out of proportion. Sam Adams contrbiution to the Revolution as a hot-headed revolutionary was actually a British invention designed to make the revolutionary fervor sweeping the colonies seem containable. Raphael's book promotes the concept that by highlighting the actions of a few people, we diminish or dismiss the actions of \\"the people\\", who were more involved in the revolution than previously thought.Raphael's examination of why such things happen is very intriguing; why these tales developed over time and why, the stories we may have heard growing up, have become fictional cornerstones in the path of our history. Much of it seems like a complex, written form of the game of Telephone, where one author's embellishment leads down a path of error that soon becomes impossible to correct. One person said it, or wrote it, so it must be true.This leads to another thought: is historical accuracy of prime importance to the masses? Raphael writes of its importance, in order to shed new light on the event. Pulling away from the Revolutionary Faces that we all know and love, and putting it's focus on those people in the colonies that truly drove the fervor. I've often thought that my own journey into my love of history began with those people, the Washington, and more importantly, Thomas Jefferson, as a way into the melee and drama. Such large scale events may be hard to understand initially, so may be we seek the views of people who lived through it as a path into the event. That is another point to decide.The one downfall of Raphael's book is that he spends some time discrediting other writers of the Revolutionary Generation, including two of my favorites: David McCullough and Joseph Ellis. I find it poor sport that an author would try to prove his point by making targets out of other's work. Instead of having the intended of effect of strengthening his argument, it just makes me suspect as to why he would spend pages attacking these authors. It pulled me out of the book for a bit.This book, if anything, is a wonderful exmaination of a time in our country's history frought with much myth and story. I love looking at events long since learned in a new light. The book is not weighted down with much historical minutae (which sometimes happens with historical non-fiction) but is a pleasant, well-written examination of the times. Whether or not you believe Raphael is besides the point. These things should be viewed again, debated, talked about, and pondered, for it brings to life these times, and makes history the exciting subject it should always be."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"Please Note - When this review was originally written the hardback and the paperback reviews were not linked together and two reviews were treated separately. However, they are now linked and both appear here.This book is subtitled \\"Stories That Hide our Patriotic Past\\", which is an important theme of the book. The author contends that the myths that have been created about the Revolutionary War and its heroes obscure the real story and overshadow the important contributions of countless unsung patriots. Unfortunately, some chapters do degenerate into a populist, left leaning, screed that has prompted some reviewers to trash this book. However, on balance, I found the information provided far outweighed the chapters that degenerated into a screed. The author is careful to document when and why these myths were created and how they have been incorporated into textbooks and how this incorporation has changed over time. I found this documentation to be very important, since without it the author might just be substituting one myth for another.Some of the myths are well known to be myths, with little or no historical foundation. The story of Molly Pitcher and that of young George Washington chopping down the cherry tree fall into this category. Other stories are not myths ser se, but rather are simplifications that distort the actual historical fact. The idea that the Revolutionary War ended with the victory at Yorktown is an example of this type of \\"myth\\". Fighting continued after this battle, and ten times more American soldiers died after Yorktown than died in the battle itself. A good history points out that the peace treaty was not arrived at until September of 1783, 25 months after the victory at Yorktown, but the fighting during these 25 months (a civil war in the Southern Colonies/States between Patriots and American Loyalists) is often overlooked. The civil war aspects of the war are often replaced by the myth of solidarity of the colonists against Britain. The book also discusses, in some detail, the world-wide character of the war and that in many respects the fighting in India and a possible invasion of Britain by France and Holland was much more important than the war in America.The author tries to dispel the myth that Samuel Adams single handedly directed the people of Massachusetts to rebel. His theses is not only that is this not the case, but it obscures the fact that in 1774, in response to the Massachusetts Government act (which deprived the locally elected governments of most of their powers and prevented people from gathering in town meetings without the approval of British appointees)thousands of farmers and tradesmen, independent of Adams, moved to oust these British appointees. Not only did Adams not direct these actions, he disapproved of them. Thus, the myth of the importance of one man obscured the much more important actions of thousands. The author also tackles the idea that Jefferson single-handedly created the idea of Independence. There is a side-by-side comparison of George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Declaration of Independence, showing that Jefferson just put Mason's ideas in a much more poetic format. Furthermore, many of the delegates came to Philadelphia with instructions to vote for independence and did not need Jefferson's prodding to do so. Also, the idea of July 4th being the important (mythic) date is shown to be somewhat of a simplification. The important thing was the ratification of the declaration by the individual colonies, which was not completed for 19 more days. The bulk of the signings by individuals did not occur until August (and in a few cases much later) and that some of these signers were not even at the convention. Again the point is not that July 4th is not important, but the choosing of a somewhat arbitrary date makes the history easier to tell, but obscures the fact that it was the individual colonial legislatures that declared independence, not just a group of 56 signers.Some the most controversial aspects of the book are the chapters discussing the participation of Indians and slaves in the war and how they faired after the war was over. These chapters are important, but offend many because of what is easily perceived as a left-wing anti-US bias. While I agreed with some of what the author was trying to say, I felt that he was guilty of some of the same simplifications that he rails against.I would recommend this book to those who are interested in a more nuanced presentation of the Revolutionary War and those who have been designated as its heroes. For some, however, pointing out that some of their most cherished ideas are little more that myths will be unsetting.Please note - The paperback edition of this book is published by New Press, and Amazon lists it as being 368 pages long versus a length of 352 pages for this edition. To confuse things a bit more, Amazon lists this edition as being only 331 pages long, which is incorrect."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"This is not so much the debunking of myths, but the debunking of the current dumbed-down version of history as taught by our contemporary school system. A serious student of history will not learn much, but perhaps it may serve to open some oportunities for the reader to do further study and to pursue a more in depth knowledge of history."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was most informative, well documented and written with care. Most books on the American Revolution will begin somewhere in 1755 with the French and Indian War and end with Washington's innaugeration. This is simply too much material, none of which can be covered in any depth and the back stories are non existent. In this book we begin with Paul Revere's ride and continue with Lexington and Concord, Valley Forge, Morristown, the Declaration of Independence, and the stories behind the story are well documented and very enlightening. There is so much that led up to the major events in the revolutionary war. And yet most authors can't deal with these \\"lead-ups\\" due to material and page restrictions. Without these back stories and leadups to the major events, many turning points in the revolution would have never taken place. The author writes so well. His story flows easily and keeps the reader's interest. You aren't mentally tired or exhausted when you finish the last page. You are disappointed that the story has ended and very much enlightened. So don't miss out on this wonderful story of the revolution. It is a pleasure to navigate the pages. And if you want to be considered an informed student of the American Revolution, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"The book is NOT espousing some grand \\"liberal\\" conspiracy to denigrate or change our history; as some reviewers seem to believe. Instead, it is simply stating easily proven facts regarding mythologized characters and events in our nation's Revolutionary era. It can be dry in some areas, but overall it's a decent piece of work.I know some reviewers on here have stated dismay or disappointment over Raphael's exposing of the truth. I guess those people would believe that ignorance is bliss and probably still want to believe that the Tonkin Gulf Incident occurred just as the LBJ Administration claimed it did back in the 60's. Enjoy a life of being taken advantage of, over and over again.It stands to reason that some of these iconic figures in our history should be the ones trumpeted throughout our history. Doesn't it? Historical icons like Franklin (And don't get me wrong, I dig Ben Franks!), Jefferson and Revere had so much more access to the mass public than would a very young, little known doctor (Prescott) and a tanner (Dawes). Revere had his own small engraving/pressing business. Who do you think had more ability to get their version of the events out more easily and widely, a commoner standing around trying to tell any passerby from a street corner, or a guy who has a media outlet at his disposal? It's common sense and it happened all the time. If you study any history from the era, and later, one thing you'll see over and over again is that many of the military leaders \\"led\\" troops from the rear echelon. However, after the battle ended in victory, most of the time those \\"commanders\\" would get the accolades and a raise in their rank. Does that mean that they did all the important fighting while the common foot soldier who, in reality, slugged it out in the trenches, sat idly by? Far from it, but due to the elavated status in society, the commander got the credit, not the lowly foot soldier who bled and died. Those in power, were/are great at self-aggrandizement. Maybe most humans are. I'm sure lower ranked people are self-aggrandizers too. The difference is, the powerful have the ability to get their version of the events out to the masses, whereas the common man does not. That is how the facts get/got lost. I think that might be the point I took from Raphael's book. For a few examples of the way this works, look at Richard Henry Lee, Friedrich Engels or Alfred Dreyfus; just to name a few. That is not revisionist history, that is fact.As for those who claim these are well known \\"strawmen\\", I've taught APUSH for over a decade, and I can tell you, the real facts are not well known among the youth, or many in the public. Ask any high school/college class who made the Midnight Ride and 90% + will answer \\"Revere\\", without hesitation. Ask most people on the street and you will overwhelmingly get the same response. Then ask them what was the final battle of the Revolution? If they can even remember that much, they will almost always answer \\"Yorktown\\", completely disregarding the last year and a half of combat operations in the south. This would be like claiming the European Theater of war, in WWII, ended after the Battle of the Bulge or Stalingrad. I think that false view disregards all the sacrifice and valor made by both sides after The Bulge and Stalingrad.Anyway, if you spend your time living in reality, and like to know the truth about your own nation's history, I think you'll find this book to your liking. If that isn't the way you like your history, factual, then say \\"Hello\\" to the Tooth-Fairy and Easter Bunny for me."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"Very good and quick transaction. Book arrived promptly in the condition advertised. The last half of the book itself was a little too much like a text book for my liking."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"Mr. Raphael has obviously done his research, and the factual information presented in \\"Founding Myths\\" is interesting enough in its own right to have saved this from a one-star rating. From the first pages of the introduction, however, it was obvious that Mr. Raphael had an axe to grind. At first, I thought he might simply be another America-hating revisionist history writer, but that didn't quite fit. After a few chapters, it finally began to gel: he seems quite bitter that his work has not proved as popular as other historians and writers.For example, in the first chapter, he rails for page after page about the historical inaccuracies of Longfellow's poem about Paul Revere's Ride. While his points are well-taken, the bitterness in which they are presented is simply not warranted. Longfellow, after all, was writing a poem; a poem based on historical events and meant to entertain and inspire, but like any work of fiction, presumably never intended to be viewed as 100% historically accurate. Is it pathetic that future educators have proven so lazy as to use the poem as historical fact rather than historical fiction? Certainly it is, but that's hardly Longfellow's fault. Mr. Raphael writes this chapter as if Longfellow had some sinister ulterior motive to deceive generations of school children.Similarly, in his chapter about Patriotic Slaves, Mr. Raphael blathers on for several pages about the gross historical inaccuracies of the Hollywood film, \\"The Patriot.\\" Honestly, how old must one be to realize that Hollywood rarely, if ever, produces a film of historical accuracy? The film was meant to be entertainment, not education. The fact that Mr. Raphael's bitterness has caused him to completely lose perspective is demonstrated later in this same chapter, when he contrasts the quantity of slaves freed by the Underground Railroad, preceding the Civil War, with the vastly larger quantity who gained freedom by fleeing to the British during the Revolution. His valid point loses all impact with the statement, \\"the Underground Railroad features racist Southerners like Simon Legree as antagonists...\\" Simon Legree? Really? Mr. Raphael, assuming no one else has done so, allow me to point out that Simon Legree is a fictional character, one invented by Harriet Beecher Stowe in her fictional book about slavery in America, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" For someone who spends a sizable portion of his book lambasting writers of fiction for historical inaccuracies in their work, it seems rather disingenuous to then link the fictional character of Simon Legree to the factual accomplishments of the Underground Railroad in an attempt to demonstrate a point of historical accuracy.In short, it appears that Mr. Raphael's professional beef, as it regards history, is with those who treat works of historical fiction as if they were factually accurate. This is quite legitimate, particularly when those doing so are other historians or educators, as this does a disservice to those students misinformed by such sloth. But the fact that Mr. Raphael continually and vehemently attacks the writers of historical fiction as if they are somehow to blame for the laziness of others who treat their fiction as an educational tool belies his personal beef: Mr. Raphael is apparently bitter and jealous that these writers have proven more popular than him. After all, Longfellow is a household name; Raphael is not. Similarly, the majority of Americans have likely heard of the film, \\"The Patriot,\\" but I'm sure the same cannot be said of any of Mr. Raphael's historical works. Unfortunately, this personal beef so embitters Mr. Raphael as to color, and in several places completely overshadow, his more significant professional beef.If you want an entertaining book about historical inaccuracies, check out \\"Lies My Teacher Told Me.\\"Lies My Teacher Told Me (Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong)While it doesn't focus exclusively on the American Revolution, it's along the same lines of historical inaccuracies repeated ad nauseum by educators... but without the bitterness of a personal axe to grind."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"The author dislikes heroes, indeed, all heroic individual effort. For Raphael, heroism leads to hero-worship, which in turn can be used as propaganda and lead to militarism and ethnocentrism. True enough, but heroic individuals do populate history, and we have a very human need for them which can be life-affirming. But Raphael's disdain for heroic individual effort, and his obsessive belief that only \\"communitarian\\" effort has value, comes off as heavy-handed propaganda itself. Take the first chapter. Paul Revere did make that memorable ride to warn the patriots the British were coming. That it wasn't all that renowned until Longfellow later wrote a poem about it, and romanticized the episode, doesn't take away from Revere's heroism. But for the author, Revere's individual effort is an affront to the nameless patriots who also acted heroically. So it goes, in every chapter, the author peppers us with the embroidery that has accrued to historical figures, in an attempt to pull them off their pedestals, and then warn us that our American heroes had warts. As if a multitude of contemporary historians hadn't already pointed that out."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"It is a very rare occurrence when I will put a book down before finishing it, but that is what happened with Ray Raphael's Founding Myths. As I read through the first nine chapters, I kept asking myself, what is it that Mr. Raphael is trying to accomplish. It did not seem to me that his chapters on Paul Revere, Molly Pitcher and Sam Adams served any purpose other than to marginally debunk these individuals and circumstances. He does not discount effectively that they were real people and real contributors to our founding. Also, should we now move the Valley Forge National Park to Morristown, NJ because the winter there was the more severe? Does it matter that \\"do not fire till you see the whites of their eyes\\" was only one of the cries at Bunker Hill and yet is the one most acknowledged?I do not find Mr. Raphael's research and conclusions nearly as believable or having the same merit as Joseph Ellis' or David McCullough's even though he criticizes these historians in his book. For me, Mr. Raphael's so called myths are not convincingly proven or relevant to the miracle of this country's beginnings."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"This author makes the claim that we don't know for sure what Patrick Henry said in his \\"Liberty or Death\\" speech, and then with a quick slide of the hand turns that into a definite statement that he did not say anything that Wirt claims he did. At least Wirt had a source for his claim. Raphael is clearly acting on his desire to raise up the 'everyday hereos' by tearing down the Patrick Henry's. If the person giving the account of Henry's speech 40 years later was an African American or a Native American I bet he would accept it without question. Yet, because it is based on the recollections of a white male (one living in a time without television or video games to have destroyed attention spans), he dismisses it without a second thought. And what is worse, he seems to dismiss the significance of the speech itself(regardless of what was said). Henry did inspire his listeners to join in his call to arms. A far more important feature of his speech (than the wording).If you waste your time reading this propaganda, I think you will agree that Raphael clearly states that we can't be sure what Henry said but then also states he definitely did not say what Wirt claims he did. This is what is defined as a contradiction."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"A screed. A boring, preachy screed. \\"I'm smarter than all of those other historians, and I'm going to tell you why they all lied to you.\\" Over and over and over again.He starts off with two chapters about very minor stories that just about any decently-read person knows are mostly fabrications: Paul Revere and Molly Pitcher. I guess he was going for the low-hanging fruit. Nothing says \`Great book about the Revolutionary War' than 18 pages about Molly Pitcher.Then he actually educates us a little bit about Massachusetts Revolution of 1774 and the worse-than-Valley Forge winter stay of the Continental Army troops in Morristown, NJ in 1780, both times in his preachy, condescending writing style. Then another chapter of stuff pretty much any educated person knows: Thomas Jefferson didn't write the Declaration of Independence entirely on his own.I finally had to toss the book onto the reject pile after, in trying to determine if the Founding Fathers were the Greatest Generation, he spent three pages trying to define the word \`great' in such a way as to bolster his argument.There may have been some interesting information in here, but it was written in such an irritation fashion that I didn't quite get to all of it."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"As the continental army supported by militia made up of farmers and craftsman stormed the Winter Palace. Oops wrong Revolution. As a student of history I feel that much of what we think is our collective history and what we think about our historical figures must be de-mythologized. That being said Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past by Ray Raphael is just a whiny tome. The first clue is when you see anything on a book jacket referring to a \\"peoples\\" history. That is a sure indication that the subject matter will be presented from a Marxist point of view.Much of what the author states in this book is fact and should be made known. But, the writing comes across as bitter. Mr. Raphael seems upset that every school student does not feel guilty about our history. He puts forth the idea that if every 6 year old were taught nothing but the uncensored unadulterated truth about our nation the United States would essentially be Switzerland. He devotes a whole chapter to the film The Patriot. One can only ponder if anyone told him, \\"Hey, Ray, it's only a movie.\\" Would Mr. Raphael put forth the same ire about the film JFK? After reading this book, I doubt it.The author, so wrapped up in his own historic self-righteousness, makes reading this book tedious. And that is a shame because he obviously, to his credit, did a lot of research. The author obviously does not understand the part myth and hero worship play in all socities. Ray Raphael needs to read a book like Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody by Will Cuppy to show how you can de-mythologize history and people and not take yourself so seriously. If you read the conclusion of this book you see that some school districts and states have adopted it as source material in teaching US history. My only thought here is that if they did or do they should have therapists on hand to treat the depression of those children between 5 and 15."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"This review is a bit off topic as it is not so much the content of the book I take issue with, but the physical book itself.The book is so poorly made that it is virtually impossible to pleasurably read it.

He then beats that dead horse for page after tedious page. Particularly annoying is his attack on the movie, The Patriot. Of course, that movie is ridiculouly ahistorical - no need to beat that dead horse either. He has a point in the whole thing - that the Revolution was more than just Washington, Adams and Jefferson - but the whole book would have been much better if it had been about 90% shorter.Ironically, for a book whose whole intent is to debunk other \\"histories\\", Raphael makes several historical errors, especially in regard to the naval aspects. He reports the the French fleet was \\"captured\\" at the battle of the Saintes. Not so. Only 5 of the 30 French ships of the line were captured in the battle. (2 others, detached before the battle, were later captured.) Perhaps Raphael read that deGrasse was captured in the battle and he inferred that meant the whole French fleet, rather than the person. Also, in the invasion scare of 1779, Rapahel reports that the Franco-Spanish fleet had 66 \\"boats\\" in the English Channel. What they had was 66 ships of the line plus large numbers of smaller ships. Finally, he refers to Holland joining the French & Spanish alliance in 1780 without mentioning that it was Britain that declared war on Holland and that launched a pre-emptive surprise attack on the Dutch island of St. Eustacius. He refers to the Dutch contesting the North Sea, when they were in fact quickly removed as a significant force at the battle of Dogger Bank."},{"Title":"Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past","review":"In Paul Revere's report on his famous ride he said that Dr. Joseph Warren requested that he ride to Lexington with a message for Samuel Adams and John Hancock that a number of soldiers were headed their way.

The resulting interrogation was the most important part of the night for him. He also mentioned that a second rider, Mr. William Dawes was also sent out and carried the same message to Adams and Hancock. In his report there is no mention of 'one if by land, two if by sea.' In 1861 the Longfellow poem was published, eight-six years after the fact. And this is what we remember.The Paul Revere chapter is one of thirteen in this book that attempts to show real, documented truth as it actually happened rather than the way the stories are handed down today.

I read this while finishing up my degree in History. It is an amazing book that goes through commonly held ideas about the Founding Fathers and the events surrounding the Revolution. This book is not for everyone. Raphael is an actual Historian and cites other well-known historians who focus on the Revolution, like Pauline Maier and Alfred Young. Unlike McCullough, Raphael is a real historian with a doctorate to prove it. He will go from source to source proving his point, like any historian. And like any historian, he fills up the back of the book with pages and pages of sources. This book may seem to agaisnt the grain, but it in fact does not. It is the first truly popular book that gets the point across that has been held by most historians in the field of the Revolution. The point is that it was not a Revolution led by a few great men, but by the People. The People in fact drove the Revolution and the Founders caught on at the end.The ideas in this book may seem far-fetched, but this is nothing new for people who have studied history in college and so on.

As we follow this unhappy couple, we watch Kaname come increasingly under the influence of his conservative, traditional father-in-law, becoming more and more fascinated with old traditions--wearing the kimono, visiting the Bunraku puppet theatre, and appreciating the behavior of O-hisa, his father-in-law's doll-like mistress--while Misako relentlessly pursues materialistic and selfish goals, presumably western.Tanazaki creates beautifully realized domestic scenes, and his subtle dialogue reveals character by what is not said as much by what is said. Kaname is a sympathetic character torn by his culture and loyalties, a man at the mercy of a cultural tradition which he also embraces. The culture itself is presented lucidly, allowing the reader to admire both the depth of its traditions and the forms, artistic and otherwise, through which it is expressed. This fascinating novel offers a westerner much to contemplate as we see how our emphasis on the individual engenders inevitable conflicts with societies valuing tradition and cultural uniformity. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"I use this book where I teach in conjunction with Tanizaki's essay on Japanese aesthetics, &quot;On Praise of Shadows.&quot; Read together, they rate a &quot;10.&quot; Some Prefer Nettles is rich in understatement and irony, most of which is appreciated having read the essay. Kaname's struggle is not local to the time and place of Japan c. 1930; it is a human struggle to understand one's relationship to one's community, regardless of the culture. It's so resonant perhaps because it is autobiographical. Missing in broad strokes are Tanizaki's characteristic fetishes; however, the book is wonderfully written and contains interesting anthropological insights for the non-Japanese reader. Again, with &quot;Shadows...&quot; a highly recommended novel."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels, and I have read it about once a year for the last ten. It is a beautiful illustration of cultural struggle, as well as the personal frustrations of a marriage falling apart. It ends in classic Japanese style-- uncertainly-- allowing the reader to wonder and imagine what happens next."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"I was accustomed to thinking all Japanese literature was the same after I read Mishima and Murakami but it seems I was mistaken. As the summary puts it, the story revolves around an impending divorce, a very normal situation, nothing close to Murakami and Mishima's fantasy worlds. Indeed it is a very slow book, something most people mistake to be a terrible thing in a book. The slowness I believe is intentional. Tanizaki's work is similar to modernist works that I have read in its emphasis on daily life and personal thoughts without any reference, or any rush to some actual plot. Without a plot to advance, Tanizaki chooses a different route. There is no beginning nor ending. It's simply a \\"photograph\\" of a particular episode. I haven't had much exposure to plotless fiction so I can't adhere to any standard.The themes in the book are fairly obvious. The difficulty resides mainly in the Westerner, who is essentially looking through a small window into Japanese culture. It's akin to staring into an empty dark house, vaguely recognizing the silhouettes of furniture. What is the the Tokyo \\"natural reserve\\"? The Osaka \\"openness\\"? Why does it matter that Osaka puppets are superior to Awaji puppets? It's all very interesting, but it bears no personal significance to an outsider. Tanizaki has preserved cultures and behaviors that probably no longer exist in Japan. It's partially depressing because one can longer experience Tanizaki's world, but on the other hand, it's a relief because the oppressive aspects of the culture have long disappeared."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"This was a fantastic book. I had never read anything else by this author and so started this book with absolutely no expectations. I had picked it up at a used book shop (I love those stores!) and was so taken with the book I finished it in one sitting. It seems that most of the books I've been reading recently have concerned themselves with the conflict between modernity and tradition and none have done so so adeptly as this one. Five stars for Some Prefer Nettles and recommended to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"This work centers around a married couple who have been very distant from each other for some time. Divorce is always being thought of &amp; talked about, but is never carried out. The wife has been having an affair with another man for quite some time. Their son is caught in the middle, suspecting what's going on, but never being filled in by his parents. A relative takes care of that, telling the boy about their troubles on an out-of-town trip. The book has an ending that's familiar to Japanese literature....it bewilders the reader. The story isn't wrapped up &amp; the reader is left with possible endings swirling in his imagination. A brilliant work of art."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"Kaname and Misako are a couple who have grown apart emotionally and have decided to divorce. However, Kaname and Misako are both very passive, each deferring to the other on what to do at any given point, derailing any real action from happening. As their inaction goes on and on, things change and Kaname finds himself drawn more and more into a traditional way of thinking, and Misako gets more and more modern in her way of thinking as she is rather forced by the situation to get more involved with her lover. Finally a decision is forced when Misako's father is told what is going on and he insists on talking to both of them.This book was rather tedious to read and I had to force myself to finish it. There was a lot of internal and external dialogue as to what to do, divorce, not to divorce, and so on. It goes on and on, back and forth, and I found my mind wondering. Then there was the constant discussion about the differences between Tokyo vs. Osaka vs. Kyoto \\"ites\\" stereotypical attributes and sense of aesthetics in the arts, especially Puppet Theater, as well as much internal dialogue by Kaname about modern vs. traditional ideas as he finds himself drawn more and more to the traditional as he ages.I lived in Japan for many years and as of the mid 90's much of the ideas and way of thinking represented in this book still lives on, except for divorce, which no longer carries the stigma it did in those days. Differences between prefectures and people of those places are important to and brought up often by the Japanese themselves and so I found this book extremely interesting on that level alone as this book could have easily been written recently. It's a very in depth representation of Japanese culture and worth reading for that alone."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"Kaname and Misako are considering divorce. Misako has already taken a lover. Misako's father believes they are too attracted to being modern and reminds Kaname of the pleasures of tradition. TANIZAKI Junichiro's novel richly evokes 1920s Japan as well as the struggles of marriage.SOME PREFER NETTLES is a quiet work. Things are said subtly, ironically, or not stated at all. It sometimes makes the novel hard to approach. But while it may seem too esoteric, it reinforces the domesticity of the setting. It's a very nice translation too, which keeps the language beautiful instead of ridiculous.Generational conflict is universal. But rarely does culture change so rapidly as when Japan westernized. Kaname and his wife listen to jazz. Kaname and his father-in-law go to the bunraku theatre. The old versus new conflict is expressed by a culture few Americans are familiar with. I feel like Tanizaki does a good job of explaining the various arts in the novel, so that those who have no idea what bunraku is can still enjoy the story.I enjoyed SOME PREFER NETTLES, although I'm sure by enjoyment was influenced by my interest in Japanese music and performing arts. But I think people truly enjoy Tanizaki's novel due to the rich emotions. While SOME PREFER NETTLES is quiet, it's never spare. It's full of lush imagery and harsh dilemmas.From In Bed With Books"},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"This was the first Tanizaki novel I read and I still like it better than &quot;The Key&quot; or &quot;Diary of a Mad Old Man,&quot; both good books and seemingly more popular in the US. The best theme in modern Japanese literature, in my opinion, is the conflict between traditional and modern (i.e. Western) cultures, and this book explores that theme well. The smug protagonist who begins to question what he considers to be modern thinking makes for interesting reading, and is a good illustration for studying modern Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"Other reviews will give you the plot. I just want to warn readers new to this author that his novels move slowly and invariably concern the struggle between \\"old\\" Japanese traditions and the explosion of \\"Westernism\\" thrust upon Japan after WW II. Be aware that classic Japanese (and Chinese) novels are flavored with many references to nature, art, dance and poetry plus social mores that sound strange to a western ear. For example, in The Key, a husband has been married to his wife for many years and yet never seen her totally naked. He adores her feet, but she constantly covers them up!To really appreciate his writing you should read, as a minimum, The Key, The Makioka Sisters and Some Prefer Nettles. All are outstanding."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"Formatting warning for Kindle readers. The formatting of the footnotes is terrible. They pop up in the middle of paragraphs sometimes even pages away from the reference, vary extremely in font size (sometimes same size as the rest of the text, sometimes super small font) and worst of all are incomplete with cut offs mid sentence. For the price being charged for the Kindle version at the moment that's unacceptable.For the actual book: 5 stars. Beautifully written and very direct story of a Japanese man being tugged between the choice for modern western life and the traditional lifestyle and the women connected to those lifestyles and choices. Quiet unhappiness in marriage without actual fights or even dislike and the main character's inactive, passive way of dealing with this seem to be reoccurring themes for Tanizaki."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"This is a novel about the old and the young generation in the 1920s in Japan.A couple of the new one wants to separate because their sexual passion has disappeared. The father of the woman tries to convince the couple to continue to stay together.\\"The reason for their decision to separate was that they did not want to grow old, that they wanted to be free to live their youth again.\\" (p.31)The novel is autobiographic and symbolic, which is well explained by the well-known and outstanding translator E. Seidensticker.But the story should more appeal to the Japanese than to foreign readers, because it refers regularly to authentic Japanese themes as the old and new Japanese puppet theatre or the motif of the woman as a doll.It is shrouded in a sad and melancholic atmosphere.Only for the Tanizaki aficionados."},{"Title":"Some Prefer Nettles","review":"Elusive, difficult, and elegant are three adjectives which I would use to describe this 1928 Tanizaki text. Anybody interested in the dialogue between Asia and the West should definitely give this one a read, despite the occasional heavy-handed Freudian references."},{"Title":"Harry Potter Y La Camara Secreta (Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets) (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Spanish Edition)","review":"...The translators chose idiomatic expressions particular to certain regions of Spanish-speaking countries, when common words would have been satisfactory. As if that was not bad enough, they also chopped up the narrative. This is not an abridged version, but a truncated one, as if they were in a hurry to finish the book or save pages. If Spanish is your second language, be aware that you may not understand some terms. Just skip them and memorize the names of the translators, so you won't buy another book ruined by them.Yet. . . the story is fascinating and the suspense in the plot is captivating. Even if the Spanish rendition of loses flavor due to poor translation, I was amazed, surprised, thrilled and fascinated all over again, and I was especially overjoyed to share with my daughter the excitement of the conspiracies and the joy of reading.I just hope that when the fourth and fifth books are translated to Spanish, the Spanish-speaking people will get an un-butchered version."},{"Title":"Harry Potter Y La Camara Secreta (Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets) (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Aconsejo no prestar demasiada atenci&oacute;n a las cr&iacute;ticas que se quejan del vocabulario castizo en contraposici&oacute;n al vocabulario americano.

There is much vocabulary from Spain, just as the English version has much British vocabulary. I really enjoy learning about regional vocabulary differences, whether in English or Spanish, so this was a big plus.A friend claims the American editions have been Americanized, although I don't know if it's true. (The American editions still have many British words, but do use some American words, like &quot;sweater&quot; instead of &quot;jumper&quot;.) It's funny how the Brits understand us from seeing our movies/television, but we don't understand their vocab or accent as well. It's great to be exposed to different forms of languages we already know.The translation seems very good, but some things seem wrong, such as &quot;?QUE TE TENGO DICHO?&quot; on the second page of text. I think this should be &quot;?QUE TE HE DICHO?&quot; Maybe this is a form with which I'm not familiar, because I can't imagine a native speaker and translator would make such a gringo (&quot;guiri&quot; en Espana) mistake."},{"Title":"Harry Potter Y La Camara Secreta (Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets) (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I read the first Harry Potter book in Spanish, and while it wasn't a perfect translation, I really enjoyed it. I was fluent enough that I averaged having about 1 or 2 (and often none) words that I had to look up per page, so I was excited when I finished and quickly ordered the second book. Well, it arrived, and with a shock I realized I could barely get through this one. The reading is extremely slow due to the fact I have to look up so many words per page (and many of them aren't even in my (very good) Spanish-English dictionary), and because even when the words are ones I know, the whole way the sentences are structured is different and much more difficult from the traditional Spanish I know (I've studied in school and lived in Mexico in order to become fluent). I checked and sure enough, the books were translated by different people. The translators of this book (and the third and fourth, unfortunately) are from Spain, and as such, use a lot of very Spain-specific vocabulary, idioms, and sentence structures (and the vosotros verb form), that, while still being readable, make the book much more difficult and less enjoyable. I got bored and quit somewhere in chapter five, because instead of reading and enjoying a story, I was laboriously and constantly switching back and forth between my dictionary and the actual book.If you are from Spain or have learned your Spanish in a Spain context, versus in Latin America, I'm sure this book will be a great translation and very fun to read.

The book begins with three chapters that tell us how to encourage the inquisitive nature of young children and nurture their science skills, how to organize a science unit, and how to make the language connection with science. These chapters are very clearly written in a pleasing format, so they are user-friendly even to the scientifically illiterate (like me). The rest of the chapters cover topics such as weather, animals, seed-bearing plants,and ecology in a beautifully organized fashion. Each unit begins with a list of objectives and a good base of information on the topic for the adult. Then the activities and procedures section begins, starting with the easiest and most concrete lessons and progressing to more difficult ones. Thus, each unit is ideally suited to families with siblings of all ages. At the end of each unit are lists of further rescources, grouped for children, adults and older children, and literature connections for younger children. There are also suggestions for field trips and other community connections. One thing I like about this book and its companion volume, Teaching Children About Physical Science, is that the graphics are pleasing and the text is easy to follow. But also, the author has a sound appreciation for how children's curiosity about the natural world around them easily creates opportunities for making science moments happen.

And the last line of the book makes me smile time and time again. I think I may it enjoy it more than my children. Get it. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Only Nine Chairs (Passover)","review":"What I like most about this book is that it is so differentfrom the average Jewish children's book. Instead of going through theseder and what each thing symbolizes, it tells a humorous story about a girl worried that there will not be sufficient seating at her family's seder table. Its a funny book, that just happens to occur during Pesach. A real treat."},{"Title":"Only Nine Chairs (Passover)","review":"This book has been bringing a smile to my face for twenty + years.

Carleton; ISBN 0201604442).Where the later book focused on measurement techniques that spanned the entire development life cycle, this one is confined to the narrower topic of defects. What I like about this book, and why it isn't superseded by the later one, is the way it comprehensively covers all phases of defect management. The chapters are sequenced as follows: (1) a short introduction that covers the book's scope and discusses problems and defects within the context of software engineering environments, (2) a framework for counting problems and defects, (3) problem and defect attributes, (4) an example defect problem count definition checklist, (5) an example problem count request form, (6) an example problem definition status form [Note that reproducible forms for the examples given in 4 through 6 are provided in Appendix C], (7) a summary of the framework for counting problems and defects that tie together the preceding chapters. Chapter 8 provides recommendations that are more fully explored in the 1999 book I cited above, Appendix A is a glossary that is valuable to anyone new to measurement practices, and Appendix B is a collection of examples of how to use measurement results - Project Tracking-System Test, Tracking Customer Experience, and Improving the Software Product and Process.If you are a member of an SQA team or PMO, or are involved with product quality improvement I strongly recommend this book as an introduction to problem and defect counting. The framework is well thought out, and the in-depth discussion of all facets of the topic represents one of the most complete and focused despite the fact that this technical report was written over a decade ago."},{"Title":"The Cenci (The Library of liberal arts, 170)","review":"Percy Shelley's tragedy &quot;The Cenci&quot; is a lyrical and intense gothic melodrama set in late 1500's Italy. The play centers around the lives of the noble house of Cenci, which is daily terrorized by Francesco Cenci, head of the household. Francesco is molded in the style of other gothic villains, such as Radcliffe's Montoni and Walpole's Manfred, yet he manages to stand apart from them.Cenci is, in both word and deed, more insistently evil than either of the aforementioned figures. Cenci's purpose, unlike the other two, is not to increase his wealth, or secure his lineage, but instead to bring both to ruin. From the beginning of the play, Cenci seeks to eliminate his entire family. He firmly believes that his curses are heard and enacted simply because he is the authority figure in his home.Beatrice, Cenci's daughter, and her step-mother, Lucretia live in a state of constant apprehension and fear of Cenci. Beatrice is the tragic heroine of Shelley's play, whose beauty, apparent intelligence, and strong will prepare her only to be fully aware of the injustices of her father, common law, and religious law, and her inability to enlist the mercy of any of them to aid her family.As Beatrice, her family, and friends, attempt to wrangle out of Cenci's designs, they find themselves drawn into a whirlpool of desperate acts. The gender issues and politics of the play indicate the helplessness of women, be they strong (Beatrice) or weak (Lucretia), and point out a total disdain for autocratic and aristocratic rule, be it familial or otherwise.Written in 1819, only a few years after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, these issues may be a direct response to the disillusionment of Shelley, a second-generation Romantic poet, with the failure of the French Revolution to affect any real change. Poetically, it may echo his doubts about the effects of the Romantic visionary imagination. At any rate, &quot;The Cenci&quot; is a well-written, if occasionally outlandish tragedy, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Cenci (The Library of liberal arts, 170)","review":"Shelley's The Cenci is just one of many tellings of a true story that captures the imagination and the heart of almost everybody who hears of it. The story has been retold in many novels, even in opera.It is the tale of the lovely and innocent Beatrice Cenci, who in late 16th century Rome was molested by a corrupt and powerful father, Count Francesco Cenci. Her father was so well-connected that there was no one, not even the Pope, to whom she could turn for protection. So, with the help of her mother and her brother, she seeks the ultimate revenge and pays the price.Shelley's poetic drama is considered one of the best works of his short life. His treatment is more Shakespearean than poetic, but without the immortal bard's light comic touches. The Cenci is true tragedy through and through with a poetic touch that will capture the soul of the reader. I found myself reading passages aloud to myself to both hear the dramatic content and to better understand the meaning of dialogs broken into lines of poetry. This is not an easy book to read, both for its subject and its writing style, yet the reward is well worth the effort. Some of Shelley's greatest lines are in this work. Here is a brief segment from the 5th Act of Beatrice's words in contemplating her fate:Oh, trample out that thought! Worse than Despair,Worse than the bitterness of death, is hope;It is the only ill which can find placeUpon the giddy, sharp and narrow hourTottering beneath us. Plead with the swift frostThat it should spare the eldest flower of spring;Plead with awakening earthquake, o'er whose couchEven now a city stands, strong, fair, and free;Now stench and blackness yawn, like death. Oh, pleadwith famine, or wind-walking Pestilence,Blind lightning, or the deaf sea, not with man!Cruel, cold, formal man; righteous in words,In deeds a Cain."},{"Title":"The Cenci (The Library of liberal arts, 170)","review":"The Cenci is a tragic five-act play written and published in 1819 by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The work was one of Shelley's most critically acclaimed works and was his only work that was published in a second edition during his lifetime. The play was Shelley's most accessible work and the one for which he planned and anticipated not only critical acceptance, but popular acclaim as well. The controversial themes of parricide and incest prevented the play from achieving popular success during his lifetime.Shelley explained in the preface that the purpose of the play lies in \\"teaching the human heart\\": \\"The highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the knowledge of itself.\\" Tragedy results due to flaws in human nature or to events or circumstances that we cannot control. Each person, however, has freedom of will or a choice. Our own decisions determine whether tragedy is the outcome. Beatrice Cenci, the victim of an incestuous rape, chose to retaliate. Shelley wrote that peace and love were the appropriate responses to injustice and crime: \\"Undoubtedly, no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another; and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance, and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love. Revenge, retaliation, atonement, are pernicious mistakes.\\" It was by making these pernicious mistakes that Beatrice Cenci revealed her human flaws that ultimately culminated in tragedy.The tragedy, based on a historical event, is set in Rome in 1599. Beatrice Cenci is raped by her father, Francesco Cenci, although Shelley never used that term and the nature of the crime is left ambiguous. She then seeks retaliation against her father by planning his murder. By executing this plan, she subverts and destabilizes the established hierarchical and patriarchal norms and dogmas of authority of her time, upsetting the accepted order. Her parricide becomes a revolutionary act that must be punished to the fullest extent of the law to preserve the status quo and to maintain stability.Mary Shelley described the play as \\"the best tragedy of modern times.\\" She called the Fifth Act \\"a masterpiece\\" and emphasized that Shelley intended the play to be acted on the stage. Lord Byron wrote that the play was \\"a work of power and poetry\\" although he questioned whether it would succeed as a drama on the stage. Byron, nevertheless, concluded: \\"The Cenci is ... perhaps the best tragedy modern times have produced.\\"Beatrice Cenci struggles to find a way to confront oppression. She states that \\"what a world we make/ The oppressor and the oppressed.\\" Her brother Giacomo as well perceives himself as oppressed: \\"We are now no more, as once, parent and child, But man to man; the oppressor to the oppressed; The slanderer to the slandered; foe to foe: He has cast Nature off, which was his shield, And Nature casts him off.\\" They are, however, \\"as scorpions ringed with fire\\", who in popular myth, will sting themselves to death rather than be consumed by the fire.The Cenci is a dramatic masterpiece that examines justice and injustice, the role of the oppressed and the oppressor, and how human flaws result in tragedy. Ultimately, it is an attempt in \\"teaching the human heart.\\""},{"Title":"The Cenci (The Library of liberal arts, 170)","review":"The Cenci is not only Percy Shelley's most underrated work but one of the most underrated of all English dramas - nothing less than one of the best plays in the three centuries between the genre's Elizabethan height and its late Victorian resurrection. An excellent verse drama, it is one of the last of its kind, coming a few decades before prose became standard. As one would expect from a poet turning to drama, the verse quality is very high, reaching lyrical heights of extreme emotion and frequent beauty. Much of it is also very memorable, not so much epigrammatic as simply mesmerizing. Yet, unlike many verse dramas, it is believable as natural dialogue; Shelley somehow manages to play both ends well, as only the very greatest verse dramatists can.The story itself is more of a departure for Shelley. In contrast to his wildly creative and often intensely personal poetry, this is a historical drama. The tragedy of the Cenci family had been well-known for centuries and was in many ways ideal for drama; the unbelievably tragic tale of a man so evil as to be bent on destroying his own family only for them to be executed for his arguably just death could hardly be treated otherwise. Specific details were few, and Shelley essentially uses the basic outline and fills in the rest. The story would have been familiar to the audience had the play been produced, but Shelley's twists would have been more than compelling. He plays up the inherent drama for all it is worth and adds other lurid details, making for a highly wrought play that grabs attention quickly and keeps it. The result may be somewhat melodramatic, but we must remember the factual basis; Shelley may even underplay much of what happened for all anyone knows.The characters are also vividly memorable. Beatrice Cenci is one of the great pre-modern female parts, strong and highly sympathetic. Shelley was far ahead of his time in making a lead female character so independent, articulate, and powerful; this is one of the clearest signs of his proto-feminism and perhaps a large part of the reason the play was not staged for almost a century. Her many lines and their highly emotional nature make her a very difficult role; only the greatest actors can pull her off convincingly without being overdone. This is perhaps even more true of her father, who is one of literature's great villains - fully evil and thoroughly despicable. The same can again be said for most of the other characters in varying degrees.However, the play is not all melodrama and poetry; like Shelley's other work, it is notable for successfully mixing artistry with intellectual depth and political content. This last is muted beside his more politically explicit work, but he does touch on issues like the nature of justice, the fairness of the \\"justice system,\\" a man's responsibility toward his family, women's rights, etc. The play is very thought-provoking on top of being extremely moving and entertaining. Debate about its onstage feasibility continues despite several successful performances, but The Cenci is definitely a great piece of literature and should be read by anyone interested in Shelley, English verse drama, historical drama, or simply great writing.As for which edition to buy, the dedicated will want a deluxe standalone such as this, but most will be well served by a Shelley anthology including it. Whatever method is chosen, one will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Girl with a Monkey: New and Selected Stories","review":"What's amazing about Michaels is how seamlessly he transitioned from an experimental realist to a master of the realistic short story form. His early stories are marked by a linguistic self-apparency, though he's funny enough to keep it interesting. And, unlike others in this vein, his style is blatantly influenced by Kafka and Beckett. Sometimes the description in the early stories can be too thick, exhausting the possibilites of each situation. The language in the best of them, however - \\"In The Fifties,\\" \\"Manikin\\" (The one about the Turk, I think) - have a wonderful interplay of signifiers, like poetry. \\"In The Fifties\\" is an ironized (sp.) list poem in the style of Ginsberg's \\"Howl\\".The later stories acheive such a transparency you can forget how funny they are. Michaels is a master of form. They are narrated in a natural, subdued manner, unlike the glossy, journalistic style we get from some of our other first tier writers. The differentiated narrative strands merge together gradually as the story progresses.Thematically, Michaels' stories are interesting because they are often set on the cusp of the sexual revolution, and there is much confusion about gender roles in relationships. All in all, one of the best books I've read in awhile."},{"Title":"A Girl with a Monkey: New and Selected Stories","review":"I kept looking for new books by Leonard Michaels and then was crushed to hear he'd passed away.

Especially for children making the transition to chapter books. It is well written and easy to read. It deals with problems in which children can easily idenitfy. Marc Brown gives great detail to Authur's anxiety of the unknown contents of the envelope. His writing certainly brings back my own childhood experiences. The pictures in this book allow children to identify with the charcaters and help them draw a mental picture of the story.

A satisfying story."},{"Title":"Arthur's mystery envelope","review":"Hello. You can call me StoryMaker. I read Arthur's Mystery Envelope (Arthur chapter book #1) because I just had to know what was in the envelope. It really shocked me. This was a fun book to read. I think the reading level is just right for me - the text is easy to understand and I am old enough for longish chapter books. This book is long but not too long - a very nice reading level. In this book, Arthur is sent to the principal's office and is given an envelope that he is supposed to bring to his mom. What could the message inside be? He thinks it might be about having school in the summer. His friends give him different kinds of advice. What's inside? Read to find out the surprising answer. Something I don't like is that Arthur's day dream when he's doing homework and Arthur's dream at night are creepy. Not exactly scary, but weird and creepy. Also, when Arthur was doing his homework and he got \\"Think of a word that rhymes with 'hope' and 'rope'\\" I thought that he was mad because it was too easy but then after a while I realized \\"envelope\\" was why Arthur was mad. That homework still is far too easy for a kid his age. Still, the overall rating remains 4 stars because of the great story.

Arthur has always been one of my favorite TV shows. Therefore I decided to read one of the books based on it. I was very much impressed as to how good the story was, and in par with the TV show.The story starts off with Arthur and his friends, enjoying their time in school, when an announcement is made for Arthur to come to the Principal's office. Arthur is very nervous, because nobody gets called to the principal's office unless they are in trouble, and Arthur doesn't even remember what he did. When he goes to see Mr. Haney (The Principal), he gives Arthur a sealed envelope with the words \`private' and \`confidential' stamped on it, and tells Arthur to give it to his mother. Arthur is now scared, and starts wondering as to whether he should give the envelope to his mother or not. The book continues with Arthur's friends giving him advice on what he should do with the envelope, and in the end, revealing what the envelope actually contains and whether Arthur gives it to his mother or not.This is a great book for young children, as it provides a very good moral that you should face your troubles, not hide or run from it. Even adults will find the book humorous at times, when reading this story to their children. I would recommend this book to anyone having children, as it will be a good way to spend time with your kids by reading this story with them. Even if you don't have children, you will enjoy reading this book if you like the TV show."},{"Title":"Why we believe the Bible","review":"This book has been one of my favorites for years, a very interesting and easy read.

Unlike others, however, this treatment begins with three very specific essays placing the Life of Christ within the historical record. The first of these deals with the Birth of Christ, which the author places in 5 BC, far too early for comfort in relation to Luke's statement that Christ began his ministry when he was \\"about 30 years old.\\" The second is on the date of the baptism of Christ, and the final is on the date of the crucifixion of Christ, which the author places at 30 AD, a date that has been shown to be too early by three years by modern reckoning.From this point, Andrews launches into the main body of his text, covering the life of Christ in chronological sequence. Using the date he gives for the birth of Christ as his origination point, he arranges his work by date, rather than by event, as others do, with intermediate essays providing overviews of each section. For instance, section two covers the events from the baptism of Christ to the beginning of his ministry in Galilee. This section begins with two essays discussing the division of the life of Christ and the ministry of Christ in Judea. These two essays are followed by chapters on the summer of the year 779 (26AD), four chapters on various months within 780 (27AD), and one chapter on the first few months of the year 781 (28AD). This organization can be quite confusing, particularly since the dates are given in with the founding of Rome as year 1, rather than in the more modern notation of BC/AD (or even the objectionable CE).In spite of this organization, and the general dryness of the writing, there are many passages of note here. Andrews is meticulous in his organization, bringing out every previous reading or understanding of a particular passage, and all the supporting evidence he has for each view. For instance, the section on the two genealogies, and why they don't match, is closely argued --one is the genealogy of Joseph, the other of Mary. His section on the promise of God to David to have a descendent on the Throne of Israel forever is also well argued and interesting.Overall, this is a good reference for those studying the life of Christ, even though it's not the sort of book you might pick up and read simply for the pleasure of reading it."},{"Title":"Mastering Crystal Reports 9","review":"Here are the good points:. the examples do follow through many of the features of Crystal Reports 9Here are the bad points:. there is a lot of unnecessary verbiage which pads out the size of the book; the verbiage is intended to make the text friendly, but for someone trying to determine how a feature works, it is highly obstructive and irritating. the typeface in which the book is set is quite difficult to read. the examples do not pass on understanding of the principles of each feature; the attempt to grasp a general concept gets drowned in the details. many features (too numerous to mention) are glossed-over, including advanced features needed by the enterprise programmer. the index includes references which are totally useless (e.g. McLuhan, Marshall who has absolutely nothing to do with the topic) and lacks completely necessary references. while not a &quot;1,200 page tome&quot; (see another review) it is a 639 page tomeWhile the title includes the word &quot;Master&quot;, this book is really for the programming beginner.

Some of the writers are primarily popularizers (Isaac Asimov, Rachel Carson, Walter Sullivan) and some are scientists who made an especial effort to write for the public (Arthur S. Eddington, Stephen Jay Gould, Carl Sagan), but some of the pieces are by and for scientists, just sufficiently accessible to be included here (as with the articles by Darwin, Wallace, Kepler, and Helmholtz). The pieces run the gamut of the sciences-astronomy, biology, geology, physics-and a gamut of issues relating to the sciences, from the process of discovery (Mach talking about the human sense of position) to philosophy (Bacon and Popper) to observational notes (Darwin on Galapagos finches and Galileo on his first look through a telescope). There are breathtaking excerpts from the moment when a new science is born: Alfred Russel Wallace realizing the concept of natural selection, Lavoisier explaining the new organization of substances he has discovered (and thereby setting the foundations of modern chemistry).While reading, I somehow found less interesting than I thought I would, but my problem may be that I have a strong background in the history of science and have been exposed to much of this before. That being said, I am finding that this book is sticking with me in ways that few books do. I continue to think about the articles and recall them.So for anyone who is interested in science or the history of science, who wants to experience science being made, or who just appreciates good, strong writing, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great Science Writing","review":"This is an excellent book! I really enjoyed all the essays by different scientists. It was good to see so many scientists writing clear essays for the &quot;general reader&quot; describing recent advances in their field. The earliest was from Herodotus (444 B.C.), but by far most of the essays were from scientists writing in the 1900's. I have a much better feel and appreciation for the breadth of science after reading this book!"},{"Title":"Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great Science Writing","review":"I now have a new appreciation for Science all because of this book! Reading this was very touching and helped me understand why science is so important to our lives. They even got essay's done by some scientist you have never heard about that are totally irrelevant to what you hear everyday at school, at work, or just walking around. My favorite writings were of Course Galileo's beatiful description of the stars and Jupiter. GREAT BOOK! BUY IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great Science Writing","review":"If you say \\"science\\", most people would probably think back to the tedium of high school science and math class. This book shows what science really is about, namely wonderment at nature's beauty, and the process of understanding its workings. It contains arguably the best writing of many of the big names in science, such as Sagan, Galileo, Newton, Watson, Gould an others. If you have a laypersons interest in science, you will have fun reading Galileo's Commandment. If you do not find science appealing, you will after reading this book!Most of the essays are highly readable. Some are a bit more difficult, especially those written in older English."},{"Title":"Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great Science Writing","review":"Stock full of classic authors.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"This story had no consistency what so ever. At one point, the author forgot the name of the main character. Not to mention, that there were 3 different explanations for the relationship of 1 of the characters parents. I am wondering if anyone even did any proofreading on this story at all. I realize that it is a romance, but the entire plot was left hanging at the end of the book. It seemed like the author was trying to keep the book to a specific number of words or pages and the entire plot was left unresolved."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"Okay one reviewer pointed out that the name swicthed adn i jsut check...honestly i hadn't even picked that up!I agree about the cooking part, the prologue should not have been there in the first place.WE sort of understand if he wanted to get married he would choose her but honestly it wasn't shown int eh rest of the book i think that that part should not have been there!but i loved the book anyway!"},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"Diana Palmer is one of the best authors of books I have read.

What an unhealthy codependent relationship they've got going! Heroine is so codependent, obsequious, & a doormat that even when she overhears the hero blast her about how he really thinks of her she still concedes to his wishes. Ugh! The romance is just not believable. Just hard to see how hero becomes attracted to her when he still sees heroine as extremely insecure, weak, & directionless.DO NOT waste your time reading this book."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"Book Description: Secret Agent Lawman - Ever since DEA agent Alexander Cobb had given Jodie Clayburn a Texas-size brush-off, they'd been sworn enemies. But eight years later, an undercover operation brought them back together again. This cynical Long, Tall Texan couldn't believe the baby-faced schoolgirl was now an understated beauty who electrified his senses and his heart. Or that she'd help him crack the drug-smuggling case that threatened all of Jacobsville. Tantalized to the core, Alexander would risk everything to possess - and protect - the untouched young woman. This fearless secret agent always got his man -- or in this case, woman. But this time, would the man in control get caught in his own web of danger ... and desire?Combine the typical story about the younger sister's best friend's crush-on turned love-for, the older brother with a DEA investigation; add a dash of humor, family issues, esteem issues; then include ties to the Long, Tall Texans of Jacobsville Texas, and the Mercenaries, aka Soldiers of Fortune, within a few pages and you have a story as only Diana Palmer can tell it."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"Jodie Clayburn and Margie Cobb have been best friends all their lives. At 18, Jodie loses her parents in an accident while they are on vacation. Margie's big brother, Alex, steps in to help Jodie. Since then, Jodie has been spending vacations and holidays with Margie and Alex. Jodie has a huge crush on Alex but tries to hide it, but does a very poor job of it. Alex is aware of Jodie's crush and tries to discourage it. When Jodie overhears Alex telling Margie that's he tired of Jodie always being around, Jodie finally decides to distance herself from Margie and Alex. As soon as Alex realizes that Jodie is distancing herself from him, he tires to win her back.I'm not a big Diane Palmer fan. At times I feel her heroes are cruel, especially in her older work. I thought I'd give Ms. Palmer's book another try because this one looked interesting. At the beginning of the book, Alex was a very harsh to Jodie but then more than made up for it later in the book. I'm glad I gave it a try. The change in Jodie during the course of the book was wonderful."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"I love Diana Palmer books, so I expected the main male character in this story to be an a%@ and the female lead to be whimpy and get walked all over, but in this book, Mrs. Palmer went a little too far.I thought that Alex (the male lead) in this story was way too cruel for absolutly no good reason at all. In the first couple of chapters I hated him. Jodie, (the female lead) let Alex insult her like you wouldn't insult your worst enemy. During a party Jodie comes on to Alex and he turns her down. (Sort of) Well, she overhears him talking to his sister, her best friend, and I CANNOT believe that she didn't punch him right in the face for saying what he said about her. After reading that scene, I thought that I would put this book down and quit reading it because it was stupid, but it did get better the more you read. There is a lot of action scenes and as it turns out, Alex needs Jodie's help on a case he is working on so, he does some begging and those parts were great to read. Atleast he is sorry for the things that he said. All in All, this book isn't very long, so I would say read it if you like Diana Palmer books!"},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"This is a typical Palmer read, which means the male protagonist is a chauvinist/misogynist, and the heroine is a lovestruck virgin with no backbone who, it seems, is required to suffer a lot of verbal and emotional abuse and humiliation from him before he is able to realize/admit he loves her, and she then anxiously capitulates. The description of this book was misleading as it gave me the impression that after Jodie overheard Alex's excruciating insults, she finally had enough guts to say \\"who needs this?\\" and cuts her ties with Alex and Margie until, after 8 years, she agrees to help Alex bust drug dealers. Ms. Palmer's stories are interesting and the romance is hot (even though she only \\"alludes\\" to the sex), but I hate that her females are usually victims because they are sexually inexperienced."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"First off, I love Diana Palmer. I'm sure that I've read everything she's ever written, and I've read many of her books over and over and over. This one was a nice distraction for a lazy Sunday afternoon. It started out much in the way as the old Diana Palmer books, which is how I've always loved her work - hardbitten hero who fights tooth and nail against loving the innocent heroine. After the first few chapters, the hero falls head over heels without much fighting, and it's a nice, sweet little story. While I did like the story, I found myself yearning for the style of the original Long, Tall Texans trilogy. But I liked it well enough. What I didn't like was the editing. It read as if Ms. Palmer wrote it very quickly, but the editors should have noticed a couple of things. Firstly, in the first chapter, the heroine's name changed from Jodie to Josie for a page and a half. Not a huge deal. But what really irked me was that in the prologue, the hero is thinking about the heroine and notes to himself that she is a &quot;masterful cook,&quot; but a few chapters later, he is &quot;astonished&quot; and &quot;unusually thoughtful&quot; about finding out that she can cook. These were silly errors and should have been caught and fixed before the book was published. I feel that the editors rush to get her books on the shelf because they're sure-fire sellers, but they owe the readers a better product. Other than that, I'd recommend it was a very light, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Man In Control (Silhouette Desire)","review":"Ever since DEA agent Alexander Cobb had given Jodie Clayburn a Texas-size brush-off, they'd been sworn enemies.

He comes to this minor collection of short stories with credentials in journalism and creative writing. And it seems he has an idea of where he eventually hopes to arrive - in the peopled tarmac called Los Angeles. But in these stories (actually four short stories and a novella from which the collection derives its title) Rifkin pens sketches of ideas of personalities and psychology that in the end are fairly shallow. True, the very isolated psyches of people living on the freeways headed to momentary entanglements with other isolationists might just be a valid view of Angelinos. But to make us care about them we need more fluid style of telling and a few sidebar mirrors to reflect the hollow faces of these folk, perhaps finding a home within our memories when the book is finished. Not quite there yet. But sounds like real stories may come down the multiple off ramps!"},{"Title":"Signal Hill","review":"I was deeply struck as I read the four stories and novella that comprise Alan Rifkin's Signal Hill at how in touch with the human experience the author is. His stories are filled with gentle touches of characters' self deprecating humor, as they realize, through loss, regret, and occasional momentary triumphs, how precious, while maddening, everyday life can be. He gave me a whole new appreciation for Long Beach and its hilltop neighbor, Signal Hill, these good-hearted provincial outposts of the big city that looms just up the Harbor Freeway. His stories remind me of some of the best of Philip Roth's early works. I look forward to reading more revelation from Mr. Rifkin."},{"Title":"Signal Hill","review":"Rifkin can write a sentence like no one since Henry James. The movement and rhythm of his prose suggests the style of a craftsman mixed with the touch of one inspired. The book is not just great technically, though. It's also funny (witness the scene where Richard Leviton gives himself a haircut), moving, and poignant, sometimes all in the same scene.The thing that stands out above all else is the sense that even though all the people Rifkin portrays are firmly grounded--in the Valley, in the desert, in Signal Hill--they're all completely lost in the mindscape that is the real geography of LA. This is the book's great revelation and what will keep readers intrigued as the make their way through the pages as well as interested in coming back to the book again and again."},{"Title":"Signal Hill","review":"\\"Signal Hill\\" , a short story collection published in 2003, glories in the richness and beauty of language. Dazzling metaphor and simile abound, and there is a sensual delight in how words can caress and heal and finally liberate. Because the ornate prose here is not merely a peacock display, it is used as an avenue to wisdom. It is thought provoking. \\"Signal Hill\\" also is part of the Southern California canon, one of the books that define the complexity of this vast and diverse region in terms both insightful and strong in serious literary quality. Other writers who have been part of this tradition include Raymond Chandler, Nathanael West and Joan Didion. As with these writers, Rifkin conveys not just the distinctive physical landscape of the state, but also its sociology and how personality and the culture of the region interact.The book consists of four short stories and culminates with a long story, \\"Signal Hill.\\" It is striking in the first story, \\"The Honor System\\", that the female protagonist, Catherine, one more time embarks on a relationship, perpetually ( if tentatively ) hopeful. Yet it would be simplistic to see this optimism as a hallmark of Rifkin's writing. The stories are shot through with the dense ambiguity of life. At the same time, they are on such a heightened verbal level, that they don't seem \\"realistic\\", any more than opera does. And they have some of the same beauty.The title story revolves around four central characters, who slip and out of involvement with each other in a hypnotic dance. The protagonist, Richard Leviton, is a kind of Southern California middle aged Everyman, and as such is cousin to John Updike's Harry Angstrom ( \\"Rabbit Run\\" and its sequels ), Saul Bellow's Charlie Citrine ( \\"Humboldt's Gift\\" ) and Thomas Berger's Carlo Reinhart ( \\"Crazy in Berlin\\", \\"Vital Parts\\", etc. ). However, Leviton's particular brand of contemporary romanticism does help to \\"place\\" him in Southern California's ever shifting emotional landscape.The only fault I would find with this book is that there's a bit of an embarrassment of riches. The language is so intricately gorgeous, and there is so much wisdom at every turn, that sometimes I wanted the author to slow down. But this is a fault that one can only be happy to find.

Author Kenneth Herrmann takes us on a spiritual journey looking for our collective soul--back to where he lost it many decades before. This time, he has a mission of peace and what he finds and how he is treated makes for some most gripping stories.His book, \\"Lepers and Lunacy an American in Vietnam Today,\\" begins with him preparing himself for this self-discovery trip back to Nam. He tells of an experience in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia where he visits with prisoners in the jails. He was asked by a young woman in prison who had given birth to a baby boy to be the godfather. They went to the prison cathedral for the baptism. Later on he learns that this young girl's baby was taken away and shot, as a way to get others to talk. This is just one of many personal stories that prepare him for what he will face going back to Nam.In Nam he runs into troubles even with his fellow American veterans who do not understand why he is there helping out and being a part of a healing ceremony at a graveyard.This whole book shows the compassionate side of this veteran as he struggles at times, trying to bring aid and comfort to his former enemies. He has to face opposition and hurdles from both sides including paying bribes to officials to bring in needed supplies for their own citizens.There is a book about finding and discovering who you really are as a person. I think the author shows us a huge part of his heart and soul with his true story of his adventure back to Nam and of his eventually creating a non-profit organization to help children.Advocate for human rights - Read article about Author[...]"},{"Title":"Lepers and Lunacy: An American in Vietnam","review":"Kenneth J.

The excellent novelette \\"Second Variety\\" was also made into a movie, albeit not a very good one, \\"Screamers.\\" \\"Second Variety\\" continues to explore the machines as humans theme, and also adds in the difficulty of distinguishing reality from illusion, which became a major recurrent theme in Dick's later novels.

Dick","review":"**** General Overview ****Philip K. Dick is one of the best-known and most influential sci-fi writers of all time. He was renown for his idiosyncratic narratives that challenged our perception of reality. Many of his short stories and novels have been adapted to major Hollywood movies, such as \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Total Recall\\", and \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\".This is a very neat little collection of the early Philip K. Dick stories. The stories vary in quality and reflect PKD's evolution as a writer and storyteller. Nonetheless all of the stories bear the unmistakable imprint of this sci-fi master's unique vision and perspective.**** The Stories ****** Beyond Lies the Wub **This is an extremely short and interesting PKD story. It is written in the inimitable style of this sci-fi legend. The main theme has been explored many times by other authors, but PKD manages to leave his own imprint on it. Due to the story's brevity there is virtually no character development, and a few transitions are a bit rough. In particular the ending, although quite interesting and thought-provoking, leaves too much to suggestion and implication. Nonetheless, this is a very entertaining short sci-fi story.** Beyond the Door **Larry Thomas came home one evening with an unusual gift for his wife Doris: an antique cuckoo clock. Doris was really excited about it, but she has a secret that she is hiding from Larry. When her secret is accidentally revealed later on, the plot takes a quirky and bizarre turn.The story has a feel of an episode of \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" It is very short, and its themes are barely worked out to make a coherent plot. The theme and symbolism of a cuckoo is exploited in a very transparent and in-your-face fashion. Like many of Philip K. Dick's early works, the story relies more on the curiosities than plot-development for its impact.** The Crystal Crypt **\\"Crystal Crypt\\" is a short story that takes place in unspecified future where Mars and Earth (or \\"Terra\\" as it is called) are two antagonistic civilizations that are precipitously headed for a war. The last spaceship of Terrans has departed Mars, but before it reaches its interplanetary course it is intercepted by Martian military. The Martians believe that on board of the spaceship are three saboteurs that destroyed one of their major cities. Whether this is in fact the case and how this may influence the Terran journey home is the principle plotline of this story.The story is very well crafted, and it has all the elements of classic sci-fi genre: interplanetary travel, clash of civilizations, and fantastic advanced technology that is at the crux of the plot development. The story can also be viewed through the prism of the Cold War, as two radically different civilizations are vying for supremacy and are willing to use underhanded tactics to gain an upper hand in future negotiations. The plotline holds well together, and provides enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. This is a good, solid sci-fi story that will be appreciated by all fans of this genre.** The Defenders **This is a short Philip K. Dick story that takes place in a not too distant future where the world has been devastated by the almost total destruction wreaked on by the World War III. The war between the Soviet Union on one hand and the United states on the other has been going on for years, and most of the Earth's surface has been totally destroyed. Humans have been forced to live in artificial cities that are buried deep underground, far away from the lethal radiation that has engulfed all of the surface. Far from wanting to end the war, however, the warring parties have developed armies of humanoid robots that can withstand the conditions on the surface and have been waging the war as proxies.This story has many of the quintessential Philip K. Dick themes: preoccupation with nuclear war, obtuse functioning of the military, and humanoid robots that develop conscience that is not just a mare extension of the conscience of their creators. On the other hand, unlike many of his other stories, this one has a hopeful and a positive outlook. Also, the writing is well-crafted and the narrative relatively straightforward, which make this one of the more accessible of Philip K. Dick's stories.** The Gun **A spaceship approaches an alien plant. The planet seems to have been completely destroyed in a nuclear holocaust, with no visible signs of life. Unexpectedly, an enormous gun shells the spaceship with nuclear warheads, damaging it and forcing it to descend on the planet for the repairs. There they discover the secret behind the gun and the treasure that it was designed to protect.This short story is quintessential Philip K. Dick, with very matter-of-fact sentences, abrupt changes of action, and themes of nuclear war, robots, and military. The ambiguity of not knowing the identity of the people on the spaceship and the name of the planet adds to the poignancy of the underlying message. This is certainly an interesting and thought-provoking story that is easy to read. All sci-fi fans will surely enjoy it.** The Skull **This is one of my favorite PKD stories. Its narrative is very tight, without any loose ends or underdeveloped plot advances. The characters are minimalistic, but fully three dimensional and authentic. This is particularly true of the main protagonist. This story has many similarities with \\"Twelve Monkeys\\", \\"Back to the Future\\" and the \\"Terminator\\" series, but it is still a very unique take on time travel.Another one of the recurring PKD themes that features in this short story is that of a police state and the ways it crushes individuals. This suppressive force turns out to be an indispensible part of the plotline, and without it this story would make little sense.Whether you are a PKD fan or just enjoy short sci-fi works you will enjoy this unique story.** The Eyes Have It **This whimsical short story is the shortest one in the collection and could not easily stand on its own. PKD takes a certain feature of the language and develops it into a full-blown conspiracy theory. He still manages to do this with considerable skill and narrative ingenuity, so this ultra-short story is definitely worth reading.** Second Variety **This is a short Philip K. Dick story that takes place in a not too distant future where the world has been devastated by the almost total destruction wreaked on by the World War III. The war between the Soviet Union on one hand and the United states on the other has been going on for years, and Soviets have managed to gain control of much of the Earth's surface, while Americans had been forced into an exile on the Moon. Americans have resorted to guerrilla warfare, with small contingents operating deep within the enemy-occupied territory. As a desperate measure, they have also constructed extremely efficient killer robots that can operate on their own and are capable of repairing themselves and improving on their own design. It is this last feature that will eventually come to haunt them, and will take the whole course of the war into an unexpected and sinister direction.This is a sinister and thought-provoking story. The writing is well crafted and the narrative is extremely well constructed, virtually without any gaps or loose ends. In terms of the seamlessness of style and substance, as well as the sheer narrative technique, this is one of the best of Philip K. Dick's stories. If you are new to this genius of sci-fi then this would be one of the best ways of getting introduced to his writing. The story has been used as a basis for the movie \\"Screamers\\", and it is also possible to discern certain themes that have parallels with the latest \\"Battlestar Galactica.\\"** The Variable Man **In the middle of the twenty-second century Terra (a.k.a. Earth) has expanded its influence throughout the Solar System, but a vast, yet weak, empire rules the rest of the Galaxy. Terrans have been at war with this empire for generations, and have never been in a position to prevail over their adversaries. However, the invention of a new weapon - a faster-than-light bomb - may finally shift the balance of power in their favor. Unfortunately, due to an accident with time-travel, a man form the twentieth century ends up in their midst, and his very existence seems to be the cause of uncertainty for the sophisticated prediction computers on which the Terran military establishment relies in planning of their attack. The visitor from the past is thus the variable man - a man whose very existence undermines brings a lot of indeterminism to the military plans.This longish story or a short novella is one of the finest examples of PKD's sci-fi writing skills.** Mr. Sapceship **The story is steeped in the mid-twentieth century mindset that perceived the rise of the industrial-military complex as the greatest threat to the civilization, the state of war seemed like an inescapable human destiny, and the backdrop of the cold war was constantly on peoples minds. PKD uses all of these themes skillfully to weave an original and entertaining story. Towards the end of the story he also employs some pseudo-religious musings, which are also very familiar to his readers. Overall, this is a well-crafted story, but it's nothing spectacular. Modern sci-fi fans are already inured to the idea of combining biological and mechanical, as the viewers of the recent Battlestar Galactica TV series can attest.** Piper in the Woods **This is one of the finer PKD stories, with well-developed characters, smoothly flowing plot, and imaginative and unique developments. PKD's stories can sometimes feature rough transitions and endings, but this is not the case with this story. The themes that are explored are very interesting and are amongst some of PKD's most enduring fascination: personal identity and what it means to be human. This story also has a deeper allegorical message, which intertwines smoothly with the plotline.In my opinion this is what a solid sci-fi story should look like. I would strongly recommend it.**** Conclusion ****This collection of short story is the finest examples of PKD's early sci-fi writing skills. Most stories are well developed; although from the vantage point of today's sci-fi there are many loose ends and nave plot developments. The stories have the charm of vintage sci-fi, all with almost laughably simpleminded view of the future technology (vidphones are poor man's versions of iPhones) and *very* inaccurate presentation of science. This stories have many of the quintessential Philip K. Dick themes: preoccupation with nuclear war, obtuse functioning of the military, humanoid robots that develop conscience that is not just a mare extension of the conscience of their creators, people who are not quite human, and, of course, space travel, although this is just a minor narrative-setting device. I am also fascinated with PKD's ideas about religion. This is usually a very hard subject to do right, especially in science fiction. PKD manages at the same time to present his own unique views and take religion seriously.If you are looking for a polished and technologically sophisticated stories than you will be very disappointed. On the other hand, if you are tired of all the predictable and mechanistic stories that you can read today, and enjoy raw, rough, ideas that aim for immediate impact, then you will definitely enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"The Best of Philip K.

The research, attention to detail and the scholarship that combined to produce this work are beyond measure.For any serious Civil War buff this book is a &quot;must&quot;. There is no area relating to the High Command of either North or South that is not covered in exquisite detail. It contains not only the biographical notes for virtually every major and minor character on both sides, it lists the ranks, date of rank and assignments. Reads like an Officer's Personnel Record, complete with photographs of individuals where available. It is particularly useful in bringing into clear focus the organizational structure, badges of rank and the different departments making up the respective armies.This is an absolutely invaluable tool for anyone interested in an in-depth source for reference to go hand-in-hand with careful study of the major works on Civil War battles and campaigns.It should certainly be found on the shelves of any college or university library."},{"Title":"Civil War High Commands","review":"The Eichers, et al, have done Civil War buffs a great service with this fabulous piece of research. If you are looking for info on military and/or civilian leaders, this is the best single source yet published. Thanks guys!"},{"Title":"Civil War High Commands","review":"In the forward, John Y. Simon, states this is not \\"a book to curl up with on a cold winter night\\" or a book that you would \\"take to the beach\\". He is correct, this is not a book that you will sit down and read, unless you normally read baseball encyclopedias. This book is a feast of facts, statistics and information relating to the American Civil War.How many men did New York supply when Lincoln asked for 75,000 men in 1861? There is a multiple page table with the answer, by state by levy for the USA and CSA. When was Ebenezer Dumont born? What is his military record? When did he die and where is he buried? If you are still reading, you may want to consider buying this book.The first hundred pages is information about the nation, political structure and the military forces. This is followed by 600 pages of biographies of general and flag offices and \\"Might-Have-Beens'. The answers to the questions on Ebenezer Dumont are in this section. The next 100 pages, details grades and rank for general and flag level officers. This section has tables with date of rank, nomination, confirmation and termination for each. A second table lists all these officers by grade by date of rank. Need to know who was the CSA's senior Brigadier General in 1865? After finding that answer, go back to the biographies to see what he did during the war. The next hundred pages cover the command structure for both sides. Departments were vital during the war. Commanders in one department constantly looked to other departments for support. More often than not, the other department commander was busy with his own problems. This section will allow you to check the department history, next time you try to understand why J.E. Johnston could not get Forrest to attack Sherman's supply lines in 1864. Ending the book is about seventy pages of important dates, a good bibliography and a name index. Package all this information on a large format nicely bound book and you have a feast for detail people.People whose knowledge of the war, I respect, say the information is accurate. I know this is a very hansom book, well presented that is great fun for the serious student of the American Civil War. If you qualify as a \\"serious student\\" and a \\"detail person\\", this is a book you should enjoy."},{"Title":"Civil War High Commands","review":"The best single-volume reference on Civil War personnel ever! Period.However, for the sake of completeness, two small factual errors should be noted. On page 771, in the list of retired Commodores, the name of Charles W. Pickering should be included, and on page 786, in the list of active duty Commodores, John S. Chauncey should be omitted. Chauncey retired as a Captain on December 21, 1861, and was promoted to Commodore on the retired list on April 4, 1867 (his date of retirement as shown on pp. 770 & 786 are probably typographical errors).I highly recommend this work, and find it to be easily worth twice it's asking reail price.My thanks to the authors for providing this indispensable reference tool to the research community.Ken McCanliss(KMcCanliss@webtv.net)"},{"Title":"The Craft of Editing: A Guide for Managers, Scientists, and Engineers","review":"I am an engineer and writer.

This was a battle John's loved ones could not fight for him. This was John's war; all others had to take a supporting role.John Head's life is literally an open book in STANDING IN THE SHADOWS. In order to help African-American men-and those who love them-win the fight against depression, John Head reveals his revelations, struggles, failures, successes, and strategies for dealing with depression.As I read STANDING IN THE SHADOWS, I could see how men suffering from depression could identify with John's struggles and hopefully seek help. As the wife of a diagnosed manic-depressive Black man, I could identify with the stories of John's family struggles. At times, Mr. Head became preachy on issues such as the role that racism plays in depression in African-American men and the stigma many Blacks have against admitting and treating mental illnesses, but otherwise this is an excellent book that is very informative and personable.Reviewed by Deatri King-Beyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Standing In the Shadows: Understanding and Overcoming Depression in Black Men","review":"First you gotto get over the Black Power talk and the fact that all of the author's heroes are black.

As it is, my first year of teaching in 1993 included four preps: English 10 Honors, English 9, newspaper, and yearbook. (Anybody want to say &quot;Year of Insanity&quot;?) While I did survive, I struggled that year because the resources for publication advisers are very few. Starting almost from scratch and given very little in support, I ended up putting together my own bound journalism resource book, which is similar in many ways to Osborn's work. But the &quot;Survival Guide&quot; I bought last year is still worthwhile for me to have on hand because it has a number of &quot;cool&quot; sheets that can be photocopied. (Kudos for the wire spine that make turning pages and laying them on the photocopier simple!)

You definetly have to check this volume out...Fruits Basket 9 has chapters 49-53, with new charecters introduced! (Finally!)Chapter 49 (Machi and Kakeru)- It's summer vacation and Yuki is hard at work. He goes to school to do some work as the upcoming student body president. We meet two of the four student council memebers, Machi Kuragi and Kakeru Manabe. That was the main theme in the chapter, but I think something of importance is shown in Tohru, who actually YELLS at Yuki and Kyo to stop fighting! (swinging around a hot iron no less) This is the first time she truly has used some force to stop the two from fighting. I found it significant myself.Chapter 50 (Arisa and Kureno)- Wow! 3 new charecters within 2 chapters! Awesome isn't it? In the ever so special chapter 50, we meet Kureno, Arisas now love interest. I don't want to give too much away about him. There is a lot of stuff you have to learn about this guy. It becomes clear if you read spoilers too much. I'll just tell you that he is the Tohru-like person Arisa was talking about before in volume 8. She met him at the convienience store where she works and couldn't stop thinking about him. And when she saw him again she grabbed (literally) at the chance to talk to him again. They went on a little date for lunch. But what was Kureno doing with Akito at the end of this chapter?Chapter 51 (Saki Hanajimas past)- We finally find out about Sakis sad past. Apparently, people at school treated her as a witch. She started to wear black after nearly killing a classmate that made her life miserable. The torture only got worse. It got so bad, her family moved and she transfered to another school, where she met Tohru and Arisa. As much as she didn't want to, she couldn't help but befriend the two. But then some students find out about her past. Hanajima tries to break off the friendship, but can't resist Tohru. Of course we know she did get control of her power, and is still the best of friends with Tohru. :DChapter 52 (Kazuma and Kyos dad)-Kyo and Tohru visit Kazuma at his home. There are many Kyoru moments here. But there are three major things of significance could be seen in this chapter. 1) Kyos maturity. He looks as if he is a whole foot (if not more) taller than Tohru! He is also becoming kinder to Tohru and others. This is a huge difference from the angry Kyo we saw at the start of the series. 2) Kyos dad. Of course this is a big thing. We learn that he hates Kyo, calls him an it, a monster, and that Kazuma is truly the only fatherly figure out there for tohru. We also learn from this part about Kyo bieng locked away after graduation. That is huge. HUGE! 3) Kazumas flashback. Kazumas flashback only helps confirm a theory that Kyo killed Kyoko. If you think about the circumstances, and the timeline, it seems almost obvious.Chapter 53 (Rin and the Red Cap)-Yuki starts talking to Tohru about the red cap she says is precious to her. She tells her part of the story/ He is about to tell her his part of the story, and more importantly, who the red cap boy is. But then, right when Yuki is getting to the good part, the wind breaks the window in the room. Scene change to Shigure downstairs, where he meets Rin outside. Rin is there for an obvious reason, that only becomes obvious later on ;) this situation is resolved in first chapter of the next book. We end the book with the red cap boys identity bieng revealed, and Rin seducing Shigure. (Don't worry, like I said it will be resolved)And that's it! There is also this cute bonus chapter at the end. Everyone beware the Rain Shelter of Terror!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 9","review":"Now with summer vacation here the Sohma house is relaxed and the occupants are free to do whatever they want...all except for Yuki, who must spend his days with the student council.

Little does she know the connection this enigmatic man has to some very close friends of hers.Hanajima's past and true powers are revealed further, plus the connection that she shares with Uotani and Tohru. Also a lunch date at Kyo's Master's house unearths surprises as the host suddenly has to depart for a meeting with Kyo's real father. Some of the plans for Kyo's future are revealed.Momitchi Sohma invites everyone to a vacation retreat. A baseball cap, one of Tohru's prized possessions, comes into question from Yuki. Apparently, when she was a child, Tohru met a young boy who helped her and left behind his hat. What connection does this have to the Sohma family? And at the end, a surprise guest shows up, another Sohma, but who is this mysterious young woman, and why is she being so affectionate with Shigure?Hmmm... prediction, naturally it's obvious but what the heck, I'll say it.

A little bit of romance... for Arisa! She has one fateful meeting with a young man at the grocery store...and then we find out he's a Sohma! (But why is he so close to Akito?...)3. A little bit of mystery... So what does the mysterious Rin Sohma want, anyway? And what's going on between her and Shigure?4. A little bit of fun-ness... Tohruyukikyo and momijiharu visit a haunted house... Haru tells an extremely strange story about the relationship between one of the ghosts and it's mother in order to calm Tohru down. (I love him! Where does he come up with all this stuff?)5. A little bit of not fun-ness... we get to meet Kyo's biological dad (I'm pretty sure it's in this volume) He's a lot like Kyo- only without any of the redeeming qualities. It made me cringe to see how much hatred he has for his son- uck... :-(6. A LOT of Hanajima... We learn the story of how Hana-chan becomes friends with Arisa and Tohru. (The only thing I have to say about this story is, I didn't think that there were any supportive, functional families in Fruits Basket- glad to know that Hana-chan's got one!)Anyway, if you are a FB fan, please buy this!

When the anime was nearing its end, the manga was far from finished; so, the anime version includes an ending section that isn't part of the manga. Since I was already familiar with the anime before I started reading the manga, I was very curious to read the remaining manga volumes to see how the story progressed beyond the anime series.In this volume, Yuki has been elected as student council president, and we get to meet two new characters (Machi and Kakeru) who are also part of the student council. At this point, Yuki isn't sure how well he'll be able to work with the others on the council. Also in this volume, Uo meets Kureno Sohma, who doesn't tell her that he's a Sohma (Kureno turns into a rooster when he's hugged by a member of the opposite sex). Uo falls in love with Kureno, but nothing really progresses in the way of a relationship at this point. The reader also learns about Hana's past. We get to see Kyo's father, and how Kazuma (Kyo's teacher who appeared in an earlier volume of the manga) is more of a father to Kyo than his own father is. At the end of the volume, we meet the final member of the Sohma family... Rin Sohma (she turns into a horse when she's hugged by a member of the opposite sex).By the time I finished reading this volume, I was very pleased with how the story was progressing. I definitely wanted to continue reading more volumes and see how the story would continue to develop.

The Goth of the two reveals her struggle to be accepted by others, including her skirmishs at school which led to rumors that she kills others because they assume that she is a witch.I could personally identify with the two friends, which is a little scary.Overall, if character development is your thing, purchase it used from a good seller."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 9","review":"Tohru hasn't told Kyo that she liked him yet, but what happens to her best friends, Uo-chan and Hana-chan?

Anyone who is a Fruits Basket fan will definitely get this book and many others."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 9","review":"i waited for 3 weeks to get this book from amazon.com because my package was lost in transit.

Walton's resonant voice recalls at times August Kleinzahler's, Wallace Stevens', and A.R. Ammons', but is maturely individual as well. Whether he pays homage to Etta James, draws in the natural rhythms of Maine, or evokes characters from a Midwestern night shift, the poet guides his material (and indeed this reader) where it is already inclined to go, namely towards the spirit of survival as it runs a footrace with the ordinary and extraordinary elements of life. Walton delicately but deliberately shapes a kind of comfort out of the discomfort of mortality. To me, it is a book about quiet resilience, and Walton deftly fingers creative production as a means both to make sense of and form that stunning characteristic."},{"Title":"Cricket Weather","review":"Cricket Weather is a collection of poems and prints of the specific. The poems range in subject from music to nature to the study of the human mind, each full of details that engage the reader. Walton's sense of timing and sound in the lines of his poetry is clever and concise. This is a small book of carefully constructed poems that the reader can enjoy on the first read, or with more study, can understand the layers of their construction. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"Anyone who is going to Acadia National Park should have a copy of this well-written book. It gives great details of countless trips, whether hiking, biking, kayaking or canoeing- you won't get lost, you'll know exactly what to look for, and you'll enjoy the Monkmans' beautiful descriptions while you're at it. The trips are labeled as to their difficulty, how long they might take, etc. Don't go without it!"},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"I've used this book on a couple of trips to Acadia. It's best feature is the detailed pull-out map in the back which shows all the major hiking trails. This is a great book to study BEFORE your trip. It has very detailed descriptions of hiking and biking trails and paddling and sea kayaking trips. It's great to pick out the activities you want to do, but this detailed nature makes it less useful on the trail though. It's too wordy and too bulky. (Take the map with you though!) It would be better if it had more pictures of the different areas. It's also missing mini-maps of each hiking or biking trail. Instead, you're left to pull out the map and try to follow along based on their descriptions. It would be great if this book were split into two, one for hiking and biking and one for paddling and sea kayaking, each in color with more pictures and terrain maps. Until then, there's still a lot of great info in this edition."},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"I agree with the previous reviews- this is the only book you'll need to have when going to Acadia National Park, and you'd be missing something great if you didn't have it. Even if you are only a beginner, you'll enjoy reading about the more advanced trips as well as the easy ones because the information is so well presented. The authors are also excellent nature photographers, so the readers are able to see the described trails and scenery as if they were looking through the lense of a camera- everthing is so beautifully presented. The book gives a lot of material that could be cut, dried, and boring, but it is anything but. Do yourself a favor, and buy this book before setting out - you'll enjoy your adventure so much more."},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"So thorough, helpful, and attractive is this volume that I should think the Monkmans have eliminated the need for any similar Acadia guidebooks for years to come. What elevates this particular effort above others in the genre is the top-notch photography which accompanies the text (which is hardly a surprise given the Monkmans' tireless EcoPhotography work in the northeast) and the handy hiking &amp; biking map ensconced in the back. Admirable, too, is the text's obvious effort to be more than a mere assemblage of practical information and trail descriptions: the recreational advice is complemented by revealing sidebars and park history, reflecting the authors' commitment to the spirit of Acadia and the natural world. I can't imagine, in other words, that there's a better guide to tuck in the pannier or the backpack for your next trip to this great park!"},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"I love this book and refer to it often when I feel the need to take an outdoor adventure in Acadia. While it aptly describes every trail in the park and comes with an impressive 4 color map , what sets this guide apart is its descriptive narrative of park features. It's sidebars and little factoids about the area's history, flora, and fauna give the reader a deeper understanding of the place he or she is hiking, biking, or paddling through. It makes for much more interesting reading than the typical &quot;turn left at the trail junction.&quot; Visitors new to the area will also appreciate the book's listings of campgrounds, museums, gardens, whale and puffin watching tours, etc. Tons of great info packed into a reasonable size!"},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"This book does offer lots of informative descriptions of many hiking trails, bike rides, and paddling trips in Acadia. It describes not only selected carriage roads, but also some often-overlooked fire roads and other dirt roads. And the map which comes with it is, like all AMC maps, outstanding; it is even printed on waterproof, tear-proof tyvek. However, I would like to point out quite a few flaws of this book:1) The book is overly large to carry with you on a hike2) Confusing verbal descriptions of trail locations can be difficult to locate on the included map. Ideally, each trip should contain a thumbnail map, or at least be coded to the central map.3) Long verbal descriptions should be condensed into a cue sheet for each trip. Although the park is well marked, presumably the point of buying the book is to follow a route suggested by the author.4) A little more subjectivity wouldn't hurt. The book has lots of information but could use some more opinion. Again, the point of buying a book is to get a viewpoint from an &quot;expert.&quot;5) The book is by no means &quot;comprehensive&quot;. &quot;Comprehensive&quot; means &quot;every trail in the park.&quot; This book is selective, not comprehensive."},{"Title":"Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling","review":"This book gives you all you need to know about travelling to Acadia.

It is the story of a girl who becomes obssessed with owning a pair of beautiful red dancing shoes with long silk ribbons. Her grandmother refuses to buy them, claiming they are not practical. Yet she thinks of nothing else and saves up all her money, until finally they are hers. However, the girl soon finds out the consequences of possessing the red shoes. The ending of the story has changed from the original---which was the girl amputated her feet to get the shoes off. The ending of this version is more suitable for younger readers.

This is truly a briliant theory. The Mars-Earth wars had to have happened."},{"Title":"Catastrophism and the Old Testament: The Mars- Earth conflicts","review":"While I am still in the process of reading this book I think Patten and his associates have produced another interesting and thought-provoking alternative framework for interpreting the geological and cultural history, and pre-history, of the Earth going beyond the exclusive choices of \\"Uniformitarian-Evolutionist\\" versus \\"Fiat Creationist\\" alternatives. Their builds on the works of Immanuel Velikovsky in taking Biblical and extra-biblical native (and other ancient) oral and written traditions seriously. Nice to shake the cages of scientific orthodoxy once in a while - and also nice to challenge \\"fiat creationist\\" conceptions with alternative explanations of the same events - the Flood, the Ten Plagues of Egypt, the \\"Long Day\\" of Joshua, among several others - that still respect the Biblical accounts as historically accurate and that do not exclude the possibility of God actively ruling in both natural and political history. The planetary catastrophist hypothesis also seeks to explain the traditions and sagas of non-Judeo-Christian civilizations - such as the siege of ancient Troy, among other things. Also explains the rise (and subsequent decline) of the worship of the god Mars in various cultures of the catastrophic period."},{"Title":"Catastrophism and the Old Testament: The Mars- Earth conflicts","review":"I found the book to be everything I expected. It is a serious study in this area of Bible study. I have been working in a parallel fashion with his previous work without knowing it. In fact I am having to refer specifically to his name often to avoid the charge of plagiarism. I have been writing on correct dating of the kings' list of Judah and Israel and using the catastrophes as given in 2nd Kings and Isaiah to get that period right while supplying interesting insights. I knew of Mr. Patten and his work through studies with \\"Redshift\\", a computer program on dating that is a junior version of the one used at the Jet Propulsion Lab. When I ran into the work by Mr. Patten on the internet I was very excited to find someone else working in this area. His writing on liquid gyroscopes has been particularly inspiring and helpful to me and my imagination when it comes to the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\". I have relied on his work to learn about the physics and astronomy needed for a complete work while at the same time incorporating the reign of kings with Biblical description of events that could only be real if we allow ourselves some imagination. Using imagination in this instance is not excusing fairy tales. It is requiring the mind to expand to assimilate these new but correct explanations for so many things in this area of prophecy where objectivity takes place of that imagination. I found that the dating of the period from 747 BC to 701 BC is marked by the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Although history before the 8th century is pot marked with global catastrophe, I believe they canceled each other out until the period of 794 to 701 BC. My thesis is that there were six inside passes from fall equinox of 794 to 714 BC and a final outside pass by Mars in 701 BC, which Mr. Patten does a super job on. He used a difficult system to move time backwards to March of 701 BC where I use the Redshift program. I found that the last big event occurred a midnight March 28th. His dating of the reign of Hezekiah is flawed by accepting Courville and Thieles's dating that is wrong. 2nd Kings 18 states emphatically that Hezekiah was in his sixth year (722 BC) when Samaria fell to Sargon and that there were TWO invasions of Sennacherib, one in 714 BC and the last in March of 701 BC. Thank you very much for the book and it is in wonderful condition. I look forward to meeting Mr. Patten and comparing our viewpoints but I already know that my work hinges on the astrophysics and a willingness to study the prophets with an open mind that allows for explanation of the catastrophic disruption of natural order, not an act of \\"mother nature\\" who has come to be worshiped in later years more than God, who developed and introduced \\"natural law\\" or \\"natural order\\", not some freakish unknown spirit of \\"mother nature\\" out there, \\"mother nature\\" ready to pounce upon us.

I found it fascinating and mostly plausible. Serious students of the Bible should read this book."},{"Title":"Catastrophism and the Old Testament: The Mars- Earth conflicts","review":"Patten's obviously meticulously researched and documented works are stunning. His style of writing is pondering and lacks the zip of the pop culture, but his theories and the subsesequent content is the freshest, most probably of any I've heard, and sure does explain a lot of what we could only shrug about before. With another good writer or editor and a reprinting I think Patten's two primary books could really shake up the status quo. Like he said, the evidence is not as much found in looking down, but up. I imagine our scientists could learn much more if they could think outside the box they've put themselves into. I would suggest that readers of his stuff take it slow and easy...try to understand before breezing on to the next topic...and I'd say the best laughing is done by those who laugh last."},{"Title":"Catastrophism and the Old Testament: The Mars- Earth conflicts","review":"The review of Patten's Catatrophism and the Old testament by The Reader was not really convincing. He seems to dismiss Patten for the same reason he dismisses Velikovsky, but offers no reason for either. The Reader wrote his review in 1997. Everything I have read about catastrophism in science for the past ten years (2007) has only confirmed the essentials of Patten's thesis. The Reader wants to simply laugh off Patten, but I think he is overly sensitive.Patten's is a real explanation of causes and relations, which explanatory power is the main criterion you want in a scientifically-satisfactory explanation, which he explains in both his books.Patten as a catastrophic scientist is convincing in both his former and latter works: Ice Epoch and Old Testament. His theological conclusions in Catatrophism in the Old Testament I think, are over extended. Some are plausible - crustal skid in Joshua's long day, could be; the destruction of Sennacherib's army by a discharge of electricity from Mars, could be- but others seem to be incredulous to my mind.Both of Patten's books are strictly scientific in the presentation of the data. Patten's thesis is the most complete theory of catatrophism I have ever read. Nearly all the discoveries I have encountered to date confirm the essential parts of his scientific work, however I would flag his limitations at the point using a scientific explanation to prove theological conclusions.They may or may not be causally related in some cases, but it is up to the reader to accept that by faith, not the writer to assert it dogmatically. Both of Patten's works are highly readable and thought provoking, as opposed to laughter provoking. I recommend them both unreservedly for serious study and comparison with the observations."},{"Title":"Catastrophism and the Old Testament: The Mars- Earth conflicts","review":"Donald Patten has continued in the proud tradition of Immanuel Velikovsky: producing a document which is indicative of the author's lack of scientific literacy. This book contains sweeping re-interpretations of the history of the human race. In this book Donald Patten attempts to reach the unusual goal of disproving evolution and creation simultaneously. If you look no where else, that goal is achieved. In this book every event in the Old Testament, from the Tower of Babel to David's victory over the armies of Sennecherib, are the result of the tidal forces created by Earth and Mars closely passing each other in their orbits. It also contains the &quot;truth&quot; about the formation of the solar system. Instead of the erroneous theory about coalescing interstellar dust and hydrogen gas forming the sun and planets, we are presented with the revelation that our sun wandered throughout the galaxy and &quot;collected&quot; the planets from other stars. When enough planets were obtained in this manner, our sun had an &quot;ignition event&quot; and became the bright star we now see. Patten has similar insightful knowledge about Mars. He has determined that Mars once existed with another planet which he designates as &quot;Astra&quot; These two worlds rotated about each other like a binary star system. Through an unidentified cataclysm Astra exploded about 2700 years ago and formed the asteroid belt which now exists between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. A large chunk the the exploded Astra struck Mars and caused its orbit to become very eccentric. This eccentricity created a orbital relationship between Earth and Mars which he designates the &quot;catastrophic era&quot; that lasted about 600 years. One outstading feature of this era is that Mars would approach to within 10,000 miles of Earth every 52 years. The results of such a truly catastrophic approach are all of the events we see recorded in the Old Testament. The Tower of Babel was destroyed by lightning exchanges between the two planets, Noah's flood was caused by tidal surges of the worlds oceans created by the gravimetric mass of Mars, all of the plagues faced by Egypt were caused by this close approach, Sennecherib was destroyed because his army had metal swords which acted as lightning rods, and Joshua's long day was because the Earth stopped rotating on its axis for a period of time. Patten also has a solution for why wooly mammoths have been found frozen in the arctic region. It is his contention that Mars had a third moon at one time. He calls this moon &quot;Glacis&quot; because it was composed entirely of frozen water. On one of the close approaches of Mars to Earth, this &quot;moon&quot; passed within the Roche Limit and exploded. The vast quantity of ice crystals from this event were &quot;vortexed&quot; down the north and south poles. The resulting rain of -300 degree celcius ice flash froze everything in its path. This book will present a person with numerous &quot;scientific&quot; proofs for this event. The one which caused me to roll on the floor in laughter was found in Jonathan Swifts' &quot;Gullivers' Travels&quot;. When Gulliver found himself in the land of Laputa, the astronomers there told him that Mars had two moons in a nearly circular orbit. According to Patten the only way Jonathan Swift would have been aware of such a fact is that he must have read an account of someone who witnessed the Mars-Earth close encounter. After about 600 years of these catastrophic encounters Mars settled back into the orbit it had originally and all has been well with the solar system since. This book is interesting if for no other reason other than the ridiculous claims it contains. There is much entertainment value in this book. I would recommend keeping a copy in a home library for use whenever a good laugh is needed."},{"Title":"Biblical geography and history","review":"I found this riveting reading but difficult to follow without a map in hand.

After going through all the difficulties in making a selection from the many texts available to him, Huntington settles on analysing the short stories in the 1970 compilation, 'The SF Hall of Fame'. Using these as a representative sample, he runs through them with clear analyses of their ideologies.Probably more influenced by Freud than he might like to admit, Huntington reveals the repressed anxieties of the sf movement of this period, analysing the motivations for the intertia that would eventually push it out of time and into the radical 1960s. But ideological analysis is never kind, and he begins with something of an apology to those who idealise the American Golden Age as something of an idealistic time of the genre. For the contradictions in these stories are those of the American male of the period itself. Coming to terms with their adolescence, with fantasies of power, with their problems with women, sf is not so much an escapist genre as a sublimation of social conflict.While it is not as pretty picture as those deep within the sf field might like to see in print, Huntington's extraordinary clarity and sociological commitment to the period at hand reveals some gems of insight. For instance, the way in which the technocracy and meritocracy of the 1950s and 60s is backed up by an ideology of autonomisation. In other words, the way in which reason for reason's sake becomes an excuse to justify images and behaviour that are often sadistic, sometimes racist and sexist. Yet this is not a simple ideological denunciation. For Huntington is always working from a historical, dialectical method that will return these problems to the social issues of the time. Far from being critical of sf authors, he will embed them in the problematic ideas of the long American 1950s.This is an awesome analysis, and anyone even thinking of writing on the period or sf really should get a hold of this book. In this humble reviewers opinion, it sits with Darko Suvin's Metamorphosis, Mark Rose's Alien Encounters and a couple of other books I most likely haven't read yet as one of the great stuctural analyses of sf. Oh, and his book on H.G, Wells is fantastic too."},{"Title":"Rationalizing Genius: Ideological Strategies in the American Science Fiction Short Story","review":"This is a very detailed look at certain aspects of SF - specifically, its 'ideology', including the idea of genius, the (perceived) danger of women, and the genre's love for aliens, robots and monsters. The age of the stories ranges from the earliest SF to the 1960s, which limits the scope of the book somewhat since great changes have occurred in the genre since 1970.The quality of the writing is far from inspiring, but the case it argues is sound and rather persuasive.

Well crafted political essay mixed in as well, not so kind to the Labour party. Masterfull detail and research, again more super human characters but very sympathetic, almost wish that everybody could have come out of it unscathed. Again once started almost impossible to stop reading."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I've read all of Frederick Forsyth's novels, most of them more than once, and this is far and away the best he's ever done.The plot is very plausible, remember it was written during the Cold War confrontation between Thatcher and Reagan on the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other.The smuggling a nuclear device into the UK with the intention of exploding it near a nuclear arms base makes for a very intricate series of events.The false-flag recruitment, and the subsequent chase, from London to South Africa, and back to London, with the professional \\"Shadowers\\" team, is gripping.The car and motorbike chase for the Soviet spy throughout England, all of it hingeing on a traffic jam, is one of the best I've ever read, even better than most scenes in movies.Most of all, Forsyth's ability to bring all the threads of his novel together at the end, is unparalleled.Thank you, Mr. Forsyth !"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"It's the best spy novel I've ever come accross. The best till date. The unexpected twists and turns make even the next line unpredictable and you must read it to believe it. The facts that he supplies always make one think as if the plot was real. In short a must read for all Forsyth lovers. And if you are goung to read it for the first time I can't help envying the great time that you will have."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"The Fourth Protocol is a superb Cold War spy story, set in the mid-1980s at the the height of the Cold War. Without giving anything away, the story is set in Britain. The \\"Hard Left\\" has been plotting for decades to effect a legal takeover of the Labour Party. Elements within the Soviet government would like to assist the Hard Left in order to bring about, through process of law, a Communist, pro-Soviet Government in Britain. Therein lies a fascinating and plausible tale of espionage and the stakes could not be higher.The thing that distinguishes this particular story is its authenticity and plausibility. As always, author Forsyth has meticulously researched every detail in this novel. Everything from the bureaucratic infighting within MI-5 to the details of the organization of the KGB and Soviet government, are simply correct. Nothing in this story strains the readers credulity. This detailed novel is one of those page-turners that many readers will read multiple times, each time gleaning and appreciating additional details of the intricate plot.This is one of Forsyth's many winners. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"The novel begins with a British informant to Russia who exposes weaknesses in England. The protagonist, a British special operations detective, investigates the death of a Russian infiltrator. His mission is to thwart a Russian coup to subvert the British parliament towards Marxism, by electing a sympathetic to the Left president. This will of course serve to weaken Europe and strengthen Russia. The tide is already moving toward socialism, and the arms race is the answer. There are many plants, but ultimately, the hunt is for the top dog, Russian infiltrator; and the Brits have their own, unconventional spy.Forsyth keeps a pace that draws the reader in. A fascinating read of detective work.True to life here in America; we have(had) avowed Marxists working under the executive.God blessScott"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"This book is set in Britain, South Africa and Russia in the 1980s. Unlike other agent stories, which I had tried in the past, the necessary background information for this intelligent plot is given in a compact way. Thus the book appears to be well researched and it is kept both exciting and understandable. Several story lines are intertwined in a neat way which helps to keep the suspense.I had come upon this book after reading The Day of the Jackal (also by Forsyth) which I had experienced as similarly well researched and exciting. Thus this was my second book by Forsyth and I look forward to try out some more in the future."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I'm reading my Freddie Forsyth novels in sequence. This is his fifth thriller, and it maintains the even standard of excellence he established with his first and seminal work The Day of the Jackal.Like Forsyth's other novels, The Fourth Protocol really seizes your attention, and like the other novels again, it does so gradually, like the slow crushing motion of a car compressor. The technique is the same. It is the detail that creates the clear images and the authenticity, and really you are inside what seems like a terrifying documentary. After this decade's developments in international terrorism one realises how far ahead of the game Forsyth is here with his portable nuclear plot.What really works for him, as he delves into the inter-related layers of the secret services in both the UK and Russia, is how the reader is drawn to speculate about who is on our side and who is not. What are the key characters' motives and loyalties? The other technique, which is typically Forsyth, is the amazing number of minor variables that all have a seemingly telling impact on the possible outcome of the plot. The suspense ratchets up and it's beautifully resolved.This novel lacks a little of the crunch and thud of one or two others, but the spell is woven just as well. You will the central character, Preston, to win. It may be the Fourth Protocol but it is Forsyth's Fifth Success. It falls short only in one regard, and that is the lack of sub-plots to add personal depth to the central characters. Again, this one is female-'lite'. It's a minor quibble for being so well entertained but women read thrillers too! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I could not put this book down.

The action never lets up. Awesome,well crafted, beautiful"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"By sheer coincidence I started this book just before the Trade Tower disaster and finished it a few days after it. So it started out as a novel of international espionage between super powers but ended as a novel of terrorism by a handful of crazed individuals infiltrating a peace loving civilized country. And the resolution of the threat in the novel is a significant insight into the possible resolution of the current Arab terrorism.As are John Forsythe's other books, the novel is beautifully detailed but at the same time fast paced."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I read this book on night shift. Forsyth takes us from Scotland to Russia and to England in this thriller/spy novel. This is extremely gripping and masterly written. Thoroughly enjoyable! The film version is not a patch on the book."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"This is not Forsyth's best book, but it's not too much of a dropoff from The Day of the Jackal. The Soviets have a plot that will lead England to be a socialist ally, and it is up to a fairly minor British civil servant to thwart it. The plot versus the detective work is told simultaneously like in the Jackal. There's a nice section about uncovering a false-flag spy operation in London, and it's a jewel theft of all things that gets the ball rolling. An interesting disparity is set up between the Brit detective and his spy chief; one thinks the USSR can be beaten outright while the other feels he must acknowledge the USSR as an enemy that's here to stay."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"A very enjoyable read. Published in 1987. So, it is a little bit historical in its setting.I really enjoyed the way that the plot line was developed from two opposite viewpoints. The Russian side and the American side. And, switching from one narrative to the other.I thought enough of it That Im time sampling other titles by this author."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Frederick Forsyth has written some excellent spy and political thrillers in his time as well as a few lesser titles. The Fourth Protocol is one of his better ones, possibly a classic and with good reason. It benefits from the same meticulous style and attention to detail that the author brings to all his stories. The main protagonist here is John Preston, an ex-soldier working for MI5 whose personality clash with his superior sees him bounced around from one department to the next.During the course of this he uncovers a courier delivering a component for a nuclear bomb and so begins the effort to track down the agent who is assembling it and the consequences for the country Great Britain if his mission succeeds. Preston is dogged in his investigation but spends most of the book just a hair's breadth away from total failure and part of the enjoyment is watching as he gets such slight but lucky breaks that he is able to stay on the tail. It's suspenseful stuff and Forsyth is a master at building up the tension and tying loose strands together in a way which does the story justice. One criticism is that if you strip away the settings that this and Day of the Jackal have a lot in common, primarily in pitting an ice cold profession against a dogged but disadvantaged investigator.Another thing that is notable about the book, especially for anyone who has also seen the film is that the story does tend to go off on a tangent for about a third of its length as Preston investigates who is feeding NATO documents to a Communist spy working through the South African embassy. This is not bad per se but it feels like it could almost be a separate book in its own right and perhaps was once upon a time before being merged with the main story. The movie adaptation condenses this all down to about 10 minutes, shedding half a dozen characters along the way without radically interfering with the remainder. The movie version of the soviet agent Petrofsky has also been \\"sexed up\\" and has a larger body count to go with it but otherwise it is a faithful but highly watchable adaptation."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Fantastic cold war thriller. I occasionally had to set it down due to the intensity. A slow but hot burn."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"The world has moved on, but this is still one of the classic Forsyth novels. The methods may be old fashioned but the basic premise is still relevant; can a suitcase sized atomic device be assembled from smuggled parts, and used to bring about a change of government? This book is set in Thatcher's Britain, but it could easily be in Israel, Iran, North Korea, or any of today's hot spots. Highly readable."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"The book is written in a great style, in a quite superior form to some American best selling authors.I found it a liitle descriptive in some passages but I believe that they will be informative for some readers. One important topic was left without clarification. I can not tell what it is here, but attentive readers will understand what I mean.I recommend the book, even though I enjoyed &#34;Avenger&#34; more that this one."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"This was definitely worth the read. A similar style as The Day of Jackal and I would think an equally good book. Maybe a little short for my liking, but that's a personal thing. Not the best novel I have ever read, but Forsyth has a nice writing style to make for easy reading and to keep the reader interested.I did find the first part of the book explaining how all the different agencies worked etc a little tedious and a touch long winded, but once the book gets going, it gets much better.A nice read for a vacation."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"The leader of the Soviet Union is approaching retirement and badly wants to strike a major blow against NATO and the west before he hands over power to the next man. This desire ultimately gives birth to a horrific plot to destabilize Great Britain and push it out of the western alliance. John Preston, a British intelligence agent, races against the clock to stop the plan. He not only has to content with top Soviet agents, but is constantly undermined by a boss who sees only political maneuvering and ignores all signs of the imminent danger.Frederick Forsyth has a strong reputation as an author and many of his strengths are readily apparent in The Fourth Protocol. First, the plot is meticulously laid out and unfolds like clockwork as the novel progresses. The pace is steady and builds nicely right up to the climax. Next, the characters are well developed, probably to a greater than in Forsyth's previous novels (and, no I did not consider that a weakness in his earlier work). Not only is John Preston, the hero, well realized but the supporting cast and villains also come across as very three dimensional. I certainly won't go so far as to say I was rooting for the Soviets, but I did care what happened to many of those characters.This was the third novel by Frederick Forsyth that I've read. As much as I enjoyed the first two, I had thought this would be my last try because I wasn't as interested in the time and settings of his later novels. But having read The Fourth Protocol, I realize that I simply don't want to stop enjoying this author's work. After all, I never knew that I would be interested in France circa the reign of Charles De Gaulle before readingThe Day of the Jackal, and I found that book to be fascinating. Overall, this is an easy novel to recommend to anyone looking for an excellent spy thriller."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"with the help of kim philby, soviet russia is out to undermine and disrupt the political and democratical foundations of britain. with skill,humor and intelligence, this potboiler will surely enlighten you on espionage procedures, sinister plots and the triumph of good over evil. thanks again mr. forsyth!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Very good story, but the Kindle edition has several spelling errors!Very annoying and disapointing...How can they charge for such a lousy job?"},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Not as action packed as some of his others, but very, very good."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I found the book to be too political and hard to follow at times. Being set in the 80's , I felt I couldn't relate to it."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I read this one for thrills in the summer of 1985 when I was in chemsitry grad school. I found alot of things clever in that book. The part about the former Soviets smuggling in an atomic bomb piece by piece into a British port and then letting a man with a MS in Physics put it together and blow up an American air base in England to get the US nuclear weapons out of Europe was also nifty. The national news now speculates that terrorists would simply load an atom bomb onto a shipping container, put it on an ocean liner and blow it up in a major port like New York.Back then I was also into shortwave radio and had read an article in POPULAR COMMUNICATIONS about Cuban pirate numbers stations and the possible use of what they called a \\"one time pad\\" to decipher the coded number messsages really intrigued me. I had even logged a few pirates like that myself. I could hear some strange generator motor sound in the background! I even figured out how to count from one to nine in Spanish for awhile! But in thie book, Forsythe explained that the Soviets had sent compressed recorded messages in little chirp sounds coming from Radio Moscow on the top of the hour, The agent suppsedly recorded the message on a special tape recorder that played back the message at a much slower rate that the spy could understand. I had even wrote info for a resume back then on the back of some legal pad paper with those five number groups on them that my ex-wife had taken to a resume service for me; and she claimed she had met some older man in a fancy business suit in the lobby of the resume service when she came to pick it up! Was she messing with my head or was this for real?I know from Shotwave that the EC had wanted a nuclear free Europe as well.They did not like those Cruise and Pershing II missiles there, either."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"At first is a very good book, but is has to many things that are useless, for example the 2 letters that wrote Philby to the General Secretary of the former USSR (if you read the book you simply can jump these letters.)Another example is that the russian had to receive 9 mails to make a bomb in England from the former USSR, and in the nine mails the book writes the same stories how the mail get inside England and how is he dressed etc. (the same story nine times.)At the end the book just come down with the last persecution that is also repetitive at least three times and the very end of the book is really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I'm going to be the exception to the other reviews written before mine. I think this is a good thriller, but certainly not up to Forsyth's previous books, especially Day of the Jackal and The Odessa File. In addition, I have a problem with books like this one, AND Day of the Jackal, in which I have the constant thought, &quot;Well, this DIDN'T happen, so how involved can I get with this?&quot; In other words, DeGaulle DIDN'T get assassinated, and the catastrophe in this book didn't happen either. That, as I see it, is the problem in including historical characters and timeframes as an integral part of a book. In The Hunt for Red OCtober, on the other hand, there isn't as much historical linkage, and the plot is therefore much more believable. Furthermore, Forsyth lost me with his grossly excessive &quot;letters&quot; from Kim Philby to the Secretary General of the USSR, explaining the political left, and the poltical climate in general, in Great Britain. If I wanted a poli sci lecture, I'd go back to college! There must be better ways to give background info to the reader than the lecture format. I just skimmed through it, and therefore Forsyth didn't 'teach' me as much as he probably wanted to. Also, Forsyth has the obligatory (Hammond Innes does the same thing) hero with the broken marriage. Let's go back to James Bond, who's fascinatingly single, or George Gideon, who's happily married with an interesting family. And Forsyth doesn't even mitigate Preston's marital woes with a sultry female character. Why not just leave out Preston's family and declare him a &quot;I live to work&quot; guy? So here's the deal: read enough of the book to find out what the threat is (I won't tell you), then skip to the back, where the SAS comes in and saves the day. That's the best part. Then find something better to read."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"A spy thriller set in the Philby, Burgess and Maclean era of MI5.Here, a thief happens to discover secret documents outlining a plot to get a very hard left pro-Soviet government elected in the United Kingdom.With Philby involved, not just by your usual democracy, either, of course, so, fun and games for an MI5 agent who has been involved in investigating this far left sort of thing.The title of the novel refers to a nuclear treaty."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"The year is 1987. The place, London. Someone in the British Defense Ministry is funneling top secret military information to the Soviet Union. John Preston, a British intelligence agent of considerable skill, is handed the rather daunting task of finding out who is doing it and why.Meanwhile, in Moscow, a diabolical plot is being hatched to bring Communist rule to the British Isles using the most nefarious of tactics.Frederick Forsyth masterfully interweaves these two storylines using a narrative style that is detailed to the nth degree. The Fourth Protocal is highly suspenseful and filled with unexpected plot twists. Moreover, Forsyth dares to employ the unusual and somewhat risky technique of using a real life historical figure as one of the main characters....in this case the notorious double agent Kim Philby.The Fourth Protocol is an extremely engaging, well crafted and meticulously researched cold war thriller that does not disappoint. It ranks right up there among the genre's finest."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Frederick Forsyth's &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; written in 1984 before the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. is a classic offering in the political thriller and espionage genre.A by product of a jewel theft in London is the discovery that sensitive clandestine information has been traitorously pilfered by George Berenson, a member of the British Ministery of Defense.High ranking agent of the British Secret Service, M15, John Preston has been assigned to plug the leak and evaluate the damage. Exhaustive investigation unearths a plot nurtured through a South African source and eminating from the very top of the Soviet government. British traitor, Harold Philby, now a colonel in the KGB, has inspired a plot approved by the Soviet Secretary General created to topple the reigning British government. A pact to avoid broaching the &quot;fourth protocol&quot; would be violated resulting in the establishment of the hard left, Communist sympathetic Labour Party as the rulers of the British government. The fourth protocol was part of a treaty signed by nuclear powers is avoid certain types of nuclear proliferation.Forsyth creates a hard biting, chilling thriller that traverses through the highest channels of several governments. Such a scenario is still plausible in the tumultuous political climate existent today."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"It's only my personal opinion.....but I think this is quite possibly Forsyth's best novel. From the seemingly innocent burglary at the start to the suspense filled denouement, it is flawless. If you only ever read one Forsyth novel...make it this one."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"I'm not a devout reader of novels, and have started quite a few without finishing them. But this book kept me riveted. Make sure you don't have anything important going on in your life when you start this book! (Unless, unlike me, you are a fast reader.)As the ending drew near, I was literally shaking because of the tension (and that's certainly never happened to me before).Great book."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"What a great tale. Tension, fast moving plot, sometimes excruciating while the author takes the reader slowly through the thoroughness of the details, leaving the readers in suspense of the outcome.Like many masterpieces, villains and heroes are not always so well defined. British MI5 agent John Preston has the serendipidity to be at the right place at the right time despite his superior's best efforts to the otherwise. Uncovering the scent of a case after case, his doggedness enabled him to penetrate layers of deceit and patience rewarded by necessary breaks.The Russians were no less masters of the game, and in fact, better and it was through sheer bad luck that they were discovered.Despite the lengthy introduction of characters though, readers could not really feel for the cast, except for perhaps John Preston who was separated from his wife and looks forward only to spending time with his son.Nonetheless, the lack of characterisation was more than made up by brilliant twists and turns that would keep a reader continuing through anything."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Frederick Forsyth is a master of complex plotting and this book, published in 1985, is without a doubt one of his most complex.&quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; begins quite humbly with the simple burglary and theft of a mult-million dollar set of diamond jewelry from a London town home. Finding a sparkling tiara won't fit into his own carrying case, the burglar takes an attache case belonging to the owner and thereby saves the entire Western Alliance from collapse. Only Forsythe could pull this off. He does so with a cast of dozens, meticulous attention to plot detail and the sure knowledge of his readers' fear of communism and nuclear terrorism in the 1980s. The story begins slowly, but manages to hold the reader's interest through a series of accidents, mayhem and shrewd deductions of British intelligence officer John Preston. The story takes us back and forth from Europe to the Soviet Union, from Pretoria, South Africa to a U.S. air base in England, and all over Europe. Each new revelation brings the reader a little closer to the edge of his chair and the ending nearly sends him to hide underneath. Even though this thriller is somewhat dated in its Cold War mentality, it is still a wonderful, compelling novel. With only a bit of paranoia, the reader can substitute a Middle-East villain for the aging Soviet one in this novel, and scare himself silly."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"Another great book, I think he is the master of the spy vs. spy book. This was heads and tails above the movie. Great characters, I really disliked the antagonist. Good, smart story that still plays today. He pulls the rug out from under you a number of times so you cannot predict the outcome. I have never gone wrong with this author."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"This is really good. I am not much of a reader of thrillers, and the last one I remember really, really enjoying was Day of the Jackal, which I read about 30 years ago, or whenever it was new. This book was a tremendous cause celebre at the time and caused the word \\"jackal\\" meaning a professional political assassin to enter the popular language.I read Forsyth's next couple of books, and they were OK, but not exceptional. And then I read no more Forsyth until I picked this up in the Desoto County Public Library and was hardly able to put in down for the whole of the weekend.There are lots of writers of spy thrillers, but I think what makes Forsyth exceptional is the detail he goes into to describe how you might do something, like maybe disabling a burglar alarm, or famously (in Day of the Jackal), how to get a false British passport. This book is meticulously researched in terms of various criminal techniques, physical locations, structures of intelligence services, and even contains clear instructions on how to build your own small nuclear weapon. (Please do not try this at home; it may be injurious to your health.) I'm not sure how true all of this stuff is, but it seems as plausible as hell to me, and fact and fiction are so cleverly blended that you really can't tell where one starts and the other stops.What strikes me now, reading in 2005, is how much new technologies like cell phones and Internet communications have changed everything. I really doubt that spies still have to have secret radios hidden in the attic, or that their signals are triangulated by vast monitoring stations, so to some extent the story is already dated.But the threads of the story are wonderfully told and spun together to reach a lip-biting climax.I highly recommend this book. It would be ideal for airport reading and to pass the time on an intercontinental flight, but don't try it for bedtime reading, or you will be up all night.My rating scale:***** A not-to-be missed classic of the genre.**** Excellent work, the artist at his best.*** A good buy if you like the work of this artist.** Some good bits, but not worth going out of your way for.* Awful, not recommended at all."},{"Title":"The Fourth Protocol (1st Edition 1984)","review":"No one can tell a story like Frederick Forsyth can. The plot is masterly conceived and keeps the reader glued to each page. In typical Forsyth style, the plot comes together masterly at the end.

I was quite surprised to find that he is a talented writer who is able to create a fast-paced, gripping thriller with a lot of psychological punch. If you are reader of good fiction, even science-fiction (like me), then try this book out. It has many technological surprises.The story is basically about a top level Russian official who wants to bring down the current british government (maggy thatcher, hehe) and install his own covert government (the opposition, labour!). In order to do this he needs to sway the majority of the british vote to labour by launching a semi-terrorist type attack on a small british town. Seems odd? Well not at all because Forsyth makes you believe it by throwing in some of the most coolest characters alive since &quot;Gorky Park&quot;.

I can't even begin to imagine the kind of research required for writing a novel like this. Immensely eventful. gripping and a complete page turner.

Something as simple as how to make a bomb stretches for 4-5 pages. May be called overtly descriptive, but somehow fits into this novel's style and genre.

Bradford was chosen by Ronald Reagan as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. His appointment was intensely opposed by the neo-conservatives due to his critical writings on Lincoln and his support for George Wallace's presidential run. Hopefully the author's being viewed by the neo-cons as dangerous is enough to make you interested in his writings!\\"They never will love where they ought to love who do not hate where they ought to hate,\\" said Edmund Burke. Bradford knows where to hate. First, he hates equality (at least its use as a political axiom, where it is essentially meaningless), and has a fine essay in this collection on \\"The Heresy of Equality.\\" He also detested Lincoln (at least until he apparently softened somewhat in his final year of life), and provides an essay on \\"Lincoln, the Declaration, and Secular Puritanism: A Rhetoric for Continuing Revolution.\\"Bradford also loves. He loves liberty and those who seek to defend it. In this volume you will find sympathetic treatments of John Dickinson, Patrick Henry, and William Henry Drayton, as well as a defense of the secession of 1861.For lovers of liberty, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Better Guide Than Reason: Federalists and Anti-Federalists (Library of Conservative Thought)","review":"Bradford's work demonstrates how it was the \\"anti-federalists\\" and not the \\"federalists\\" who were the true architects in hammering out the substance of what emerged as the U.S. Constitution.

Should be required reading for all graduate students of the era.Eric MartinBethesda, MD"},{"Title":"A Better Guide Than Reason: Federalists and Anti-Federalists (Library of Conservative Thought)","review":"This book is a very poor example of scholarship. Bradford attempts to impose his hackneyed ideological theory on the men of the revolutionary and founding generation. He attacks such brilliant scholars as Bernard Bailyn for having the audacity to base his work on reality. In the place of past interpretations, Bradford invents an almost laughable concept of &quot;Old Whig&quot; thought, which in all truthfulness seems to have been made up out of thin air. I could go on and on about the horrible failings of this work, but that is not necessary. Instead, I will only point the potential reader of this work to true works of ideological scholarship, those of Bailyn, Gordon Wood, Caroline Robbins, H. Trevour Colbourn, Pauline Maier et al. While these works are not perfect, they are far superior to Bradford's brand of puerile revisionism."},{"Title":"Batman Illustrated, Vol. 2","review":"As a fan of the work of Neal Adams, it pains me to say that this book is almost ruined by Mr. Adams own modern re-coloring efforts. I respect his idea to re-color using modern technology, however his coloring style and technique seems amateur compared to most professional comics colored today. He disrespects his own line work and rendering abilities by over-shading every last detail with blurry, ultra blended, and overly dark color. No panel is left untouched. Areas where a flat color would be ideal, Mr. Adams chooses the opposite route-even going so far as to adding photographs (of clouds and moons, etc.) and using a number of bad Photoshop filters. Luckily, the numberous cover illustrations scattered throughout the book seem to be somewhat spared from this insanity.As for the comments by \\"alex\\" about the over-saturation of the colors-I think this is actually a result of the paper stock (ONE OF THE GOOD POINTS OF THIS BOOK IS THE PAPER USED-a wonderfully textured uncoated stock). Had this book been properly colored, the effect would have been gorgeous. What a shame.I really hate to criticize one of my heros this way, however I think it's important for this criticism to be voiced. If enough people complain, perhaps Neal will leave the coloring to the pros in subsequent volumes."},{"Title":"Batman Illustrated, Vol. 2","review":"It reprints all of the Neal Adams stories in chronological order.

I would think that this is a printing error on DC's part as the colors look too dark for me and artwork gets lost sometimes; I maybe wrong though.What's most interesting is this volume has not been selling in my area; in fact it went on sale not too long ago; the shop had so many these. it may be a neal adams book, but if it's not done right well watch out."},{"Title":"Batman Illustrated, Vol. 2","review":"Okay, here's the scoop.

Perhaps they corrected the problem with later printings."},{"Title":"Batman Illustrated, Vol. 2","review":"Comics in the 70s produced more muted colors than today's standard, probably because of the printing methods and paper quality. Flesh tones were generally of a light pinkish white (but could end up looking kinda jaundiced if you got a bad copy or the comic didn't age well). The colors for the reprints are glaring neon, with the flesh tones a bright orange. Sheesh, did Bruce Wayne join the Jersey Shore cast?And the kicker to all this is that the stories themselves aren't particularly good. The mood is right, that great transition back to the creature of the night, not Batman but The Batman. But the plotting/characterization/logic is hit-or-miss. So it's the artwork that has to carry the day. Had the original work been reproduced correctly, it would more than amply do that. Adams' work is gorgeous, true art. But this reprint is a pictorial botch.Concession #1: I'm a huge fan, I've bought all three and I'll probably never give them up...unless I can track down all the original issues or DC does a better job with a re-release later on.

In addition, the coverage of enterprise outline codes, enterprise fields, Project Web Access views, built-in functions and the differences between Project Center and Project views was all less than stellar. The other gripe I have is that what was deliverd in one book before (Chefetz's 2002 book), is now separated into two $50+ books.

Genevieve&quot; still stands as the ultimate scholarly work on Ste. Genevieve. While Ekberg's demolition of many old wivestales about the city's history generates the most talk among locals, this is just a footnote to the true value of his work.Through locating and translating thousands of Spanish and French documents from the colonial period, Ekberg succeeds in bringing the period to life and presents the most accurate picture to date of what life must have been like in colonial Ste. Genevieve.Like a compressed computer file, Ekberg somehow squeezes an unfathomable amount of information into this work. Yet it reads quickly and enjoyably. So many inticing issues are addressed: black-white, Indian-white relationships, family structure, economics, religion, romance, etc.Two books should be read by anyone interested in Ste. Genevieve (or French Colonial history in Mo.): Gregory M. Franzwa's &quot;The Story of Old Ste. Genevieve,&quot; and Ekberg's chronicle."},{"Title":"Colonial Ste. Genevieve: An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier","review":"Colonial Ste. Genevieve provides an excellent view of Eighteenth Century life in Ste. Genevieve, in particular and in French North-America in general. Founded in the early 1750s, not 1735 as popular history records, the story of Ste. Genevieve provides a view into the changing life in the Mississippi Valley as French gave way to Spanish colonialism and American ways took over, first at the governmental level and, gradually socially as the population changed from being primarily French to Anglo-American. The story of Ste. Genevieve mirrors the story of other French settlements in the area, such as Cahokia, Kaskaskia and St. Louis.From his role as a European history professor, Carl Eckberg relates events in Ste. Genevieve to developments in Europe which affected the town.His book is divided into various topics, such as relationships between settlers and Indians, the role of slavery in the community, the economy based in agriculture and lead mining, health care, town and regional government and church organization.For anyone interested in French colonial life in the heart of America, Colonial Ste. Genevieve is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Colonial Ste. Genevieve: An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier","review":"Many have written about Ste. Genevieve, MO, the oldest permanent European settlement in what once was the Upper Louisiana Territory. No one has created a more insightful or more scholarly look at 18th century life in the small Mississippi River town, however, than Carl J. Ekberg has done in his Colonial Ste. Genevieve.Ekberg uses his expertise in 17th and 18th century European politics to connect the villagers of Ste. Genevieve with the larger world around them. He examines the daily lives of the hardy French Creole (that is, those born in North America, of French ancestry) settlers, probing family, business, religious and slave/master relationships, as well as the settlers' means of making a living and defending themselves from Indian or Anglo attack or from the dangerous Mississippi. The mighty river forced the inhabitants to relocate two miles uphill from the original townsite, late in the 18th century.Ekberg is best known in Missouri for debunking a number of old myths, such as the town being founded in 1735 or before (He establishes its founding at shortly before 1750.) and the move to the new townsite being made almost en masse, right after the disastrous summer flood of 1785. (He has translated thousands of Spanish letters and documents, confirming that the move took nearly a decade and had started even before the flood, due to widespread erosion of the riverbank.) He also tackles &quot;puffed-up&quot; dates on historic homes in the town, which now relies on heritage tourism for economic growth. These findings have made him unpopular in some Ste. Genevieve circles. They have also marked him as the most important scholar to research the town.Despite his scholarly prowess and the intimidating inch and a half depth of the book spine, this book is a reward for the reader, not a punishment! Ekberg is no academic hack. His prose flows gracefully, often reading more like a historical romance novel than a history book. For anyone with an interest in French or Spanish Colonial settlements in the Louisiana Territory, or in the history of Missouri, this is a must-buy and must-read. Ste. Genevieve was and is a unique community and Ekberg's is the defining scholarly work on the town."},{"Title":"Colonial Ste.

Cary draws on his own experiences as a colonial official in Nigeria, drawing a rich, topical, authentic picture of the country during the early thirties. The eponymous anti-hero, referred to only as &quot;Johnson&quot;, is a pathetic creation who sees himself as an enthusiast for Empire, a champion of progress and civilisation, with the King of England numbering among his friends. In reality, he is despised by his European boss, Rudbeck, as a member of an inferior race. Johnson's life, his attempt to to become more English than the English, is set precariously between these two extremes -- the urgings of superiority and the reality of degradation, eventually leading him to the gallows. The story's culmination, involving larceny, treachery and murder, sees Johnson emerging as a pathetic but genuinely human creation, whose plight is an illustration of a genuine human dilemma."},{"Title":"Mister Johnson","review":"MISTER JOHNSON, perhaps the best of Joyce Cary's African novels, is about a man who fails to heed the reality all about him in favor of an illusory world of his own creation. Johnson is a Nigerian native; he comes to view the British colonial system, especially as represented by the incompetent road builder Rudbeck, through the prism of his African roots and experiences. Johnson tends not to filter things through the process of logical reasoning, but empirically through all his senses. The potential for disaster is great and is finally realized with the robbery and the subsequent murder he commits.Cary narrates the story in the present tense, which gives it a strong feel of immediacy. Johnson's delusions, from his total lack of understanding of his bride Bamu, who doesn't like him at all, though he doesn't realize it; his near worship of Rudbeck; and his even thinking he is above the law because \\"I king of all dem country\\" - a laughable self-deception if it didn't carry such frightening consequences, is sad and poignant. Despite being his own worst enemy, the reader can't help but sympathize with the ever singing, joyful, optimistic, Johnson."},{"Title":"Mister Johnson","review":"Please note that this is a play based on the book NOT the actual book.

What makes the book exceptional is his extensive use of Hasidic texts and how they are both relevant to our spiritual work and how these Hasidic masters were also deeply concerned with a mindful Jewish practice (though they frequently used the term Kavannah). This is a deeply thought out book and the author is quite clear in his commitment to both meditation and Judaism; its texts, its daily rituals, holidays, prayer, and the inner work to make them meaningfull pathways to come closer to a life filled with Holiness. One last point which is worth mentioning is that the author's strong background in Judaism and meditation affords him the ability to offer us practical guidelines in how to deepen our Jewish practice through meditation.

This is one of those books showing the opposition biting their own tongues. &quot;Lethal Laws&quot; is a reference guide which you can refer to from time to time. It is a great idea to read the book several times because of the need to absorb all of the information. I highly recommend this book for activists and non-activists alike.

It was reprinted as the MacMillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases. Check my list of favorite quotation books.

The model is then mirrored as an instance. The flat side is rescaled, [were not good]in and divided while in mesh mode. The new Geometry created with the divide tool is moved to round out the model. Finally the instanced half is made unique and welded to it's companion.Some body parts are made seperately and attached later, using the above techniques.That's most of the book!This isn't really modeling in my opinion, just a quickie rig...I was shocked at the bad quality of writing, the authors appeared to be trying to BS their way through and were doing a bad job of it. Paul Steeds \\"modeling a character in 3ds max\\" is a far better book.But both books leave out edge loop modeling which allows clean subdivison of surfaces: no distortion in smoothing.A 3D modeling student would learn much more reading Max tutorials (available free on the web) than buying this book. I would not recommend it!"},{"Title":"Game Modeling Using Low Polygon Techniques","review":"Please pocket your money. Don't shell it out on this book. This book is ALL about using the extrude feature in your 3D program. Extrude this, extrude that. It's tutorials are also VERY unclear and leave you hanging in the dark with unanswered questions. It uses awful, uninspiring art for sample work throughout the tutorials. You're better off learning on your own, experimenting with the controls and what not. What a \\"lie\\" . The title is very misleading. I am never buying anything from that publishing company ever again."},{"Title":"Game Modeling Using Low Polygon Techniques","review":"This book seems to be targeted at beginning to intermediate game artists. The only assumption it makes is that you know how to use your modeler of choice. The book is written to be software independent, although the only samples provided on the CD are for 3D Studio Max.The book takes you through the creation of a wide range of models, including a barbarian, a female marine, a couple of cartoonish characters, a horse, several vehicles, and a weapon. For each model, you are shown the step-by-step details at every phase of creation, including creating the concept art, turning the concept art into a base model, sculpting the model to it's final form, creating a UV map, and then texturing. Lots of screenshots are included (they take up about half of the book) making it easy to follow along.Although the book is definitely useful to someone just starting out in modeling, it seems a little light on content. The fact that so many different models are used - some of which are similar to each other - means that a lot of the information is repeated. I would have preferred fewer models with unique attributes, and more space spent on different methods or tips and tricks.Overall, though, I was happy with the book. If you're just getting started in game modeling, and want to see a lot of detailed examples of model creation, this book is definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"Game Modeling Using Low Polygon Techniques","review":"This book would have been relevent in 1995, but lots have changed in the game modeling world since then. The really weird thing about the book is the fact that they are working entirely in triangles instead of quads. It's close to impossible to really see your mesh flow and get proper \\"edge looping\\" in areas like the shoulders and knees, an issue not even mentioned in the book. The models may look nice, but when rigged, they will move like crap. Deformation is not even mentioned and like the above reviews state, all the pages talk about \\"Extruding\\" the edge profile. That's just a start. What about poly clean-up and edge spacing? You could easily trim this book down to about 10 pages. I recommend GAME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WITH MAYA(even for max users) instead because Antony Ward goes into \\"deformation testing\\" while modeling a character with proper edge loops."},{"Title":"Game Modeling Using Low Polygon Techniques","review":"This book has to many vague descrpitions that will leave the reader referencing every other reading material they own in order to figure out what the authors are talking about.

These aurthors tell the readers to reference models which are clearly not the original model they started working with as an easy way for the authors to move on, while the reader is left scratch their heads because what they have doesn't match with the authors, Any one learning modeling aviod this book, it will only fustrate you, save your money for something else."},{"Title":"Game Modeling Using Low Polygon Techniques","review":"The book will show you enough to know how to make a model and UV map the thing and to be honest when your new and want to get into modding games or somthing thats all you care about however in a way I agree with the ones that were unhappy with this book in regards to the fact that you do the same thing over and over but when your new thats all you do anyways so if you want to get your feet wet and &quot;have the EXTRA money&quot; go ahead and buy the thing it will teach somthing you didn't know.MAYBE:) Everyone has to start somewhere!!!!"},{"Title":"Game Modeling Using Low Polygon Techniques","review":"This book is easy to read and understand.

In *The Cannibal*, Hawkes' apocalyptic vision of post-war Germany attacks the reader in the form of an ever-deepening chill.

Is it possible for a book to be completely incoherent and confusing during and after reading, but still keep your finger on the next page? Apparently so, as this is certainly not the worst book I've read. It's unmemorable, sure, but John Hawkes at least exhibits a style that's free of the outright pretension that befalls authors like Pynchon and DeLillo. Interpret it how you may: &quot;The Cannibal&quot; is a book about nothing (maybe incoherence and WWII), but it is well-written, therefore it avoids a one-star rating."},{"Title":"The Cannibal -","review":"Hawkes has gained a strange and slobbering coterie within and beyond the academy: hopefully NOT on the basis of this amateurish novel.

The author is also a photographer here, so is not limited to vintage or collection holdings: his lovely black and white photos capture the antiques in their modern activities, while 23 profiles explores the trains' unique characteristics, the places which still run and maintain them to date, and passenger experiences along the way. Simply outstanding - not to be missed by any collection train buffs frequent."},{"Title":"Steam Trains: A Modern View of Yesterday's Railroads","review":"Excellent photographs. However, the light gray ink used for print makes it VERY difficult to read. I can understand the selection of this shade from an artists point of view, but it's a pity that those (over 60 year old) who will be most interested will have the poorer eyes.

Mr. Bell is a photographic artist."},{"Title":"Steam Trains: A Modern View of Yesterday's Railroads","review":"Books of pictures of steam engines pulling trains from the days when steam was king are quite common. In this book Mr. Bell, who readily admits that he didn't want to live back then when antibiotics hadn't been invented, and neither had air conditioning, television, etc. etc., has been taking photographs of steam locomotives for the last thirty years or so.These are engines that are still running, preserved and out on the high iron where you can see them once in a while.Here are the two UP engines, the 4-8-4 No. 8444, and the 4-6-6-4 'Challenger' No. 3985 (She just came through town here, and I couldn't believe the size of the mob that showed up to see her.)Here's the Durango & Silverton - you really need to ride this one twice. Once in the summer, and again in the winter when everything is snow covered.And besides that, there's another twenty or so engines shown from all parts of the country.I only have one complaint - the type in the captions of the photographs is printed in grey ink, and it's hard for my old eyes to see it unless I hold the book just so."},{"Title":"Steam Trains: A Modern View of Yesterday's Railroads","review":"My title says it all.

A remarkable and memorable book of military history, The Clyde At War features a wealth of black-and-white photographs enhancing the story of soldiers and civilians who lived, struggled, and died near the river Clyde."},{"Title":"Modern Electrochemistry 2A: Fundamentals of Electrodics","review":"These authors have a great writing style. This is a subject matter that has a potential to be very, very dry but the authors have somehow made it enjoyable. If they get into hardcore calculations and derivations that you might be a little rusty on, they anticipate that (I assume from lots of students' feedback) and include appendixes at the end of each chapter so that you don't need to run off and find the corresponding chapter in one of your math/physics/chemistry textbooks. They also have a very useful nomenclature guide (in the first book only) in case you keep forgetting what certain symbols mean and what units they are in. The footnotes are great and keep things from getting too dry. Overall, I would definitely recommend these three books.Note: Unless you have a fetish for hard covers, get the paperbacks; they're half the cost. When I bought these books from amazon.com, it was very confusing to figure out which books to get. Here are the ISBN's of each of the three books in the series. This will save you some headache:Electrochemistry 1: IonicsISBN: 0306455552 (paperback)Electrochemistry 2A: Fundamentals of ElectrodicsISBN: 0306461676 (paperback)Electrochemistry 2B: Electrodics in Chemistry, Engineering, Biology, and Environmental ScienceISBN: 0306463253 (paperback)"},{"Title":"Modern Electrochemistry 2A: Fundamentals of Electrodics","review":"First things first: this book, as the other two books in the series, are about electochemistry, not analytical electrochemistry. That is, in this volume in particular, the fundamental aspects of electrode reactions (that is heterogeneous electron transfer) are covered.This is not a book on electroanalytical techniques.The aspects regarding the motion of ions and molecules in solution (diffusion, migration...) are not covered (they are thoroughly explained in the first volume: Modern electrochemistry 1: Ionics) and are frequently referenced to, so i'd suggest you get some understanding of how they work before you venture into this book.Now let's get to volume 2A: i love this book. It is written in an extremely clear and concise style. The authors are very careful always to present the phenomena they're describing both with an inutive and with a more mathematical approach, while never losing touch with the physics behind them.The topics covered range from double-layer structure, to electrodics (kinetics including multi-step reactions, transpost phenomena, crystal structure influence on kinetics) and an introduction to quantum electrodics.At the end of each chapter is also a very useful list of papers that dig deeper into the topics presented. Basicly everything one can wish to find in a textbook.I cannot but encourage one to get all of the 3 books in the series (paperback, the hardcovers have a rather silly price...)."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"Professor Anderson has written a highly detailed account of early Texas history. His research and relating of detail is superb! I have found details in his book never seen before anywhere. He does have a strong bias in his writing that leans toward the native American's point of view (which is fine), and against various \\"white\\" men and groups (Texas rangers mainly). Overlooking this minor complaint, his book is excellant, and I am glad to have it as a reference. Not a \\"light read\\" at all, very detailed, almost like reading a thesis. Congratulations to Prof. Anderson for a well documented, well researched book. (the only claim I found objectionable thus far on page 127 where he claims Plains Indian societies never shot down women and children among their own....not true...see the Harrell archaeological site in Texas)"},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"Wow, what a powerful book! Although written from a different perspective, Anderson truthfully and bluntly describes the political ideology of the leaders in 1820 - 1875 Texas. Like it or not, he states the facts behind the privatization of public lands and the extermination of native peoples and animals (bison, etc.). Unfortunately, Texas has become a wasteland of millions of miles of high games fences (No Trespassing) and patchwork of cultivated farmlands that is blowing away with the drouth. Any wonder why it costs about $20/night to enjoy what is left! Maybe having all the West Texas lakes to dry up is not all a bad thing. I would recommend all who enjoy the outdoors to read this book, but maybe not so much the \\"sportsmen\\" who shoot deer from a stand while they come in to a feeder to eat. If they want real hunting, go West where such political policies were not practiced to the same degree."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"I came to Texas in 2007 and it is, by any means, a great state with great people. Diversity in all areas is noted. Have read several books on Texas history but this one tops all others, as pertains to the 19th century events. One cannot read this incisive book without getting a painful gut feeling about the violence, humiliation and outright barbarian practices of both the Anglos, Native Americans and others. This book is not for the \\"faint-hearted\\" but for those who want to see the hard-core truth of what really happened. It is both revealing yet riveting and heart-breaking. It gets a big 5-star rating."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"Anderson's work revises the old hagiographic view of Texas history written by T.R. Fehrenbach. This work exposes how much Fehrenbach relies on myth, outdated ideas (accepts the Turner Thesis as a whole), and stereotypes. Anderson pursues a more empirical approach.Just as importantly, Anderson relies on ethnographic as well as historical documentary sources. His narrative fits into more recent histories about the American West.Only caveat: his use of the term &#34;ethnic cleansing.&#34; The idea tends to place his narrative within a different framework usually understood.. He makes a good case for the term's usage, but he could have been more imaginative with the description to match the quality of his narrative."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"In line with toher new attempts to place ethic-cleansing, a modern concept, into history, such as Ilan Pappe'sThe Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, this book goes too far and is visciously biased. There may be much truth in what is written here, in the sense that the outcome was the virtual ethnic-cleansing, to use the modern term, of Indians from Texas. But this was not ethnic-cleansing from out of nowhere. Long before 1820 Spain had been the author of deprevations far worse than after 1820. Later Mexico would treat the natives no better.The conquest of Texas may have resulted in the removal and destruction of native tribes. But that doesn't mean that it should be compared to a form of genocide. The tribespeople also died of sickness and they were not pawns in this conquest. The tribes were active players and the Kiowas and others had important leaders who made choices as well, and many times those choices were not for peaceful coexistence, many times they were for war. In the end that war proved catastrophic. It is too easy to cry 'ethnic-cleansing' and 'racism' rather than examine the context of the time and understand what actually happaned on both sides.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"An excellent reconsideration of the far too-often mythologized history of Texas. Anderson has applied a modern concept in order to examine the early stages of Texas history and in doing so pushes the historiographical envelope. Solidly grounded in archival research and primary sources, the author and his work do not force the past into a presentist framework, rather, they consider the evidence on its own grounds and on its own terms. Revisionist? Yes, but that's the nature of the discipline, always has been, and always should be. The Conquest of Texas will have to be considered by all serious students of Texas and frontier US history."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"Professor Anderson tests the mythology of Texas Rangers battling depraved Indians against historical documents, and finds that it is built on nothing at all. The truth is, virtually all of the so called attacks by Native American tribes were created out of nothing, either by newspapers hungry to sell papers (an art form perfected by Hearst at the time of the Spanish American War), or by politicians seeking votes (reminding me of nothing so much as Bush's run-up to Iraq). The Rangers were basically in it for the plunder, and thus had a huge incentive to exaggerate every incident on the frontier, and in many cases, simply disguised themselves as tribal warriors as they raided fellow Texans.Combine this with repeated promises made by those very same politicians to tribal chiefs of territory which various tribes would be able to occupy as \\"theirs\\" \\"forever,\\" if they would only move off of whatever land Texans wanted at that moment. Most of these agreements never were implemented by Texans at all--and those that were implemented, were simply discarded as soon as population expansion put pressure on the \\"reserved\\" area.As Professor Anderson points out at the end, the real problem was that Texas politicians never were willing to concede that Native Americans had any legitimate right to live in Texas at all. The prevailing idea from the outset was that they should simply leave...and they ultimately did.The big flaw in this book is that the evidence Professor Anderson marshals is so detailed that a lay reader gets bogged down. There are only so many names (on all sides) that you can keep straight. None of the characters really come alive as feeling, dreaming people--all are simply cut-outs acting on a historical stage.By the way, ethnic cleansing is exactly the right phrase. It was not genocide--the goal never was to kill every Native American--only to get them all out of Texas. It was also not a war--virtually every \\"battle\\" consisted of armed cavalry storming through undefended Native American villages, randomly shooting into tents as the occupants (mainly women and children) slept. The Rangers rarely attacked armed warrior groups, and when they did, they were often beaten.Highly recommended for anyone who wants a detailed, serious history of the expansion of the anglo government control over what is now Texas. Not for the casual reader."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"The term ethnic cleansing is widely misused today. The proper term in this title would be genocide. Ethnic cleansing was used by Serbs in Bosnia to define what they felt they were doing, getting rid of people of the same race who had converted to Islam and, in the eyes of the Serbs, gone over to the enemy side, committing racial treason. Whether or not one agrees with the Serbs, they had a specific meaning for the term. The adoption by so many today in the news media and academia of the term \\"ethnic cleansing\\" as a synonym for genocide shows, in my opinion, a lack of clear thinking about terms."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","review":"Gary Anderson's book is nothing more than a new \\"politically correct\\" view of Texas History. Totally biased against the \\"white settler\\". Many historians today try to find a \\"niche\\" to write about. Professor Anderson loves to make the \\"caucasian\\" the villain. It is impossible to use today's current political, moral or ethnic standards and laws and apply them to the Texas frontier. It simply won't work. It was an era of kill or be killed and lawlessness. There were over 400 Indian tribes in America. All but two of these tribes went to war with other Indians. None of them \\"owned\\" land or had a title or deed to land. The westward expansion was going to happen and the Indian tribes were defeated by the American Army. This type of land takeover has happened throughout history on every continent and island. Professor Anderson seems to feel there was an unwritten conspiracy by the \\"white man\\" to eradicate the Indian and Mexican.This is simply not true. Before the Texas revolution settlers in Texas treated the Indians far better than the Spanish or Mexicans before them and even attempted to live in peace with the Indians. Sam Houston had the cooperation of the Indian tribes and the tribes supported the Texians in the revolution. But after the war, Indians would not stop stealing, especially taking horses and children. Professor Anderson attacks every document of fact; For example his treatment of the great document, \\"Indian Depredations in Texas\\" by Joseph Wilbarger is without any merit and his attacks on this book are all hearsay. Mr. Wilbarger,who was himself a victim of Indians who scalped him and killed members of his family wrote this book because he said \\"historians will someday try to change the truth about the Indians of Texas\\". Read the original Indian depredation claims on file with the US government. Go visit the areas of Indian attacks and talk to the families of survivors and see the documentation they have and you will realize this book is an attempt to change history. Frontier families in Texas, from the east piney woods near Tyler all the way to LLano in the Hill Country were slaughtered and massacred by Indians on a weekly-monthly basis. Indians from Oklahoma territory raided Montague county and killed over 30 persons. Indians near Tyler murdered and killed 18 men near Jacksonville working in the fields. Indians in Llano killed and raped women and babies and kidnapped the children. The Texian settlers weren't trying to destroy a \\"race of people\\", they were just trying to survive and live in peace. When you realize men were having their wives raped and murdered and children stolen and killed you can understand the reason that finally the Texans decided \\"enough is enough\\" and tried to annilate the Indian tribes. The Commanches, Kiowa, Apaches and other fierce tribes weren't going to stop just to be nice and left alone. It wasn't racism that but fear that drove the war against the Indians. If you want a \\"true read\\" about the events of the past then read \\"Indian Depredations in Texas\\" and \\"The Commanches\\"...forget this book.."},{"Title":"On escalation: metaphors and scenarios","review":"During The Cold War the Rand Corporation and the Hudson Institute were associated with work on nuclear warfare and the conduct of the Vietnam War. Herman Kahn produced a number of books on the subject in the 1960's including: \\"On Thermonuclear War\\", \\"Thinking About the Unthinkable\\" and \\"On Escalation\\". Kahn was also concerned to document the process of escalation of conflict and to establish common metaphors and language, which could be understood by both sides. Kahn stressed the essential role of communications between opposing sides. He pointed to the cultural problems which made it difficult for the US and North Vietnam to understand the way in which the other side would react to new developments during the Vietnam War.In \\"On Escalation\\" Kahn pointed out the problems that arose between the British and the Germans in World War II because German propaganda failed to clearly communicate German intentions.The same problem currently bedevils the relationship between Israel and the Arabs. At worst we have a \\"dialogue of the deaf\\". Normally even during War there will be a dialogue based on mutually agreed rules, for example the rights of civilians will be honored. Where one side fails to honor the implicit agreement not to behave in a particular manner then the other side will normally feel free to retaliate in ways that it has previously forsworn. The reaction to September 11th is a classic example. Where communication breaks down, as appears to have occurred in Israel, this can result in action and reaction, leading to a spiral of violence and alienation, which can only be resolved by the total collapse of one side, or an understanding by both sides that the mutual interest requires a stepping-back from such actions. In the US the public protests effectively ended US involvement in the Vietnam War.In short Kahn deals with important issues that are if anything more relevant today than they were in the 1960's. Not the easiest of reads, pick something lighter for your next flight, but if you are interested in the process of negotiation, rather than the headline news then you should look at Kahn's ideas."},{"Title":"Sanctuary (Star Trek, Book 61)","review":"I can't actually write a review for this kindle edition of Star Trek, Sanctuary.

The plot was interesting, altough a bit predictable at times, but it was nice to see original characters to play out important parts in the story, particularly since the main characters were no else than the same old and predictable Kirk, Spock an McCoy.

The main plot situation seemed a bit forced; I find it hard to believe that Kirk &amp; company would have gotten themselves into that situation, and equally hard to believe that the way out that they found was truly the best solution that they could find, but all in all it was an enjoyable if unremarkable read.

The plot was a little sketchy, but the character developement was very good. Most of the novel centers arround the Kirk-Spock-McCoy trio, and the authro does a very good job of getting each of the respective characters down. The ending leaves a little to be desired becuase, after a harrowing experince by our crew, we never really learn what happens to the other people who've been subjected to live on this aweful planet.

Thus the main challenge of the book - how do our intrepid three break out and get back to the 'Enterprise'?#2 - I used to be a gigantic reader of Star Trek books. In the 80's and very early 90's I had a rather large collection. In fact, my cousin and I had a complete collection if we put ours together. I was quite the fan. I ran across this book and picked it up for old times sake and discovered that 'You can't go home again'. The old magic just was not there. Not that I dislike the characters or even the basic plot idea. It was the way the book was written:-The supporting characters are one-dimensional cutouts.-There's no character development.-The planet is apparently covered with the same plantlife since they encounter it in nearly every outdoors scene.-I found myself being drawn into the last scene until I realized that my own fear of heights was making me imagine it much, much better than it was written.Probably the last of the series for me.

This book forms the bedrock and foundation for understanding &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; it was necessary to forge a wedge between poor whites and blacks, who together, often conspired to runaway from their master, and how black Americans gradually moved from a position of quasi-servitude to perpetual slavery.

It reveals how laws contributed to inflicting injustice on millions of Americans, solely on the basis of their color. The State of Virginia, a model of agricultural and economic success, a leader for all the colonies played a major role in the ultimate institutionalization of slavery. The State of Massachusetts after numerous trepidations abolished slavery in 1783. The State of New York though not steeped in slavery exuded certain prejudices. Although \\"Free Blacks\\" might join the militia and buy real estate, Jews were barred from both. In South arolina, by 1708, less than 20 years after the decision to move from white indentured labor to black labor, black slaves out numbered white inhabitants. In the State of Georgia, the indentured slave system broke down. The need to increase the number of white residents and to assure an adequate and cheap labor supply caused the financing of transportation to Georgia of many free unindentured persons (called charity olonists)and granted them up to fifty aces of land. Another group of emigrants (called adventurers) paid their own passage and received up to 500 acres of land. In the State of Pennsylvania the destruction of slavery was achieved to a great extent through the private actions of Quakers and Germans freeing their slaves and cajoling their neighbors to act likewise.The book's contents are well researched, with cases and legislation written to be understood.

However, it has a better ring to it than \\"From Sahelanthropus tchadenis to Language\\" and Lucy is probably one of the best know discoveries. (Donald Johnson by the way being one of the discoverers of Lucy).Overall, this is an excellent introduction to the science of paleoanthropology (the study of ancient humans) and the evidence that has been accumulated on the evolutionary history of modern humans.It is a large format book - a coffee table book size although most people don't leave books on their coffee table with picture of skulls in them. This large format allows for the often full size photographs of the evidence, which are simply magnificent photographs primarily taken by David Brill. Although I haven't counted them, I would guess there are over 100 pages of these photographs that allow you to see the actual evidence while it is being described in the text.The book is divided into two major sections - the first hundred pages or so is called \\"Central Issues in Paleoanthropology\\" and this reviews key concepts and issues in the subject in a series of 48 short sections looking at everything from techniques of paleoanthropology, to problems of evidence to art. This is clearly written for the general reader and does a good job of explaining some difficult and often contentious areas without oversimplification. I liked the way they would use technical terms but explain them and repeat that explanation at various stages throughout the book. However,at one or two points it can become too superficial and more pop-science than serious science and there a few silly comments like \\"a prefrontal cortex that is more than 200% smaller than that of the human brain!\\". Fortunately these moments are rare.The second section is called \\"Encountering the Evidence\\" and this presents, over about 150 pages, many of the major finds with a one or two page background on the find and its significance accompanied by a full page (or sometimes two pages) photograph of the actual evidence. To be able to see the evidence in so clear a way helps to understand the difficulies of collecting evidence, why there are often strong disagreements but at the end shows a strong case that there is a line of evolution that can be demonstrated.In a very contentious and aggressive area of science, Johansen and Edgar, appear to have pulled together a balanced view of the current state of science including the very recent (and definitely contentious) Homo floresiensis find in Indonesia. Clearly Johanson has a view and expresses it but does reference diffences of opinion (if only briefly sometimes)Apart from some of the occassional sloppy writing in the first section, two other minor quibbles. In the second section, each find is independently described within a species and the finds seem to be presented in estimated age of the specimin. This may seem to be logical but it does get a little confusing when the actual date of finds are in a different order as the narrative refers to events that you have not yet read about. One recurring and more irritating issue is in the editing. Words are missed out or misspelt and in a couple of the captions on the photograph the text is cut off at one end. A shame for such an otherwise well laid out book.Overall, highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about the issues in human evolution and actually see the evidence."},{"Title":"From Lucy To Language: Revised, Updated, and Expanded","review":"This is a fascinating, up to date survey of human evolution presented with lucid and thoroughly researched text.

Great book overall and very informative."},{"Title":"From Lucy To Language: Revised, Updated, and Expanded","review":"The title of this book is at the same time both informative and misleading.It's misleading because it actually goes back millions of years before Lucy walked the earth. And its discussion on language is quite minimal. So if you are looking for a book on language or Lucy, you might want to look elsewhere.On the other hand, if you're not being quite this picky, this is an excellent overview of the development of humankind. Dr. Johanson was on the team that discovered Lucy, and since this is the second edition of the book which now goes back further than Lucy changing the name might not have made sense.The book goes back further because new findings in the fossil record now go back to some 7 million years (Lucy is 3.5 millian years old).The problems with printing any book like this are clearly illustrated by the 'Kennewick Man.' The previous edition of this book was published in 1996. A very short while later, the 'Kennewick Man' was discovered in Washington State that may completely alter the way we think the Americas were populated. This individual died about 9,400 years ago and reconstruction of his appearance from the skull remains has him looking a lot like Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart.

LOUIS BRIDGE","review":"In the steamboat era, St. Louis, Gateway to the West, was the fourth largest city in the US, while Chicago was little more than a crossroads. If one were to write a history, the first chapter would be the story of the railroad system built by the State of Missouri. It included a network of roads--Missouri Pacific, Frisco, Iron Mountain, and North Missouri (Wabash)-designed to fan out across the state bringing all traffic to St. Louis. Stock was sold to land owners and county governments, who hoped railroads would increase the value of land-locked land. Bonds were guaranteed by the state.But Chicago interests, unencumbered by threats of Civil War, won the competition. Backed by Boston financiers, they completed the Hannibal and St. Joseph (CB&Q;) across the state before completion of any of the state railroads. Along the way, 43 were killed on the inaugural run of the Missouri Pacific when a bridge over the Gasconade River collapsed. Those killed included some of the most progressive boosters in the state. The state railroads went bankrupt. The state assumed their debts. Missourians paid twice for their railroads. Costs that were scandalous in construction of the Transcontinental Railroad through mountainous terrain, were paid quietly by Missourians for railroads built through their rolling hills.In the second chapter, Missouri interests hoped that Kansas City or St. Joseph would be selected as the Eastern terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad. Possibly a Southwestern route would be built from Kansas City that would avoid the difficulties of keeping a railroad passable through the mountains in Winter. Again Chicago interests won. Omaha was selected (and railroad building across Iowa took off with vigor).Jackson's volume describes the third chapter. Chicago had built a drawbridge across the Mississippi at Davenport, IA, in 1855, but it was destroyed by a steamboat collision and fire in 1856. A young Abraham Lincoln represented the railroad in a lawsuit filed against the bridge company (and supported by St. Louis interests). He won the argument that bridges must permit free passage of both railroads and steamboats. Now forces were building to build more Iowa bridges. St. Louis needed a bridge to compete, but the Mississippi in St. Louis is a much more formidable obstacle and bridge building was still a primitive art. Enter James Eads, not really an engineer, but a charismatic, accomplished, doer of projects. He had backing from Pennsylvania Railroad interests (the leading US railroad, whose tracks ended on the East side of the river at St. Louis). Active in the bridge project were president, J. Edgar Thompson, vp Thomas Scott, and Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie is best known as the builder of what became US Steel in Pittsburgh, but he began his career at the Pennsylvania Railroad, where his business skills were noted. He was protege to Thomas Scott. In the Eads' Bridge story, he was present as representative of Keystone Bridge, a private company founded by Pennsylvania Railroad interests to specialize in the construction of iron bridges especially for railroads. Keystone constructed the bridge to James Eads' design.Author Jackson notes the Pennsylvania Railroad's interest in the Texas Pacific and the Northern Pacific as well as the Atlantic and Pacific (Frisco) and North Missouri (Wabash) in Missouri and suggests this indicates a desire to build a transcontinental railroad system. Its more likely the Pennsylvania thought it important to take care of its feeder lines. Railroads make their money on ton miles. Freight that runs the length of the system is most profitable. Therefore, its important for an East-West system like the Pennsylvania to maintain relationships with lines to the West so they can swap traffic. They do this with personal relationships, and by lending management expertise (as board members) and prestige to assist with financing-preferably without investing the railroad's own capital.In an age of Enron and Adelphia, its interesting to see the ethics involved in some of the transactions. Robber barons like Jay Gould are known to have bled railroads dry while operating them in bankruptcy. Usually this was accomplished by executives personally owning businesses that sold key supplies to their own railroad-coal, railroad ties, bridges, etc. Profitable construction companies was the device used in the Credit Mobile scandal related to the Transcontinental Railroad. The book suggests that executives of the Pennsylvania Railroad also engaged in these self-dealing practices, practices that would be considered unethical today.The book tells the full details of the construction of the bridge including the use of caissons to sink the pier foundations to bedrock and the discovery of the bends as the affliction of workers who worked in high air pressure and decompressed quickly. The bridge is mostly iron but used some of the first steel, and fabrication of this steel was troublesome. Numerous difficulties were encountered. The book includes copious illustrations. Its well written and tells the story well.The book ends in chapter four of our railroad history. Jay Gould becomes the owner of most Missouri railroads and leasee of the Eads' Bridge. He assembled the structure (after years of delay) that finally created a terminal railroad association to construct the first Union Station and the necessary trackage to connect the bridge and the railroads of St. Louis. Other sources indicate Jay Gould's railroad empire in Missouri was assembled to force admission to the Iowa Pool, a revenue sharing arrangement for the lines that connected with the Transcontinental Railroad. He failed in that aspect, but succeeded in being a robber baron, though his empire collapsed soon after his death.In the end, Eads' Bridge probably came too late to have much impact on the St. Louis-Chicago competition. It did alleviate a serious bottleneck that otherwise might have been a limitation, but the bridge was expensive, and the tolls charged by Jay Gould were high. According to Jackson, the bridge still had $5MM in bonded indebtedness recently-even now long after it is obsolete, but it still is a much deserved landmark to the Spirit of St. Louis."},{"Title":"Dangerous Intentions","review":"For the second time in her life, magazine editor Kiley Chapman is experiencing excruciating fear. After being kidnapped and terrorized 10 years ago, she had promised herself that she'd never be put into that position again, so she's reacting to threatening phone calls by stubbornly refusing to admit that they could actually mean something. While her uncle is busily trying to get her to accept a bodyguard, she is busy at the magazine, working on an article on a real life hero. She advertises for a real life hero, and is amazed by several of the responses she gets. These guys couldn't be for real. While interviewing one of her hero possibilities, the situations turns ugly-and the moment is saved when Scott Danger, another candidate for the hero article, barges in and saves Kiley from the aggressive applicant. She's stunned by his awesome physical appearance, and also by his macho, sexy demeanor. Could he really be the hero she's looking for?Scott Danger, Security Specialist, accepts this one last assignment to be a bodyguard to Kiley Chapman because it means so much to his boss. But there's a catch that her uncle reveals-he must get Kiley to accept him into her life without letting her know that he is actually her bodyguard. He knows there will be no problem when he hears about the hero contest-he's done some incredible feats in his lifetime, so he can get her to accept him without revealing his true occupation. And when he meets Kiley, he is stunned and instantly drawn to her in a way he has no desire to be drawn to any woman. He pushes her into accepting a dinner invitation with him, and when the evening ends in the discovery that her best friend and assistant has been brutally attacked, Scott decides he's not leaving this pretty lady's side for anything. He's certain that the attack was meant as a sign to Kiley...a sign that she's going to be next.Kiley fights the need for a protector, and when she finds out that Scott is actually a bodyguard hired by her uncle, she is furious and demands that he be let go. But is she really making the right choice? Not only is she sure that someone is out to get her, but she's also sure that the something she feels when Scott is around is something she doesn't want to let go. The battle of wills between the two, and the sparks they send flying, are a wonder to read about. They light a fire in the pages, making you zoom to the next page.This is my first Denise Agnew book, and I can assure you it won't be my last. With hot, zippy writing, she makes the story fly by, and you're waiting with baited breath to see what's going to happen next. While we actually know who done it, Ms. Agnew weaves a level of suspense that will have you guessing, and a truly wonderful romance together splendidly. The big, sexy Scott is the perfect match for the spunky, independent Kiley, and she introduces a crew of characters that I can't wait to read more about. What an exceptional read!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Intentions","review":"Denise sure knows how to write a terrific romantic suspense and this one is no exception.

This book overviews what was known about them in the early 1960s. In spite of its age, it can still be read profitably by anyone interested in harmonic analysis and Hardy spaces.Chapter 1 gives a quick review of the mathematical background needed for reading the rest of the book, mostly dealing with measure theory, and Banach and Hilbert spaces.In chapter 2, the author gives a detailed treatment of Fourier series over the closed interval from -pi to pi. The chapter is designed to answer two questions, namely whether a function is determined by its Fourier series, and given a particular Fourier series, how one can recapture the function. These questions must be addressed in the appropriate norm on the Banach space of Lp spaces of Lebesgue integrable functions. There are many methods of recapturing the function, and the author discusses a few such methods, one being the Cesaro means. The authors proves that for a function in Lp, the Cesaro means of the Fourier series of the function converge to it in the Lp norm (when p is greater than or equal to 1 but less than infinity). When p is infinity, the author shows this is true in the weak-star topology. The author then shows how the Cesaro means can be used to characterize the different types of Fourier series.Analytic and harmonic functions in the unit disk are defined and studied in chapter 3. The first question the author addresses is to what extent these functions are determined by their boundary values. The author shows how to represent these functions on the closed unit disk using the Cauchy and Poisson integral formulas, thus answering this question. The second question he addresses is the behavior of these functions on the boundary, i.e. the Dirichlet problem. His methods for harmonic functions are analagous to those for Lp under the guise of Cesaro means, i.e. Cesaro summability becomes Abel summability. The author shows this connection more rigorously by proving Fatou's theorem. Hp spaces are defined in this chapter, and the author illustrates one of the major differences between the harmonic and analytic functions.The author begins the study of H1 spaces in chapter 4, initially via the Helson-Lowdenslager approach. He first proves Fejer's theorem for functions which are continuous on the closed unit disk and analytic at each interior point: the real parts of these functions are uniformly dense in the space of real-valued continuous functions on the unit circle. Szego's theorem, which gives a measure of the &quot;distance&quot; from the constant function 1 to the subspace of these functions that vanish at the origin, is proved, as well as the Riesz theorem, which shows that analytic measures on the unit circle are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. He then applies these results to H1 functions, showing that such functions cannot vanish on a set of positive Lebesgue measure on the circle without being identically zero. The author then generalizes these results to Dirichlet algebras later in the chapter, showing to what extent the Riesz theorem carries over.The important factorization theorems for Hp functions are covered in chapter 5, wherein the famous Blaschke products come in. Their properties are discussed in detail, along with the ability to represent a non-zero bounded analytic function in the unit disk in terms of them. The author proves a theorem of Hardy and Littlewood on H1 functions of bounded variation and a theorem of Hardy on the growth of the Fourier coefficients of an H1 functions.The author studies the algebra A of continuous functions on the closed unit disk which are analytic on the open disk in chapter 6. The factorization results of chapter 5 are used along with the theory of commutative Banach algebras to characterize completely the closed ideals in A. Wermer's maximality theorem, which states that A is a maximal closed subalgebra of the continuous complex-valued functions on the unit circle, is proven.The shift operator on the (Hilbert) space H2 is studied in chapter 7, the goal being to classify the invariant subspaces of this operator. The author uses a more classical approach due to Helson and Lowdenslager to do this. The shift operator on L2 (on the unit circle) is then considered, and its invariant subspaces described. The author finishes the chapter with a short discussion of the representations of H(infinity).After a study of Hp spaces on the half-plane in chapter 8, in chapters 9 and 10 the author predominantly looks at Hp and H(infinity) from a &quot;soft&quot; analysis point of view. He shows that the isometries of H1, induced by conformal mappings of the unit disk onto itself, can be studied by studying the isometries of H(infinity). The projections from Lp to Hp are discussed, the author providing readers the necessary background for a study of Toeplitz operators, if they so desire. The topology of the maximal ideal space of H(infinity) is considered, but at the time of publication it was not known whether or not the open unit disk is dense in this space. This is the famous corona theorem of Lennart Carleson, which he proved as this book went into publication."},{"Title":"Banach Spaces of Analytic Functions","review":"the book is a cornerstone of any serious inquiry in Hardy spaces and the invariant subspace problem; it is also hightly readable and well written. people interested in a second course on complex functions, harmonic analysis and functional analysis (banach and hilbert spaces) should have a look at it; it deserves it and the reader will be richly rewarded..."},{"Title":"Banach Spaces of Analytic Functions","review":"This is a classical and nice book.

Otherwise, all other advice and messages they are going to get are likely going to be the wrong ones, given today's pop culture and society. Ya got to sow the seeds of wisdom early so they can take root before the weed seeds get thrown in.I wish I had known this stuff back when I was at that stage of life, it would have saved me from a lot of confusion and pain!PS - A couple years ago I gave this book to young Presbyterian friends of mine. Both girls said they appreciated the good advice and ideas in it.

Don't settle for less."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"I am a practicing Catholic a college student who is engaged to another practicing catholic and my advice is don't waste your time on this book. We read it as a couple a found many parts of the book completely ridiculous if not offensive. Particularly that parts on sex in marriage and what is and is not appropriate. And the ridiculous sections on pet names to call your husband names such as: \\"You big gorilla\\". What is \\"oversexed\\" is this book! Not only was offended personal but my intelligence was also offended, and my sense of humor. But MAINLY this book does a great disservice to the beautiful Catholic teachings on sex, marriage and family. The books I would recommend instead are:Love and ResponsibilityCatechism of the Catholic Church: Second EditionIntroduction to the Theology of the Body: An Adult Faith Formation Program Based on Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body"},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"First, this book is in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church. So this criticism is not intended to imply that this book is somehow heterodox, it is not.But frankly, the advice is not so good. It certainly does not apply to everyone. And some of the suggestions, frankly, left me scratching my head.I am a middle-aged man who finds himself single again, yet able to marry in the Catholic Church. Little of the suggestions or advice in this book apply to someone my age. And since I was married before, I can say that some of the suggestions regarding married life are more likely to cause trouble than solve it.I suppose a younger person, who is exceptionally psychologically stable and well-adjust and in an environment where there are many \\"dateable\\" people would be able to employ *some* the techniques in this book. But that is about it.Save your money."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"\\"Most of the members of NOW are lesbians\\", women who dress (in the eye of the beholder) suggestively are \\"raping men\\", \\"women are obliged to modesty more than men.\\" If you believe these statements then this is the book for you, if however, you find these sentiments to be mean spirited, petty, sexist, and downright ludicrous and insulting then don't waste your money on this book. This is easily the most depressing relationship book that I have read. Like many Catholics and other Christians that would choose to read a book with this title, I was looking for moral support and advice to live a chaste, self-respecting life and find someone of like mind to share that life. My disappointment in this book is immense. The overall message is that men are weak and women are wicked. There is a religious group that believes this- it's called the Taliban...Fr. Morrow please join them and leave the Catholic faith to those who fairly and accurately portray it."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"I am a practicing Catholic and I found this book to be incredibly offensive. The suggestion that unions between Catholics and non-Catholics or non-Christians are to be discouraged is absolutely ludicrous - Jesus gave us a mission on Pentecost, that we as Christians are called to spread his word to all people and all nations. That's ALL nations. He did not say \\"shun all atheists, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, agnostics, and other non-Christians, because they will only drag you down.\\" This is the man who broke bread with tax collectors, prostitues, and sinners - I should think that He is calling us in a very special way to befriend those who may not share our beliefs. What better way to explore Christ's teachings of tolerance and compassion than to explore the possiblity of a non-Christian spouse? The Church will readily and happily marry a Catholic and non-Catholic, provided the couple promises to raise their children in the Faith.This book also suggests that a desirable quality in a potential spouse would be one who wants a family in which the mother raises the children and the father is the financial breadwinner. Perhaps this was a cultural belief some time ago, but the Church has NEVER so much as implied that women belong in the home and men in the workplace. The Catechism, when speaking of the rearing of children, always refers to the parents, never simply the mother or father, as having this obligation. The Catechism also states that ALL human beings are called to work, and that \\"everyone has the right of economic initiative\\" (sect. 2429). In other words, both men and women are equally called by Yahweh to make gainful use of their talents and (if called) to raise children.It is a shame that this book claims to be teaching the values of the Church - it has no doubt already offended both Catholics and non-Catholics by publicising beliefs that are mere hangovers from the early 1900's. As a Catholic myself, I am terribly offended, and I sincerely hope than no-one else was insulted by this misinformed and fallacious guide to the teachings of the Church."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"I'm really surprised that no one has reviewed this book. I have met Fr. Morrow and if any of you live close to Washington, DC, please visit his parish. When I read this, I could not put it down. I even ordered extra copies of this book, and gave them as gifts to a few of my buddies. Alhough this review is written from a man's perspective, the content pertains to both sexes.The content of this book is on a mature level, with an audience reaching the 25+ age bracket. I recommend it for people who have been out of college for a few years and have discerned a vocation to the marriage covenant. This book is definitely not for John Q. Public who is looking to take someone home from a bar on Friday night.A large part of what Fr. Morrow touches on is that our culture really needs to change. Sadly, pre-marital sex has become much of the norm, and too many people decide to become a \\"couple\\" after the 2nd or 3rd date. This had led to not only quite a bit of heartbreak, but also a serious lack of trust in others. Our society has become a \\"friends with benefits\\" world, which has led to a breakdown in the \\"sanctity of marriage\\" and the marriage covenant.A lot of the \\"heartbreak\\" associated with secular dating today has been destroyed due to pre-marital sex. Lovemaking should only take place within the sanctity of marriage, and the marital embrace shall always be open to life.The best courtship is a chaste and honorable courtship. Sadly, many men (I can pick on men, I am one) have forgotten how to do this. What I liked best about this book is Fr. Morrow suggests doing some \\"friendship dating\\" for at least one to three months before making a \\"commitment\\" to someone. It is fun to take a young lady to an art museum, send her flowers, write her letters, or go for long walks in the park. Attending Mass together and praying together are wonderful things to do too. Fr. Morrow also throws in some ideas for some good \\"cheap dates\\" that are not only fun, but also creative.Fr. Morrow touches quite a bit on formation (before finding Miss Right, you need to be Mr. Right), questions to ask, and conversations to have during the courtship process. There is also an excellent chapter written on modesty and communication.Fr. Morrow gives some insights on places to go to meet a prospective spouse, such as Catholic seminars and pro-life events. However, he stresses that people go because you are interested in participating in a cause or hearing a lecture, not just finding someone to go to a movie with Saturday night.As a never married Catholic man in my mid 30's, (I was in my late 20's when I \\"returned\\" to the faith, and began to learn more about it), I find that there are quite a few single Catholic women who are looking for a Catholic man to step up to the plate. Many devout Catholic men have not taken enough initative in this area, and I think that is one reason why quite a few Catholic women are marrying men outside of their faith. Another reason I think alot of Catholic women have been marrying outside their faith is they find that there are several \\"Catholic\\" men out there who are not truly Catholic, and do not meet their expectations.Catholic men, I urge you to learn your faith well and practice it. If you are called to marriage, please take some initiative in finding good Catholic spoouses. They are out there. Don't give up. I have met several nice and authentic Catholic women over the past few years who are not only highly intelligent, fun, well-educated, smart, committed to their faith, but also very beautiful inside and outside.I appreciate the work Fr. Morrow did in putting this work together, and he holds firmly to his beliefs and those of the Holy Catholic Church. The orthodoxy is here, and the Catholic Faith is Alive!!Therefore Catholic men, let's throw some dinner parties (a lost art) and invite some nice Catholic women over to make some new friends."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"This is the map for the Christian counterrevolution on matters sexual. It is a book that any parent, any single, any grandparent, and any educator should have. And certainly pastors should read it and preach it. The book is specific and answers specifically the age-old question of how much physical contact is prudent in a Christian courtship (of course, no sex, but even restraint in kissing). Fr. Morrow advocates a two-stage process: first non-exclusive friendship dating with no kissing or even hand-holding, only nice hugs. If the two \\"friends\\" find that they have a mutual interest in exploring the possibility of marriage, they then agree to enter the courtship period where gentle and restrained kissing and hand-holding are allowed. The goal is to create and deepen personal intimacy and not short circuit the growth of genuine friendship with inappropriate physical intimacy. Certainly, many of us who are now married wish we would have had this type of book in hand years ago. It would have saved many a lot of needless confusion and trouble. You can find a more detailed review at my blog."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"I agree with an earlier review that the subject matter is for mature audiences, but I believe that with the bombardment of sexual messages in our culture that this is appropriate for older teens who are eager to \\"date\\" and have boyfriends or girlfriends. It is really almost too late once they leave for college to have a strong influence.This is the type of book that my mother would have read first and then given to me for reading and later discussion during my teen years. I think that it could open lines of communication between a teen and a parent of the same gender. If responsible adults won't provide the answers to their questions then teens will ask each other or turn elsewhere for information. I was surprised that this book actually tackled some very specific issues that teens in my parish high school program have brought up in (single sex) discussion groups such as what the church teaches is appropriate in marital relations and before marriage."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"I recently purchased this book and have found it refreshingly liberating. The author presents a traditional and healthy Catholic alternative to the dominant method that governs heterosexual relationships today. It preserves the dignity and of both sexes while it provides relatively simple, sense-filled and respectful (Christian) ways to approach perhaps the most important relationship you will have in this world."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"Father Morrow wrote an excellent guide for anyone trying to live a chaste life. At times his phrases seem a bit comical or out-of-date, but his message is essential to anyone looking for a fulfilling relationship and his \\"rules\\" for maintaining one are strict but so wise. I would strongly recommend this book to people who are struggling to live the Church's teaching on chastity, and have actually done so to several of my friends, who also found the book helpful in the extreme."},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"Fr. Morrow's book is by far the best courtship guide for Catholics in print! Steve Wood's THE ABC'S OF FINDING A GOOD WIFE/HUSBAND books are good as supplements and Jason Evert's IF YOU REALLY LOVED ME is great as a primer for Teens and Chastity, but Fr. Morrow has written a book filled with deep insights and advice for faithful Catholic's looking to establish healthy and holy relationships. Fr. Morrow, who I've met mersonally, has changed my life through his work. I used to hold very pessemistic views about myself and relationships, after going through Fr. Morrow's book, I have a renewed outlook and a more real trust in God's plan for my life. This book should be required reading for young single Catholics. Parents, BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR TEENS!

The reason I bought it is because as a new convert I felt like I needed some Catholic advice about such a serious subject. This book did not disappoint, and frankly this book changed my life. After reading it I started to implement changes in my dating habits. Not only changes in my habits, but my whole attitude and mindset about dating changed as well. It helped me to fully understand and appreciate the Holy Sacrament of Marriage in a way no one had ever taught me before. What a wake-up call, and what a blessing! After reading (and re-reading) the book I started to live a more God-centered dating life, and very soon after I met the man God meant for me to be with! We are now married and joyfully awaiting the arrival of our first child. Anyone who is considering the vocation of marriage should read this book and seriously ponder its advice. This is certainly one of the best books for any serious-minded young (and not-so-young) Catholic to read.I am a success story of a young woman who read this book and reaped the benefits of the wisdom it had to offer.Like I said before, this book changed my life, Deo Gratias!"},{"Title":"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World: A Guide for Catholics","review":"This is an excellent resource for parents who seek to teach their children how to court rather than \\"date\\".

The result was this book.It starts out with a bang in the first chapter, when, after sneaking out of the house from a nap with his mother, he is cornered by a homeless bum/pedophile whose attempt to abuse him is aborted by an attack from Paulsen's mother, and it appears that she also killed him. Further chapters decribe him witnessing his mother getting drunk numerous times, having sex with various men, traveling by car and boat to the Phillipines, witnessing shark attacks on passengers escaping from a plane that fell in the sea, watching a man get cut in half by a piece of corrugated iron during a typhoon in the Phillipines, among others.

Some of his books like Dogsong, Hatchet,(WHICH I THINK EVERONE HAS READ) Woodsong, and Christmas Sonata. The pictuers in the book are different. He writes about living in the Philippines.

I will also suggest reading the following books in addition to Clark's work: \\"Kings or People. Power and the Mandate to Rule\\" by Reinhard Bendix; \\"Myths of Power.

I appreciate the author's perspectives on how &quot;work on oneself&quot; helps contribute to the world; so often personal work and social action are seen as separate and even conflicting. The exercises found throughout are easy to do on one's own, or with others in a group.I also recommend the accompanying audiotape/journal called &quot;Growing Whole: Exploring the Wilderness Within.&quot;"},{"Title":"Growing Whole: Self-Realization on an Endangered Planet","review":"In \\"Growing Whole\\" Molly Brown does a good job of summarizing the key elements of psychosynthesis as developed by Roberto Assagioli. She explains the essentials and shows how one can apply it to various aspects of life immediately.This book is written in a simple, straightforward manner and has lots of useful exercises. Many of these exercises build on each other and they use the power of art to access the unconscious. However, you don't need to be an artist to benefit from the drawing exercises; they are more about exploring the psyche through non-verbal means.In my opinion, psychosynthesis is an underrated tool for personal growth. It is offers a very optimistic, practical and transpersonal model that makes sense. Roberto Assagioli was a psychiatrist and he was respected by Freud and Jung. However, he was very open-minded and integrative. Therefore, this area did not develop into a very formal school with clearly delineated boundaries. That's my only explanation for why it is not more popular.Psychosynthesis encourages being curious about your own process, working with sub-personalities which are conceptually very similar to Jungian complexes and using lots of visualization, active imagination and drawing techniques to get at one's depth.One of the more interesting aspects of psychosynthesis is the concept of having repressed areas of the superconscious or higher reaches of the psyche. I think Assagioli has a lot in common with Jung, but in some ways his typology of the psyche is easier to work with in a practical way.My guess is a lot of people who read this book will rate it a five and wonder why I rated it a four. My answer is that it could have contained more meat and some people might find that they want to know more after reading it. If you fall in that category of reader, I would try to get a copy of Psychosynthesis by Assagioli and branch out from there. Piero Ferrucci and John Firman are also respected authors that write about psychosynthesis."},{"Title":"Growing Whole: Self-Realization on an Endangered Planet","review":"In &quot;Growing Whole&quot;, Molly Young Brown offers the reader her wisdom, experience and guidance, rooted in the traditions of psychosynthesis and the awakening concern for our planetary environment. This book is a practical, insightful and spiritual &quot;mentor&quot; for a person's journey toward Self-realization. This well written guide is filled with exercises which provide a productive and enlightened model for personal transformation and ultimately leads us to &quot;bring our gifts into action in the world&quot;. I highly recommend reading and using this book along with the audio tape companion journal also by the author (Exploring the Wilderness Within)--effective resources for &quot;those who yearn to make a difference&quot;."},{"Title":"Life is tough and then you graduate: The second Piled Higher and Deeper Comic Strip Collection","review":"I didn't know of the existence of this comic strip until Jorge Cham came to Georgia Tech... I think two years ago or so. Well, since then, I am a fan of it. I have, up to now (11/07) all the books he has published, and they have given me and some of my friends, countless hours of laughter.As I said when I rated the first book of the series, it's great humor, though, not for everyone. But if you have been in grad school for at least a couple of years in your life, I bet you will enjoy it all through."},{"Title":"Life is tough and then you graduate: The second Piled Higher and Deeper Comic Strip Collection","review":"It's fantastic to see several situations of your grad student life in this comic. Jorge Cham continue to express the voice of thousands master and phd students who claim for freedom and wonder if there are something more in life than studies, papers, conferences, computers and free food.About the text you can find more of the usual: advisors exploiting students (i.e. professor Smith and the nameless student), life in the laboratory, Tajel and her protests, Cecilia with her chocolates, I, Grad Student and The Thesis Zone (phd parodies of I, Robot and the The Twilight Zone), and a lot of things about Mike including his life in procastination, free food, a way to sleep in the lab, and finally his Thesis Defense."},{"Title":"Life is tough and then you graduate: The second Piled Higher and Deeper Comic Strip Collection","review":"I have the whole collection and I like it a lot, overall. But this particular volume is not recommended.The book centers Mike's character who, in my experience, is not the typical grad student. I could not identify with his plights and behaviors. He is exceptionally lazy and sleepy. I do not think a person like that could survive in real grad school, but the unfunny jokes about his experiences occupy 85% of this book. I can relate much better to themes like Cecilia's frustration with grading and her relationships with her family and enjoy the depiction of Prof. Smith's interactions with his overworked and never prepared student. However, these themes were undeveloped in this volume. Overall, I therefore found this book not funny and not insightful. Other books, particularly the 4th volume, are much more on target and resonate with what grad school experience was for me."},{"Title":"Life is tough and then you graduate: The second Piled Higher and Deeper Comic Strip Collection","review":"this is simply hilarious and a great stress relief for grad students of any discipline."},{"Title":"Life is tough and then you graduate: The second Piled Higher and Deeper Comic Strip Collection","review":"Hello,Ce bouquin est g&eacute;nial, pareil que le num&eacute;ro 1.Go ahead, buy it !"},{"Title":"Life is tough and then you graduate: The second Piled Higher and Deeper Comic Strip Collection","review":"Can't think of any reason to keep this book.

If you are not in that category of the struggling in need of ego-stroking, then you probably won't be interested. Firstly, it is not funny. After a few pages we get it: grad students are overworked, tired, poor, and mostly geeks seeking dates. How is that different than the life of undergrads? Ok, grad students have an awkward relationship with professors (who don't even know their names and use them as slaves) and under-grads (who consider them authority figures) which gives the grad students an odd mental complex. No much real humor here. Unless you count references to how supposedly great the weather is presumably in Palo Alto which is not really that good compared to southern California.

There's also the spouse of the PhD canditate, the long-suffering Pht (Putting him/her through).If you're in grad school, this is your life.

Everybody may know that there is online version of it. But it's nice to have your own hard copy and you can flip through it whenever you want.

Much as Dilbert captures such absurdities in the workplace, Jorge captures absurdities in the life of a few average grads. The boss is replaced by the advisor.

And it's something to be survived. It is an apprenticeship, in every sense of the word. And let's not forget that being an apprentice to HIS BROTHER made Ben Franklin run away from home.As I read through the strips, it's easy to see different aspects of my own time in grad school, whether it's the pile of grading, the (seemingly) carniverous undergrads, the long hours, the lack of a life outside of the lab. But it's all there.It's important to remember, that it DOES end, one way or the other.

There's always some Far Side or Dilbert cartoon that just seems to strike a chord with your work, like it was written for you. If you're in graduate school, every single strip by Jorge Cham is like that. Strips from this book are printed out and stuck on the walls of my lab, and every other lab in my neuroscience department for that matter. Not only is this stuff funny, but it's so painfully real, and it helps to know that the struggles we face are shared by the rest of the graduate world, regardless of their discipline.

In conducting research, I was looking for clear, substantive definitions of complexity theory as it applies to social systems. Byrne lays a foundation with distinctions about chaos, complexity, non-linear relationships, and agency. Byrne discusses the limitations of reductionistic science, as well as mathematics as a language of modeling, not as ultimate truths. For students who are seeking a good grounding in the applications of complexity theory to social science issues, Byrne offers perspective for several social systems such as cities (communities), health care, education, pulic policy, and governance. On the whole the book is balanced between scholarly theory and practice."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"Some sections of this book have been very helpful, while others seem to have been slapped together for \\"completeness\\" but without much thought or care. For example the section on session handling I thought was quite good. The section covering the newer object based MySQL interface was hard to understand and lacked enough information to do anything beyond the very basic example given. Then again most books on the shelves right now don't cover it at all.I found numerous errors in the examples, but that seems to be standard fare for most rushed-to-print books of this type. A larger problem is that the text is often unclear, and the examples don't do a good job of helping. Also where there are multiple approaches given to a problem the examples seem to stick to one approach and other approaches, while mentioned, are not shown.It's easy to accept these shortcomings as it seems to be the norm for this type of book, except that after spending some time looking through other books on the subject I did find one that does a much better job on all fronts. No surprise it's an O'Reilly release - \\"Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL 2nd Edition.\\"As to whether I'd recommend this book...not as a sole source of information. It does have some good sections that are worth having access to, but trying to use it by itself to learn with and as a reference has been an exercise in frustration."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"this guide speaks in laymens terms and teached using simple examples.

A lot of technical writers have a tendency to get so bogged down with details they leave the readers behind and frustrated. What Jason does is present the material in a fresh and CONCISE fashion. He doesn't spend paragraph after paragraph beating a subject to death or flinging out stale descriptors; he simply breaks it down into the basic components and tags on \\"nuggets of wisdom\\" that help you avoid pitfalls as he builds on the material. Right from the beginning, he engages us with the why and what of programming PHP against a MySQL backend, and then he's off and running. No long-winded chapters, just straightforward information.

This book is much better as a reference than an intro to PHP, however, even there it has its limitations.I bought this book, read the first 5 chapters (130 pages), and then stopped reading it because I was learning too slowly (ie, reading too many pages and picking up too little usability). As an introductory text, I would rather this book moved at a greater breadth but less depth -- it goes through dozens of specific functions, making it feel like a dictionary. There is also little attention brought to the functions you will be using soon over the ones you will not use for awhile yet. In that sense, it was very frustrating to spend a lot of time reading several chapters and still not feeling like I was getting anywhere or able to use much of the power of PHP.In my frustration, I decided to revisit w3schools . com, and I found their tutorial immensely useful as an introduction to both PHP and MySQL (I needed both and I needed them quickly). That choice allowed me to start writing some PHP code within an hour and start working with databases quickly as well (nothing is mentioned about MySQL until Chapter 24 of this book).So now, instead of use this PHP/MySQL book as a learning tool, I use it as a reference. The index isn't ideal*, so it still isn't a great reference, and the MySQL layout has not been helpful. I will be buying some PHP cookbooks to get a better feel for the capabilities of PHP and how to use its functions properly, and I will report back in this review after I find a better reference to recommend over this one (hopefully by mid-January).*The index is HUGE, but I still have a difficult time finding things I need since I look for a lay-word over the word that is listed. If I already knew the word that is listed in the index, I may not even need to look in the index.This book was written for new programmers that want a programming introduction to PHP and was not written for web programmers new to PHP. Although I program, I want features of a web programming book when I buy a web programming book.What I consider a feature of a (good) web programming book: Chapters are split into a quick intro to the most commonly used fuctions of the chapter's topic (5-10 pages) and a longer part for use as a reference (15-20 pages). The book's format has good eye catching sections so readers do not waste time finding what is important if we just want to skim things so we can get into doing some web programming quickly. Commonly used functions are not buried in a bunch of uncommonly used functions."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I really don't get the high praise for this book; other than the fact that most of the reviewers have programming experience already. I really think that book is way overated and, despite the claims of the title, is not suited for the beginner or the novice.This book includes example code snipets about the use of individual functions, but does not have larger projects or exercices demonstrating how to bring things together.Once I realized this, I thought, \\"well at least I can use it as a reference.\\" And it does succeed at this to some extent. However, even in this capacity it seems a little shollow. Further, one gets the impression that it is basically a rewording of the existing documentation that is already available with PHP and MySQL.To give just one example of all the above... Chapter 2 talks about configuration options in the php.ini file - PHP basics aren't even covered until Chapter3. Anyhow, let me open randomly to one of the excepts from the book and compare it to the .ini file:-----------register_long_arrays(On, Off)Scope: PHP_INI_SYSTEM; Default value: offThis directive determines whether to continue registering the various input arrays (ENVIRONMENT, GET, POST, COOKIE, SYSTEM) using the deprecated syntax, such as HTTP_*_VARS. Disabling this directive is recommended for performance reasons.-----------And a cut and paste from the .ini:Whether or not to register the old-style input arrays, HTTP_GET_VARS and friends. If you're not using them, it's recommended to turn them off,for performance reasons.register_long_arrays = On-----------Again, at this pointt in the book (Chap2) a beginner/novice is still coming to grips with PHP basics (Chap3), let alone Arrays (Chap 5). Even after which, this is cryptic at best. How is this remotely geared towards either the 'beginner' or the 'novice'?! I could go on and on with examples from all parts of the book.The sections on MySQL and the integration between it and PHP is thick, but lite. I consider this book mainly a rehash of the vendor documentation and lacking in real tutorials that are often crutial for novices to learn new skills. And, again, i think that the the book is completely mistitled.Normally, I really like the Apress books; however, in this case I am benefiting much more from Wrox and Sams.I might have given it a 3... but so many others scored it to high - even those who remarked on some of the same things.-My 2 cents"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"This book shouldn't be advertised as \\"from novice to professional\\", since it start assuming that you have pretty complex knowledge of C++, HTML, etc. The book doesn't even have an ordered structure: when you are in the first chapters, it start using functions that will be explained later, just as if you should know them before.Sometimes very complex, other times it just seems like a big appendix of functions descriptions instead as a guide to use them in real program environment.After reading the whole book, and having it at sight, I tried to create a simple program and it was just impossible, because I learned useless and too complex functions but I couldn't make the simplest program without looking for help at php forums.It may be a good option for not-novice, but if you're looking for a novice book, DON'T buy this book."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"This book is geared for three types of readers I believe (a rarity among books). First are people who have no experience in programming or web development whatsoever, the second are people who have worked in other languages whether be on the desktop or the web, the third type are people who already have some basic PHP and/or MYSQL experience and want to further their knowledge into intermediate topics. How can a book accommodate so many types of readers? Well, being slightly over 800 pages helps and also this book is very well written and organized and focuses on all the important topics.It's basically split into three parts (even though it does not say it specifically). The first part comprises of basic PHP skills (installing, syntax basics, functions, OOP and regular expressions), the second part are intermediate to advanced topics (PEAR, authentication, networking, web services, SQLite and PDO) and the third part covers the basics and some intermediate topics of MYSQL (installing, data types, MYSQL and mysqli extensions, stored procedures, triggers, views and transactions).The book basically covers everything you need to know about PHP and MYSQL for most of your needs. Unless your going to be writing large, enterprise applications on a daily basis (most of us will not be), it really is the only book you should need.If you're a novice, don't be scared of the size of the book or how many topics it covers. The author assumes no prior knowledge and starts you from the very beginning with easy to understand examples that step you through everything you need to get going. It covers the latest version of PHP (version 5.1) which includes PDO (PHP Data Objects) which provides a data abstraction layer to help connect to other database other than MYSQL (DB2, SQL Server, ORACLE, etc.) , and built-in functions for database commands.This is a book I highly recommend and should be in your library if you want to learn PHP and MYSQL effectively."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I am a semi-experienced programmer, majoring in CS and currently in my third year. I needed to buy a book to learn PHP for a job and originally went for O'Reilley's _Learning PHP and MySQL_. I quickly realized that was a bad choice, however, because it was way too simple and short and didn't really cover SQL at all. Even as a reference book it just did not suffice compared to Gilmore's _PHP5 and MySQL_ which I borrowed from a friend. PHP and MySQL is covered in great depth, and a thorough index makes this nearly-exhaustive text a great reference book.**This is likely not a book for someone who has never programmed before** as it uses typical programming language terminology without previous definition. Still, abundant examples and side notes allows anyone with reasonable programming experience to breeze through the book. Reading this cover-to-cover would definitely not be the correct approach, but skimming over the chapters and getting acquainted with the PHP language is something this book makes easy to do when you can simply slow down and go over the examples when you feel you need to, or quickly reach the next section thanks to good organization and text formatting.If you are looking for a reference book for PHP and MySQL just short of a bible, this is definitely for you. But if you are a complete novice to programming, you would probably be better off coming back to this later or buying it on the side for once you have more experience."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"Despite the title, this book is not for the novice. Even the introductory first 100 pages or so assume that you are above a novice level. The examples lead to more questions (for me, the novice) than they answer.Having said that, this book has a tremendous amount of information in it and, as other reviews mention, it will work well as a reference. Now, I hope to find a true beginning PHP book to provide the basis to use this book!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I've been a PHP programmer for a few years now. I picked up this book (1) to find a good book for people new to PHP and (2) to introducte me to some of the new features of PHP 5. In my opinion, this book does both very well. While it is good to approach this book with some knowledge of programming concepts already under your belt, the book does serve as a good starter guide to PHP. It starts with the basics and builds from there. The overview of the material is excellent, and the chapters on MySQL cover the MySQL features most likely to be useful to PHP programmers.The biggest fault I have with this book are numerous errors in the writing. The editors should have given the book one more good read-through. The code itself tends to be good, it's the explanations that sometimes don't match the code. The errors tend to be pretty minor and the alert reader won't have any problem realizing the mistake. Still, my wife has gotten tired of my exclamations of, \\"Here's another one!\\"On the whole a great book that does what it claims to do. I have already recommended this book to others and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I bought this book because I had a project that required me to set up a dynamic website driven by MySQL and PHP. Using what I learned in the book and a few free online tutorials I was able to finish the project 1 month early.This book assumes some prior programming experience, so if you've never programmed getting an intro to programming book would be a good idea first. There are many examples of code in the book which cover many things you might like to do with a website driven by these two technologies. Not a terribly difficult read with lots of info."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"First off, this book is completely useless to you if you have do not have adequate OOP programming background. It jumps around different topics and does not really explain why things are arranged a certain way. This book pretty much assumes you have knowledge of either C, C#, Java techniques - which makes PHP extremely easy to understand. If HTML is all you have under your belt, this is probably a terrible book to buy.Coming from an adequate background, this book introduces plenty of useful features of PHP and offers a good guide for reference and parameters. Since the book is titled PHP and MySQL, it is expected that the reader should know basic SQL syntax to understand how PHP works with a database.Overall, this is a good starter book on a very broad topic and it has gotten me started on writing my own scripts."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"This is as it states for the Novice to the Professional and that is completely true.If you are new to PHP or if you know PHP well this book is for you. Great for beginnersand a reference for the professional to turn to again and again.The foundation of the web is simple database back ends and interactive web page front ends.MySQL is an Internet standard back end database and it's ease of use combined with the power of PHPmake the 2 a great combination to construct web databases easily and powerfully.Gilmore guides the reader step by step from installation to basic functions, and finally to practical usesfor PHP and MySQL.But wait a minute, Gilmore adds two more things. He sneaks small chapters in the middle of his book onSqlLite and PDO. For those thinking that MySQL is a bit too much for their small project then turn to SqLite.Gilmore explains how to install and use SqLite quickly. If you are a programmer and are familuar with usingMicrosoft's ADO for database connections, then you can turn to PDO (PHP Dataobjects). PDO provides thepower and simplicity to connect to various databases that you may have at your disposal.One of the great sections in the book is Gilmore's explanation of how to do Object Orientated Programingin PHP. Starting with PHP 5 you can harness the power of PHP to deal with you program objectively. ObjectOrientated Programming is mentally the way to go as you can plan, organize, and assemble your code logically.Other chapters of interest include how to effectively use Arrays, Authentication, File Uploads, PHP and LDAP,Secure PHP, Securing MySQL, Practical Database Queries, and Importing and Exporting data.If you do any work with PHP at all, be sure to check out this book.

I've done some simple PHP previously, and for a project at work I needed to ramp up my knowledge of using PHP together with MySQL. Due to the ratings for this book, I ordered it.It's fairly well written, but the code snippets themselves occasionally have syntax errors. This extends to the source code that you can download from their site. I can understand syntax or other errors in a book, but I can't forgive errors in a file that is easy to update online. In fact, it got so bad that I had to look online through some tutorials to get the syntax correct for my project, defeating the purpose of me purchasing this book.While providing a solid understanding (If somewhat terse at times) of the workings and background of both software packages, error checking needs to come into play."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I was a beginer at PHP and MySql when I bought this book.

I have a background in programming, and I just needed a book to cement together all the concepts I had picked up in developing PHP apps. Less then 2 chapters in the errors became so frequent in the code that the author no longer holds my confidence.

I've been using & tweaking PHP applications for a few years, and recently had occasion to build one. The fact that this book could also refresh my MySQL skills peaked my interest.I was impressed with the nice examples, long enough to show the main idea, yet other reviewers are right, there is not much here in the way of fullout precanned applications.I like that this book seems to be organized so that rather than just read it from cover to cover you can dive in and learn from any particular section. The examples can can be downloaded from the Apress site. At times, when printed examples left details out it would be nice if those details would be included in the down-loadable examples (.css files are used in the HTML_Table demos, but never shown or down-loadable).After browsing the MySQL sections I was able to create and manipulate the db I wanted in no time.This book covers lots of ground, I was impressed with the completeness of PHP topics, including things you might not expect, like Smarty templates and the Data abstraction of PDO.Contrary to other reviews, this book is still not a complete PHP reference manual, it's not meant to be. But if you have this book and a link to a PHP reference website you'll be fine!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"Being brand new to PHP, I found it very helpful to read through the primer this book offers on PHP basics to get my footing. From there, I have used the book as a reference to solve particular problems, such as setting up a module for uploading files from a client to my web server or using PHP to send emails from your site.The book is very well written, clear and to the point, but with enough elaboration to keep you interested. Works well as either a reference or a read-through.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I found this to be a very helpful guide in getting into the intense details of configuration, performance tuning and eventually programming PHP web applications.

Jason Gilmore. The technical editor was Matt Wade, founder of CodeWalkers, a great PHP and MySQL resource site. It is the Second Edition follow-up to PHP 5 and MySQL. Since I've already written a review of the First Edition, I will try to mainly focus on the changes to the second version of the book, which cover some of the newer features in each of the technologies.At the initial time of printing for the first book, many PHP 5 features were only in the beta version, and MySQL 5 was still in alpha testing. Now, eighteen months later, they have solidified into what has become quite a formidable enterprise solution for server-side scripting and database storage.There has been quite a bit of extra material covered this time around, to the tune of 177 additional pages. In fact, by comparison the new edition is noticeably heavier than its predecessor. The existing chapters have also been revised, with XHTML examples being given in most cases instead of HTML, as well as minor changes to some of the updated / deprecated syntax.A total of seven new chapters have been added, further enriching what was already a great resource. One of the more interesting subjects covered is the new mysqli() extension. It is encapsulated into a class, allowing you to access a database more easily than the older, procedural method. It also offers an object oriented interface for handling transactions, adding code efficiency.Aside from offering informative chapters, there are also several good tutorials, such as creating a mortgage calculator which will compute accumulated interest over time. Another cool one was a how-to on rendering a dynamic tabular calendar by using a PEAR package and less than 30 lines of actual code.I could go on and on, but if you really want to dig into this powerful open-source combo, you're going to have to read the book for yourself. By the author's own admission, \\"this isn't a romance novel,\\" but if you don't mind some heavy reading this could be right up your alley. Happy hypertext pre-processing!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"This is a great reference book. It delves very deep into both PHP and MySQL. One thing I found lacking was some context. Practical examples so that I can see what I've learned being implemented in real world applications.Other books that do not get so deep often include these types of exercises and I find them extremely helpful to gain a true understanding of the material.In my opinion, if this book included excerises, case studies, etc.. it would be perfect."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"it's thick really.

And like some say, it's implementation to a website and turorial is little or near to zero.Should include more samples of cases. you have to figure out your own. it's more like a textbook than a self-learn book. It's good for reference. I suggest who is really new ,in PHP - look for other that is easier to read ,and more novice-like.This book should help in your advance to professional stage."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"First off let me address a common review, that the book is too advanced for beginners. Plain and simple, it is not beginning programming, it's beginning PHP and MySQL. To even know what these applications are, you should have some programming background anyhow.That said, even if you don't have any prior experience, the book does a great job of introducing you to the key concepts, and is flooded with examples, the best way to learn.This book has become my programming bible, but it maintains a great balance. It has everything you could ever wish to look up later (and you will), but still follows a nice rhetoric and flow for someone looking for a tutorial-esque book. Some of the examples he wrote are key frameworks in my website! I actually used his book as my main source to build my website from the ground up. Even if it doesn't have something, it arms you with enough knowledge to know the right questions to ask. Which leads me to the greatest part of all... he backs his product!I battled a bug for over 4 months that I was unable to solve from searching anywhere on the Internet. It's then I remembered that he listed his E-Mail address in the book and challenged readers to contact him if they needed help! Not expecting a response, I was shocked when he speedily replied that day, and solved my problem finally to boot!To sum up: Not necessarily for beginners period, great for programmers beginning PHP and MySQL, the only book you should have to buy, and a very supportive author."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"First, let me say this book DOES NOT teach programming. So, if you are unfamiliar with general programming constructs and how they work, this book may not be for you.This is my first book on PHP and MySQL. I have read many other books ranging from simple web development to game programming with OpenGL and C++. For anyone with some understanding of programming this is an excellent book. It is one of the easiest reads for a technical book that one can find.The book is full of short examples. The book does not unnecessarily spend a long time on particular commands and gets straight to the point. For example, the chapter on arrays does not go over what an array is and how it operates, but discusses a huge plethora of array functions. This makes the book a great reference, as the chapters are independent and well organized. This also means the 913 pages are packed with a wealth of information; especially since, there is not an appendix.The author is also very approachable, and he has responded to my e-mail. He also has a new site for the book that I recommend you visit before making your decision. [...]This book is definitely a good choice if you are looking for a book to learn PHP and use it with the MySQL database."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I picked up about three different books on the subject, and this one was by far the best. It moved at a fairly rapid pace, but each example was explained fairly thoroughly. The past couple of years I haven't had much luck with computer books; some were either a little too slow (PHP Visual Blueprint-- but at least the examples worked) and/or extremely sloppy (Designing with Javascript from O'Reilly is a prime example-- demo files from the website either didn't work or were missing entirely-- and the errata page didn't even begin to address these problems) or presented haphazardly (Elizabeth Castro's Peachpit book on Perl). I was really glad to find this book when I did. I was about to give up on computers entirely and turn to some disreputable vocation like war profiteering."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"[This review refers to the second edition.]A beginning PHP book, not a beginning programming book. The subtitle, 'From Novice to Professional', can be a tad misleading for the novice coder. A beginning programming book covers a lot of material that this book assumes the reader already understands. Many software books include a 'Who Is This Book For' section that offers some guidance on the suitable reader knowledge level, not this one.That said, I found this book to be very helpful. The sections on installing and configuring Apache, PHP and MySQL certainly saved me many hours of reading the online documentation and tweaking of settings while setting up my local test bed. That, in itself, made me a very happy camper. The author goes on to cover the various aspects from the basics of the PHP language and class libraries to topics like Authentication, Security, Session Handlers and eMail functionality that help anyone new to PHP setup some fairly sophisticated site capabilities.The second edition has been supplemented with an added 200 pages, including a new section on PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository). This is a wealth of prewritten classes and packages that can be used to add even more sophisticated functionality to the novice's web development toolbox. The author demonstrates several of the more prominent packages.The second edition has greatly beefed up with additional coverage of MySQL 5, including chapters on stored procedures, triggers and the PHP mysqli extension (all missed in the first edition). Most of the examples offered are clean and general enough to be useful templates for the reader's tailoring.My suggestion for novices to PHP is read through chapter 9, then skip to the various sections that solve specific problems being faced or are of particular interest, including installing and configuring your local test bed.Bottom line, the first edition was a good book for intermediate to veteran programmers looking for a quick tutorial on PHP (circa version 5.0); the second edition is even better. Novice programmers should ensure that they have a full understanding of the basics of programming (and OOP) before attempting it. I would now use this book to teach a class on PHP.P-)"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I never got around to finishing this book because halfway through it I noticed I had not even written a single line of code.The author does not propose any excercises for you to try out what your learned through the book.All he does is list all the functions available in PHP but no examples on how to use them.I can see this book being useful as a reference after you have programmed PHP for a while, but for beginners that want to get started in PHP for the very firt time I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"Had a few bumps with the installation, actuall contacted the author through email and he took the time to help and point me in the right direction.

For the first exam I used the recommended study materials: the semi-official guide written by Zend and a third-party guide. Now the exam itself is poorly constructed, but even a bad exam can be prepared for. Yet my dedicated exam guides proved to be moderately useful at best. The Zend book was particularly bad - a confusing jumble of topics that was too simplistic and did not adequately cover the exam material. I threw the Zend book in the trash, sold the other, and purchased Gilmore's PHP5 and MySQL5. Long story short, I confidently passed the exam the second time.As a side note, I don't know why anyone applied \\"Beginning\\" to the title. After the first 6 or 8 chapters this book is probably more Intermediate-level. True Beginners may wish to read O'Reilly's latest PHP guide, which is quite excellent for learning the basics of PHP. Regardless, Gilmore's style is clear and strong enough that even Beginners can make it through. I am certainly no expert, and I am able to follow along with everything given his good examples and some time to re-read difficult passages.Well done, Jason, and thank you!"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional","review":"I purchased this book because I needed to use PHP and MySQL for a project at work. I never had any exposure to either before reading this book. By using this book and the w3schools website I was able to successful build a meager database and have a fully functioning php front end. It was very pleasing to see the project come to fruition and I have this book to thank for that. I used it mainly as a reference book. For example, I knew exactly what I wanted to do so I would search this book for an example of that and adapt the code to my situation. I didn't use this book to \\"learn PHP.\\" I think you need to have a project to do in order to best use this book."},{"Title":"IT COULD STILL BE A BUTTERFLY","review":"This book is about butterflies and caterpillars. It is a non-fiction, very good learning book. This is a great book for kids because it is educational, and it shows how things change from one thing, to another. It shows the 4 different stages. This book has beautiful photographs, and is easy to read. I have read this book and I liked it. If you read it, you will probably like it too."},{"Title":"Saltwater, Sweetwater: Women Write from California North Coast","review":"This collection of writing by so many talented individuals is truly a treasure. Many of the stories make some reference to the geography of Northern California, giving those who know it a thrill of recognition. But even for those who have never even heard of the small towns and backroads of the North Coast, this book is refreshing and engrossing. I would highly recomend this book to anyone in any part of the world.Dedicated to the memory of Judi Bari and Suzanne Lipsett, two influential women fallen to breast cancer, many of the pieces have a theme of death or departure. Some may leave you crying, but all are superbly constructed works of art worthy of the highest recognition."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"At the urging of a friend, I read this book expecting only to find things of interest to musicians. Instead, I learned easily mastered techniques for centering and focus that are useful for my non-musical life. And as for my life as a lay listener, it is forever changed by my new knowledge, compliments of Ms Elson's easy prose, of the many skills beyond those at the keyboard that a musician must develop - and CAN develop - to become an accomplished performer. A fascinating read."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"Margret Elson, in her book, Passionate Practice, has provided a step-by-step, well-organized guide for all musicians who are interested in improving their practice and performance. She includes thorough instructions for gaining necessary relaxation, techniques for developing focused concentration, and a helpful procedure to tackle even the most difficult spots successfully. Her encouraging and thoughtful method can be applied from the beginning of learning a piece to its accomplished performance and always with the aim of personal musical expressivity. Delightful cartoons illustrate many of Ms. Elson's points and, together with her handy checklists, this book is both practical and insightful."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"This is a typical self-help book: a lot of \\"therapy\\", that is to say mystifying nonsense and psychobabble. I had my suspicions immediately upon getting to the Introduction page: here we have an epigraph from one \\"Guru Nanak The First Sikh Guru\\"; goes like this [capitalisation preserved]: \\"Divine Music is heard in every soul, Continuous, resonant, self-sustaining\\". Boy, that's deep, that truly expresses ... something. OK, now, quick to the bibliography at the end: here my suspicions were further augmented by the presence of Coelho and Arundhati Roy among the sources. Intelligent people don't read this kind of stuff. OK, moving on to the bio blurb on the last page: a nice picture of the author here -- and a list of accomplishements worthy of a Benvenuto Cellini, including, among other things, not one, not two, but three Master's degrees -- in Journalism, Political Science, and Psychology. One wonders how this is possible and how meaningful all these are ... and in addition, the book is somewhat poorly written, at least for a Master in Journalism. Strangely, no music degrees are listed; this is unusual for someone teaching music (and who, in addition, had the time to obtain three unrelated Master's degrees).A few specific examples of:(1) Mystifying drivel, p. 27 \\"Picture a point of light at a spot in your abdomen and watch yourself breathing to that spot, lighting it up\\". That's good guidance! -- Deepak Chopra himself couldn't put this better.(2) Strange grammar and usage, p. xiii, \\"As a teacher it became my goal to put all the components [...]\\". I can see HW Fowler spinning in his grave... More of that, p. xv, \\"This book contains the means to free yourself from [...] As you traverse the road ahead, please bring along ...\\". Travel, perhaps? Traverse would mean to cross the road; hardly the intended meaning. Page 41, \\"... notice the minimum amount of energy you need ...\\". Amount can be of sugar, but not of energy -- energy is an abstract noun. Master's in Journalism, huh.(3) The book is full of pseudoscientific and/or cutesy little magic words (very typical for the bs-rich self-help genre) -- \\"Magic Carpet\\", \\"Eight-Point Sensory System\\", \\"Puppy Dog Hands\\", \\"Uh-oh Mindset\\", \\"At-one-With-the-Universe\\" this and that, \\"R/A Response\\", etc.I'm being pedantic, I know.The bottomline:I'm not sure if Regent Press is a vanity publisher, but this book feels self-published. OK, tastes differ, fine: suppose you're curious, so check it out and if you find it helpful, god bless -- but do check it out. New-Age \\"therapeutic\\" types might like it... As for me, it's not enough (charitably) substance and too much formulaic tripe, so I'm sending it back.---PS.

Margret Elson's Passionate Practice succeeds on all three counts. As soon as the book arrived, I began working my way methodically through the various exercises and I found them all easy to understand, if sometimes tricky to do. Elson's humor and straightforward, encouraging language helped me to stay on task. What have I internalized, now that this book is tucked away among my Mozart and Beethoven piano music? A greater awareness of tension in my hands, not only when I'm at the piano, but when I'm talking on the phone or driving. As soon as I notice my hands clenched on the steering wheel, remembering Passionate Practice, I relax them. Ditto for that tough phone call--and when I soften my grip on the handset and breathe, the phone call usually gets easier. I loved Elson's technique for attacking problems with memorization and/or wrong notes when two sections of the music are only slightly different. The short version is that you get into the position of two statues that express the feeling of the two passages, and it's surprising how very different statues One and Two can turn out to be. After practicing my statues away from the piano, I find my knowledge of the music substantially changed when I return to the keyboard. For more detailed accounts of this and other techniques, I recommend you get your own copy of Passionate Practice."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"As someone who has known Ms. Elson for several decades, I can attest to her pianistic artistry and her creative teaching. As an experienced piano teacher myself, I have found her ideas for performance preparation, including practice/preparation techniques and focussing techniques during performance, which draw upon many different sensory resources to be extremely helpful for both me and my students. A number of my students have sworn by it. What I appreciate about Margret is her ability to write a book that is both concise and yet rich in content, easily readable and humorous, yet effective in its step-by-step processes. She practices what she preaches by reaching the reader through many sensory approaches. Anyone who has heard her performances knows that she plays with exquisite taste, style and passion. I highly recommend this thoughtfully written book."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"While the book is clearly titled to attract musicians who aim to hone their practicing and focusing skills, I found this book useful for a completely different reason. When I read it, in place of &quot;learning a piece&quot; I read &quot;speaking in public&quot; and really benefitted from the awareness and focusing techniques that are emphasized. Since the book is an easy read, useful ideas and skills can be extracted by reading just a few paragraphs. On the other hand, the depth of the book, and integral and fundamental role of many of its teachings makes it the kind of book you can learn even more from by going back and reading it again, picking up on things you missed the first time. I recommend this book for people interested in learning new techniques for improving their skills, focus, and confidence. It has a very natural flow that makes it an enjoyable read as well."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"If anyone had told me five years ago that I'd be playing my own recital, I would have doubted their sanity. BUT, by following the guidelines in this book I was able to overcome my deep seated anxieties about performing and actually play an entire program. The recital was a great success and, amazingly, an enjoyable experience for me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who suffers from stage fright. IT WORKS!"},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"Margaret Elson's \\"Passionate Practice\\" has been a source of wisdom and encouragement since I read it when it was first published. I have returned to it many times. Elson's blend of psychotherapeutic expertise with her experience as a musician makes this book helpful to many. The author is a scholar-practitioner whose work with pianists transfers to wisdom for people striving to enhance their vocational expression and freedom. I hope we will be seeing more books from this writer."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"Contrary to what Mr. Schmidt has written, I have to differ that this book is one of those typical \\"new age\\" self-help books. There is real substance and common sense mixed in between the poetic quotes. What people might fail to see is that the author is an artist herself and is passionate about her subject. Rather than write in dry, technical jargon, she illuminates and illustrates her examples with a high degree of wit and philosophical reflection--the very grist we need to persevere in what is an otherwise, daunting artistic process. I have studied piano privately with the author for several years and can tell you that her book is just skimming the surface of what she is actually able to teach in person. The author knows her stuff and produces successful results."},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"This book is fantastic!!

Elson's ideas are original and truly creative. You can't tell from the title but the book has great ideas for dealing with performance problems, specifically physical tension and anxiety. Elson's various exercises and visualizations are smart, very do-able, and they work! I have done them myself and have several of my students doing them, with great success. Where was this book when I needed it, 30 years ago?"},{"Title":"Passionate Practice: The Musician's Guide to Learning, Memorizing, and Performing","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I'm not much of a musician (I play a mean CD player, but that's about it). So, I was surprised when I found myself reading this book and translating a lot of the performance ideas to my athletics and work.While this book is directed towards musicians, many of the techniques for preparing for a performance as well as the general guidelines of the book are applicable for others as well. I encourage you to read this book, not as a guide to how to play the piano, but as a guide to how to prepare for performances of any type."},{"Title":"To Save This Child","review":"Every spring Dr. Jason Bridges closes his office for three weeks, heading to the remote jungles of Chiapas, Mexico where he offers his medical skills to the natives. Despite the hectic schedule and primitive conditions, Jason achieves something akin to redemption in his service to these needy people. Through the years of service, his staff has become as hooked on the experience as the doctor himself, and none of them ever want to leave. But when a last minute medical emergency sidelines his translator, Jason turns unexpectedly to pharmaceutical representative Kendal Collins for help.During the lonely year since Phillip dumped her, Kendal has gone from top earning drug rep to the bottom of the heap. Without Phillips added income, her lifestyle has become too expensive to afford, and pity parties an occasional necessity. Determined to do anything to revitalize her flagging career, Kendal agrees to provide her translation skills in return for the opportunity to prove the worth of her company's pharmaceuticals. With his medical reputation, Jason's switch her company's drugs assures Kendal the career boost she needs. The last thing she expects is fall in love with a child in Mexico, let alone the doctor who operates on him.TO SAVE THIS CHILD almost feels like it was placed in the wrong category with its political intrigue, but its heart felt emotions places it squarely in the Superromance series. This powerful medical romance leads Jason and Kedal not only through the dangers of a jungle but also the challenging terrain of the heart. Jason's determination to remain emotional distance cannot endure the onslaught of the intriguing Kendal. The descriptions of the conditions of Chiapas, Mexico and the necessity of drawing lots for medical care provides both a disturbing and a poignant background that lingers in the imagination long after the last page is turned. Powerfully rendered and impossible to put down, TO SAVE THIS CHILD comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"To Save This Child","review":"Though his practice is in Oklahoma City, Dr. Jason Bridges makes trips to Chiapas, Mexico to provide medical assistance to the isolated locals. This year his nurse Kathy Martinez cannot make the trip due to her own medical needs, but obtains an able replacement, Kendal Collins. Jason warns Kendal that she must not become emotionally attached to any of the natives; she understands his caution and includes her new employer too.However that proves easier said than done when Kendal meets two-year-old orphan Miguel. She takes full responsibility for the boy and decides to move heaven, earth and two governments so that she can raise him as her son. Jason finds himself failing to heed his own advice when he too falls in love. He wants to be at Kendal's side raising Miguel.TO SAVE THIS CHILD is an intriguing medical romance with a side dish of flying adventure that is at its best when the plot furbishes insight into the courageous Doctors Without Borders giving medical care to the remote and needy. The story line is fun to follow especially when health care is the center of the plot as it is for the most part. Though the plane incident that sandwiches the adventure seems unnecessary, fans of medical romance will appreciate this warm contemporary tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"The whole series gives the reader an insight to history from early 1700's to 1900."},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"read all 8 and you will feel like a kent yourself...."},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"I have to say this is one of the best of the series so far.

Now on to the last of the series."},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"The Lawless by John Jakes is an excellant book. First for it's faithfulnes to history and second for the ingenious way that Jakes is able to weave a fictional plot into a factual accounting. Reading any of the &quot;Kent Family Chronicles&quot; is like attending the most entertaining American History class ever created. I highly recommend. this title. A reader would be well advised to start at the beginning of the series to avoid missing any of the family sub-plots that keep this book, and the series, so enjoyable. When I was done reading the book I felt that the Kents had become people that I knew and I was sad that I could not continue along with them in their lives."},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"One of the more successful Kent books. The sons of Jephtha Kent -- who is conveniently (and oh too quickly) killed off -- reap what they have sown. The lawless Kent of the title is Jeremiah, the gunslinger-gambler. Jakes cleverly manipulates other members of his cast to come in contact with Jeremiah without knowing who he is; first Julia on her suffragist tour of the Wild West, and then brother Gideon, with tragic results. The travails of Matthew Kent allow Jakes to explore nineteenth-century Paris, but the author is more successful detailing the great Chicago Fire of 1871 and early union uprisings than the Parisian bohemian art world. Gideon Kent's story takes up the bulk of the book: his wife's madness (which I have trouble buying, even though her father was a drunk and alcoholism is supposed to be hereditary), his affair with Julia, his estrangement from his children, his pro-union sympathies, and his conflict with the railroad giant Courtleigh. Gideon's descent into conservatism is less abrupt than Philip Kent's in The Seekers, and therefore more realistic, but equally annoying. The abrupt about-face by Dolly when she decides to leave Matthew seems out of character: I feel like Jakes is setting up her son Thomas to take part in raj activities in India for a future book never written. Eleanor the budding actress is also a believable character, but her last-minute reconciliation with Gideon is even less convincing. The Lawless has less in the way of canvas and sprawl than The Warriors (for instance), and Jakes seems to be truly interested in character development over episode, perhaps for the first time in the series. Unfortunately, none of the characters is as compelling as Amanda Kent in The Furies --and Jakes chooses to relegate the women to a secondary position."},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"maybe my favoite of the 8, it is hard to decide, they are all great and together an awesome read...."},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","review":"This is book seven of the Kent Family Chronicles - I read all of Jakes' books when they were published originally and have bought and am re-reading his entire body of work on my Kindle.

Period insights abound especially in the attitudes of the characters in the pre-and post 13th Amendment period. It's hard to believe that we are but 150 years from the Civil war - and the views of that period exist even today, although somewhat masked by time and education.Jakes is a premier American author and belongs on every avid reader's bookshelf.

Love at first site is really the only type of love he writes about. Some historical people mixed in with the fictional ones; and a look at the Americas of the 1850's to 1900, mostly.The only noteworthy part of this book, is the overall uninteresting characters. None of them really come alive, and one is never in tune with any member of the family (though the book is mostly about Gideon, with a little of Matt, and less of Jeremiah).

We find the USS Jefferson in the North Sea, on a friendly mission with Russia in playing some war games. Tombstone gets evidence while in Russia, that his father is alive in the Ukraine, so he flies to Kursk. Meanwhile, in the North Sea, two to three Russian subs are hunting one of our subs who happend to be on a covert mission that was not explained. So, this book has two scenarios playing out, and is written in first person. Frankly, I would like the author to write in both third and first person, mix it up a little. Although, it is interesting to get the thoughts of the main characters. This book has a couple of good dog fights, but most of the fighting is one-sided and the ending was too quick. Will the next Carrier book pick up where this one left off, or will the Jefferson be in a whole new area. The quest for Tombstone's father apparently ends in this book."},{"Title":"Brink of War (Carrier Naval Aviation Series, 13)","review":"This book, like everything else written by Mr. Douglass, will never find a high place in the history of the written word.

Even though I beliive that Mr. Douglass thinks just a bit too highly of the capabilities of the F-14 when compared to other, more modern fighters, he does tell a fine tale. My only other criticism would be that the author should abandon this story line about his father... it is getting kind of far fetched.

Most of the book is written using some weird phonetic transcription (no IPA here!). A large part of the book is devoted to phonetics by the way.

And it's all done on a budget, a must if you're living as an underemployed bon vivant -- and who isn't these days? The author packs a lot of information into this book with wit and style. His flare for observations about the partying lifestyle made me laugh out loud. The book is worth buying even just for the section on how to throw a party and get free booze out of it -- and for the tips on how to get drunk people out of your apartment!

While you're there, look for freebies or other discounts, but sign up for their e-mail list. The vast majority of messages received will be little better than spam, but there could be the occasional gem with a subject line like, \\"Free admission and free dinner.\\" Forget clothing trends and visit your local thrift shop (the book even tells the best time of the week to visit). There you can buy a few pieces that can be mixed and matched, plus a funky T-shirt or two. Then you can go crazy with accessories.Have you visited your local public library? Aside from books (not just bestseller fiction) they also have CDs, DVDs of classic movies, and talks and lectures on a wide variety of subjects, all for free. Exercising to get rid of your ghostly, all-night-partying skin color, is a really good idea, but you do not have to spend a lot of money joining a gym. An effective, low-tech workout can be done with regular, household objects, but the first step is getting off your butt.In the area of making money, if you have something autographed or unique, sell it on eBay. Focus groups are fun and easy (after you are accepted, which is the hard part), and the pay starts at $25 per hour. Become a house/petsitter, or rent your place for movie shoots and commercials. Have you ever thought of renting yourself as a designated driver for party people, or renting your body to science by taking part in medical research studies?This is a really eye-opening book.

For those more familiar with his novels and prose Book of Blues will open a more pure and raw form of verse than even &quot;On the Road&quot;. Kerouac was truly a poet at heart. To get the full effect of this book which reaaly needs to be read aloud to full experience I also highly recommend Kerouac's Blues &amp; Haikus CD which contains him reading several of the poems in Book of Blues."},{"Title":"Book of Blues","review":"Book of Blues is an important piece of writing that chronicles an important time in Kerouac's life and works well with Desolation Angels. As I read Desolation Angels, I noticed that Jack Duluoz makes references to various works of poetry as he moves through the book and Book of Blues contains many of those poems. Desolation Blues was written about his time on Desolation Peak and accompanies that section of the book well. You begin to understand Jack's thoughts and anxities better. Later Jack is in Mexico City writing Mexico City Blues but he also wrote Orizabo(I believe) at the same time, at least according to Desolation Angels. Orizabo Blues can be seen as the outakes or the preparaton from Mexico City Blues. Later on in the book, Jack Duluoz is back in Mexico City after his trip to Europe and during these times he wrote Cerrera Medellin blues. Other Blues not included in Book of Blues though mentioned in Desolatioin Angels are Washington, D.C. Blues and Tangier Blues which have yet to be published. Book of Blues is an important book to the Kerouac canon."},{"Title":"Book of Blues","review":"this book has so many unique qualities to it, and they all focus so much on Kerouac's unusual lifestyle... the book, with it's so many chouruses is an inspiration!"},{"Title":"Book of Blues","review":"Some of the general points made below have been used in other reviews of books and materials by and about Jack Kerouac.\\"As I have explained in another entry in this space in a DVD review of the film documentary \\"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\\", recently I have been in a \\"beat\\" generation literary frame of mind. I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on Jack Kerouac's lesser non-prose work, the poems under review here, \\"Book Of Blues\\" that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of his better known works dedicated to Lowell's \`bad boy', the \\"king of the 1950s beat writers\\".And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then, \\"On The Road\\", his classic modern physical and literary \`search' for the meaning of America for his generation which came of age in post-World War II , readily comes to mind. No so well known, however, is the fact that that famous youthful novel was merely part of a much grander project, an essentially autobiographical exposition by Kerouac in many volumes starting from his birth in 1922, to chart and vividly describe his relationship to the events, great and small, of his times. Those volumes bear the general title \\"The Legend Of Duluoz\\". Perhaps even less well known are his poetic works, although given his spontaneous writing style method and association with many of the key poets of the 1940s and 1950s, beat or not, it is less understandable. That is why we today, in the year of the forty anniversary of Kerouac's death, are under the sign of a compilation of his poetry, aptly titled, \\"Book Of Blues\\".Kerouac, in a couple of famous essays and in various places in some of his novels, makes a very big point that he was deeply influenced by the rhythm of jazz and by the be-bop language associated with it. Certain passages from \\"On The Road\\" and other works clearly emphasize that point. Although Kerouac was not known as a major beat poet, and will not be remembered as such, he certainly rated as a talented minor one, as these poems, especially \\"San Francisco Blues\\" indicate. It is hard to get a sense, unlike with Allen Ginsberg, of Kerouac's ideas how these poems should \\"sound\\" from merely reading them on the page. But there is a method to the couple of hundred choruses that are included here in various forms broken into several interrelated poems. Let's put it this way, read a couple of Kerouac's books and then come back to this."},{"Title":"Book of Blues","review":"Contains the outstanding 'Desolation Blues'. Otherwise unremarkable"},{"Title":"Book of Blues","review":"I first read Kerouac's writtings over 30 years ago. The content of this work is firm but is limited in it's scope and focus.

As a Canadian who lives in the US, Pipes is able to weigh the pluses and minuses of both systems -- finding more fault in Canada's sclerotic single-payer system, where waiting lists delay patients' access to life-saving treatments, but not giving either system a clean bill of health. I strongly recommend this short, but thorough and anecdote-packed, look at how to fix two great countries' inadequate health care systems."},{"Title":"Miracle Cure: How to Solve America's Health-Care Crisis and Why Canada Isn't the Answer","review":"I love when a writer nails a problem and also recognizes the political and social difficulties we will face in trying to effect the solution. This Pipes has done well. As a young physician, I soon realized that the health of my community depended more on how I VOTED than how well I was trained. Now as a physician of 20 years, I have seen first hand how the current health care system fosters a sense of entitlement to \\"free\\" care with no accountability or responsibility on the part of the consumer(patients): here in the US not Canada! The solution is NOT more of the same government intervention and insulation of patients from their health care decisions. But try telling this to the media, academia or even politicos who are either ignorant of the facts or fearful of their constituents.Should be required reading for all MDs in training."},{"Title":"Miracle Cure: How to Solve America's Health-Care Crisis and Why Canada Isn't the Answer","review":"Interesting that the One-Star reviews below are from people who did not read the book and do not comment on its actual contents.If the writer has a particular viewpoint -- golly, maybe that's what motivated her to WRITE A BOOK. Duh. It would be a pretty bleak literary world if writers were not allowed to have opinions, or to write as a response to their own intellectual motivations.Those of you who'd slam her simply becuase you can verify that her political and economic opinions vary from yours, might actually learn something from considering another viewpoint and indulging in the information that supports that viewpoint.

I used to pay for my health insurance before I moved to canada and now I don't and I get the same care for free!! Plus I get all the name brand drugs if I need them.

I don't know where sally gets her facts from."},{"Title":"Miracle Cure: How to Solve America's Health-Care Crisis and Why Canada Isn't the Answer","review":"People who write books like this get invited to all the right places in this country. The reason is simple. Our system is is only possible medical system. It's not that other systems do not exist - it is that people in our system cannot even IMAGINE that other viable systems exist, must less that they function quite well. We never hear about them except in the negative. Sally Pipes would never be allowed to speak in our system unless she came with a satchel of critcisms of her own system. That was her ticket - that's how she got on stage. There's a pervasive sort of censorship going on here made all the worse because people in this country don't know how pervasive that censorhsip is. We are a free and open and intellectually closed shop.Sally Pipes will hit the forum circuit down here and get invited to all the interview shows. This is because she criticizes the Canadian system. Were she to praise it, she might as well be sitting in an igloo."},{"Title":"Miracle Cure: How to Solve America's Health-Care Crisis and Why Canada Isn't the Answer","review":"If you Google for Pacific Research Institute (Sally Pipes is President and CEO) and browse their offerings, you'll see strong evidence that this organization exists to promote conservative ideas and 'debunk' progressive 'myths' about women's issues, the environment, fairness, health care, globalization, drug importation, etc etc.Here's a blurb from the \\"About\\" section of the PRI site:_______________The mission of the Pacific Research Institute (PRI) is to champion freedom, opportunity, and personal responsibility for all individuals by advancing free-market policy solutions.Since its founding in 1979, PRI has remained steadfast to the vision of a free and civil society where individuals can achieve their full potential.Put simply, public policy is too important to be left just to the experts. Individuals are the real decision makers when it comes to their schools, health care, and environment._______________So take Sally's book with a boulder-sized grain of salt and find other sources of info about Canada's system to supplement your education on the issue. I'm sure it's not perfect (Canadian system), but Sally Pipes has a strong idealogical bent (and conservative connections) that call into question her severe condemnation of the Canadian system.Disclaimer: I have not read the book, but have just heard portions of her lecture at the Commonwealth Club on public radio and was alarmed enough at her horror stories about waiting lists to want to find out more about her background.Oh, and Google Sally Pipes too! You'll turn up plenty of conservative links as well as some links that vigorously contest her characterizations of the Canadian system.Thank goodness for Google and for Amazon comments!"},{"Title":"Reading Japanese Financial Newspapers","review":"I do not recommend this for learning kanji, but only for the word lists (like the sample financial statements at the end) and some of the grammatical points.I've owned this book for ten years or so and never got even half-way thru the first section until I had worked my way thru another, far better book, \\"Business Kanji\\" published by Tuttle in 1999. I am now finally getting thru it, but still don't like it much.Although this book is exhaustively thorough especially regarding grammatical patterns, it relies far to much on brute force memorization. Kanji are introduced and used in no apparent order and are not reinforced once learned.It is perhaps the \\"best\\" for business of an outdated methodology which has been replaced by the far better approaches of Prof. Eleanor Jorden (\\"Reading Japanese\\"--although that doesn't begin to go far enough to read a newspaper), Prof. Edward Daub et al. (\\"Basic Technical Japanese\\" which I have also reviewed very favorably here) and \\"Business Kanji\\" by Reiko Suzuki, et alia."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese Financial Newspapers","review":"Though currently out of print, this textbook from Kodansha is quite excellent and well worth tracking down for students of Japanese eager to reach an advanced level of control in the language. Very few \\"Advanced\\" textbooks really do much to help you with anything other than the specific stories or articles that they provide as examples. \\"Reading Japanese Financial Newspapers,\\" however, is extremely effective at getting the new vocabulary and kanji compounds in your head keeping what you learn in the front of your mind. I am an actor, not a businessman, but this book has helped tremendously in making the leap forward to reading contemporary newspapers, novels, and essays in Japan.That said, this is NOT for the beginner. You must already have a firm grasp of hiragana, katakana, and basic kanji. This textbook will make the difference for those who have mastered basic and have a relatively firm grip on intermediate Japanese. At the beginning you should feel that much of the material is repetition of more vague words that you've already experienced in some capacity. However, the book moves at a very quick pace, cementing those aspects for a strong foundation upon which to gain control of the more advanced language that comes soon after.If you're new to the language or just finished the beginning phase, try another more basic textbook. But for the already fairly experienced Japanese student, this book is more than worth the search."},{"Title":"Confession of Brother Haluin","review":"Hard core Cadfaelians may find this particular story too simple as you can pretty much from the beginning assumes what is about to happen.

In an interview on the DVD of Brother Cadfael - A Morbid Taste for Bones (1994), Ellis peters said that because they have trouble adapting her stories for video, which she would attempt to simplify the stories.Although I have read the book and am sad that they did not make a video of this journey, I must say that Stephen Thorne's reading gives an added dimension to the story allowing you to race ahead or contemplate the past as he make the characters come alive with his unique voice for each.This of course is book 15 in the series and so many things have been said, does not need to be said again. So lets hear the confession of brother Haluin and sojourn trough 12th century England with him as he takes a journey of the soul.One Corpse Too Many: The Second Chronicle of Brother Cadfael"},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"\`Irish Traditional Cooking' by leading Irish cooking school owner, Darina Allen is the fourth Irish-centric book I have reviewed and the second which warrants attention as a sound source for genuine Irish recipes. The other worthy book on this subject is \`the Irish Heritage Cookbook' by Irish-American high school teacher and culinary writer, Margaret M. Johnson. Of the two, Allen's book is the more scholarly in that it endeavors to give a relatively complete and authoritative view of the cuisine of all Ireland. While Ms. Johnson's book is very good, it is a much more personal view of both Irish and \`Irish-American' cooking.One area covered by Ms. Allen which are not covered by Ms. Johnson is the native Irish pantry with items such as homemade sausage, homemade vinegar, homemade marmalade, and the like.It's interesting that the two books take very similar approaches to Irish cooking. Unlike the classic Italian cookbook, neither proceeds by course, but primarily by principle raw ingredient. And, unlike Ms. Allen's great \`ballymaloe cooking school cookbook', this book is totally Irish.Ms. Allen's chapter subjects are Broths & Soups, Eggs, Fish, Game, Poultry, Lamb, Beef, Pork, Offal, Potatoes, Vegetables, Food from the Wild, Desserts, Pancakes, Breads, Oatmeal & Other Grains, Cakes & Biscuits, and The Irish Pantry. In addition to all the recipes, and there are certainly a goodly number for the price, there is an excellent historical foreword by Irish culinary historian, Regina Sexton. There are also numerous heading sections on groups of recipes such as nettles, herrings, eels, and many others. There is also an excellent little Appendices on Irish cheeses and cheesemaking; The Potato and the Famine; and Cooking Pits of the Fianna (Bronze Age sites associated with Ireland's early pre-Christian heroes such as Finn McCool (Fionn Mac Cumhaill)). The number of Irish Farmhouse cheese sources, 48 in all, is truly impressive. Since I suspect almost all of these cheeses are not available at our local megamart, I wish she would have given commonly available French, Italian, or American cheese equivalents.Almost all of Ms. Allen's recipes seem relatively short in procedure and in number of ingredients. I am very fond of how Ms. Allen has put her ingredients list in the margin rather than above the procedure, and I am also happy that all units are in purely English units, rather than both English and Metric. This is not because I disapprove of Metric. In fact, I prefer it, but in a book for an English or American audience, it is simply easier to read if all units are in our most familiar units.One of my more interesting discoveries in this book is the almost total absence of yeast baking. In the chapter on breads, there are 23 recipes, of which only three (3) include yeast. All others are leavened with baking power or baking soda plus buttermilk or both. With the great popularity of beer in Ireland, it is odd that there is no more yeast breadmaking, especially with brewer's yeast. While I am very fond of Irish Soda Bread, I find it lacks something compared to a good yeast bread; however, if you are yeast impaired, 20 recipes for chemically leavened quickbreads is a great source for breadmaking.I am also struck by the large number of recipes using apples in both this book and in the previously mentioned book by Ms. Johnson. The dessert chapter alone gives us 12 our of 34 recipes with apples. Oddly, the Irish notion of an apple dumpling recipe is quite different from the Pennsylvania Dutch recipe of a single peeled and cored apple encased in pastry. The Irish \`dumpling' is much more like what we would call a \`crumble' or \`cobbler', as it is a layer of sweetened apples covered by a pastry layer. One may have to use a little local knowledge for the apple recipes as Ms. Allen recommends no apple varieties for most recipes and when she does, they appear to be varieties native to Ireland such as \`Bramley Seedling cooking apples'. I guess Macintosh apples should do fine here.This book is a real winner if you happen to love mashed potatoes. Among the champ, colcannon, and boxty recipes, there are at least 12 recipes for mashed potatoes, not counting the various recipes for making dishes from leftover mashed potatoes such as griddle potatoes and potato & caraway seed cakes.Overall, while Ms. Johnson's book has a great selection of recipes, Ms. Allen's selection is even broader, without being more difficult. If all you want is easy recipes, Johnson is excellent. But, if you want a great lyric evocation of the foods native to Ireland, Allen's book is superior."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"My husband and I spent six months in Ireland in late 1999-early 2000, and I wanted to learn how to make some of the dishes we were eating in restaurants.

In other words, Ms. Allen includes more recipes but the instructions in each recipe are not as thorough. Given a choice, I would choose one of Ms. Johnson's books over Ms. Allen's. Ms. Johnson's recipes are more appealing as well, and more accessible. I might eat a bowl of nettle soup if it were presented to me but I would not seek it out or look for nettles to make it. Ms. Allen's book contains many recipes for things like Nettle Soup that most people will never make.

Anyone who is interested in cooking REAL IRISH FOOD and not just the wildly incorrect 'Corned Beef & Cabbage' that is seen as the traditional fare here in the U.S.A. on St Patrick's day needs this book in their kitchen. By the way, I had never tasted the said corned beef and cabbage until I moved to the U.S. and have no desire to do so again!!! If you have an interest in your Irish heritage and want to do it properly, then get this book and you will have a true representation of what traditionally was cooked in an Irish kitchen."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"Well, it has the kinds of dishes I was looking for, but the measurements are a little difficult to decipher at times.

It was wonderful, so I decided to explore further. I purchased this book because so many reviewers identified it as authentic. I can't speak to that, as I've never yet been to Ireland, but I can say it is well-organized, full of anecdotes, well-written, and bewitchingly charming. This weekend I cooked from it for Saturday's dinner. We had beef and Guinness stew, champ (similar to mashed potatoes, but with green onions), fluffy lemon pudding, and Gaelic coffee. HEAVEN.A bit of warning: a small percentage of the recipes are similar to those in older cookbooks in that the ingredients are embedded in the explanation. Also, there are some ingredients listed that I think may be hard to get. Still, there are plenty of recipes we can easily make here in the US, and what I have made so far is so amazingly good that I know I will pull this book out again and again."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"My family is from Ireland, so I've grown up listening to the stories of how my great-grandparents lived before emigrating from County Clare to the US. I spent two weeks there several years ago, and absolutely fell in love with the amazing food (and relatives!). I've purchased/borrowed many cookbooks of Irish cooking, but by far this is my most used and beloved one.The recipes are easy to follow and almost completely in Imperial measurements, so don't be turned off by thinking you will have to do metric-to-imperial conversions. Each step is well explained, and the photographs accompanying the entries not only make you hungry, but give enough definition as to what the final dish should look like. The author is head of the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland, which after reading this cookbook, I now long to attend. She does use some ingredients that are either not easily available (nettles, wild game) or something that many of us would consider eating (blood pudding). This doesn't detract from the overall pleasure of selecting and crafting one of the many wonderful recipes in this book. Hard to find items often can be ordered over the internet, or with a little web surfing, a suitable replacement found. I've been successful in doing some of my own tweaking/substituting in recipes I've made a few times as well, too, so I like that her recipes are not 100% follow the directions or else failure will occur.This would make a great gift for the beginning cook to the adventurous foodie."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"This is a wonderful cookbook. It blends a bit of gourmet from the late 1990s reminiscent of California worldly gourmet cuisine with all of the traditional recipes from Ireland's heritage. Darina Allen went through great lengths to collect Irish recipes from some of the oldest living though out both the Republic of Ireland and Northern. She includes passages and history. She includes original Gaeilge/Gaelic/Irish transcripts with translation and beautiful pictures. Darina Allen is a co-creator of the internationally acclaimed Ballymaloe Cookery (Cooking) School in Ballymaloe Ireland. As a side note, I love their Ballymaloe Relish, it's a testament to her great cooking skills and what encouraged me to buy this book. Good products = credit to the author. Even if someone isn't a great cook this book has mostly simple recipes (but not to say not complex with layers of flavor) as well as wonderful history for a non-cook. I love the illustrations that merit classic style that will surely make this book stand out for years to come. Not to mention complete Irish authenticity. If you own only one Irish cookbook, as a really great cook who is very picky about cookbooks, I highly recommend this one. Even suffice to say if I could only keep three cookbooks, it would be this one, the Joy of Cooking, and a CIA textbook."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"This book is very well written an authoritative. Recipes are clear and accurate. My only gripe is that so many of these recipes might be off-putting for American cooks. Do you have easy access to perywinkles, puffins, wild game, nettles etc.? So many dishes are just not do-able. However the recipes that do work are worth the price of the book. Great venison pie, scallops and mushrooms in cream, a great version of roast chicken, fish in bay leaves, and Guiness stew are awesome. So I have no regrets in buying the book, just wish I could get some of the ingredients called for.The desserts are almost all based on candy fruit or fruitcake type things so if you hate candied fruit you won't like that section.Great recipe for Irish coffee!"},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"If you love Irish food, you will love this book. for those in America, sometimes you have to substitute items because they can't easily be purchased here, but most times, you can find something to take its place and the recipes are very comforting and filling."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"The recipes are easy to follow, and I love how she gives explanations about the history of the dishes, how they fit into the Irish culture, etc. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"My friend wanted an Irish cookbook, so I began looking around for the perfect gift. I looked at a few options, but quickly discovered that she, being single and on a college student's budget, wouldn't be able to use many of the recipies in most of the cookbooks.Then, I found this one. It still has the nice recipies (from Christmas Cake, a.k.a. fruit cake, to a million and one things to do with duck and game to which the typical northwesterner doesn't have daily access), which will be very handy if she ever has to cook duck.What I like about this, though, is it has the practical, traditional recipies. It has soda bread (multiple types), it has blood pudding, it has buttermilk pancakes, it has soups, it has a Christmas dinner, etc. Because it's Irish, you've got to expect the bacon...it has that, too, along with a few funny stories in each section."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"I have just returned from a two week Darina Allen (Ballymaloe) cooking school in Ireland and her cooking books are my bible.

I wanted to believe that Darina Allen was what everyone said, THE person to study for learning Irish cooking. Well let me tell you, that is patently false! If her cooking school is anything like her book here, I feel sorry for anyone that wastes their money to learn from her school. I do not know if she even glanced at the recipes in this book or not but they are appallingly INACCURATE and will lead to nothing but disaster! This is not an exaggeration. For instance, on page 202, her bread pudding recipe calls for 8 slices of bread and *5 eggs and 5 cups of milk and 2/3 of a cup of cream*. If you follow this recipe you will wind up with nothing but a super wet, jiggly, bread pudding souffle! The ratio of liquid should be about 2 cups of milk for 8 slices of bread. Not 5! This is not a small oversight, this is gross incompetence. The same can be said of many of her recipes in this book. Like her orange cake. None of them turn out because the ingredients are atrociously inaccurate. If I sound angry, I am. I expect more from a \\"world renowned\\" expert chef of Irish cuisine. This book has pretty pictures that were made NOT using the recipes in this book. I find it just mind blowing that a woman of her reputation could let a cookbook be published with her name attached to it and not even ONCE looking at the recipes for accuracy before printing. I am blown away by how horribly inaccurate the measurements on these recipes are. This book is a waste of money. Unless you are neurotic and want to spend time taking her recipes and using trial and error on each one to get the actual right measurements on the ingredients I would avoid this book like the plague. I am shocked people pay her thousands of dollars to learn to cook. This book should be out of print. I will look to other Irish authors from now on for guidance in learning real, traditional, Irish food and I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"The Woolman family: Descendants of John Woolman and Elizabeth Borton, married 1684, who lived near Rancocas, Burlington County, New Jersey, included ... through his daughter, Mary Woolman Comfort","review":"Since I can't afford to go there and learn from her directly.

Gives a general idea on the dieties, histories, faith and belief. Finally she spends at least half a page talking about honoring the deities. Ending with Two rituals.The next chapter goes into going about starting entering into the religion. She talks briefly about the basic tools. She then gives a ritual in how to concentrate them for magickal workings and concentrating your sacred space; slong with altar arrangment. The Final thing she talks about is casting a sacred circle, which should probably have gone after sacred space.The third chapter is about the Magickal Calendar and the holidays in the faith. She talks about the greater sabbats briefly and the lesser sabbats even more briefly. The next thing she goes into is the moon and its cycles. Finally she goes more in detail on the four Greater Sabbats and then goes into Lunar Esabats.In the next chapter she talks about Spiritual Development. She gives a ritual of three ways of advancement it only takes up one page. She also gives breathing techniques. She dedicates a page to correspondences and then gives another page as a table for it. She also talks about charms. She ends the chapter with telling you how to be of service to others and gives a ritual as well.In the fifth chapter she talks about the Natural World and how to interact within it and use it. Then she goes into a ritual of exploring each of the four elements separately. When this is done she talks about the spirits of nature and how they are connected to the elements. After this is said and done she gives a ritual on communing with the spirits and the natural world. The final thing she talks about is the seasons and ends the chapter giving ritual and altar ideas for all four of them.In her next chapter she goes into Divination. She spends at least one and probably a little less then half a page dealing with spell casting. She spends a page going into runes and gives a table on how to translate runes. She talks about the witch's ladder, which is the first time I have heard about it. The next thing she goes into is Candle Magick and she gives a table that takes up about half the page on how to use candles in magick. She then gets into the darker stuff but not by much and just tells us how to do a banishing and then gives us a banishing ritual.The next to last chapter goes into journey you take within yourself. She talks about familiars and how to find one spiritually and physically. She spends time talking about Astral Travel about a page and not even a third of another one. She spends at least two pages talking about how to create your own spiritual journeys.The final chapter is for rites and rituals for stages of your life. She gives a ritual for Magickal Naming, Child Blessing, Handfasting, Significants Occasions such as a coming of age, Croning, and finally Death Rites.All in all I would say this is an okay book. Morningstar does not go into any warnings for dealing with love spells however. While the pictures are helpful they seem to take up more room then words and they seem to just be cushioning the book. This book would probably be more useful for someone looking for rituals more so then anything else.For a better essay/critic go herehttp://www.geocities.com/xnightshade17/TWWLIt.html"},{"Title":"The Wiccan Way","review":"I have been interested in Wicca since 1988 and a practitioner since 1993. Throughout my learning process I have bought and read many books on the subject. &quot;The Wiccan Way&quot; has a lot of good qualities. For a first time reader on the subject of Wicca it gives an easy to understand yet thorough presentation of the subject matter. For someone like myself with a background in Wicca it outlines the important aspects of the belief. I found it to be a great refresher guide for the basics. I had not bought a book about Wicca for a long time. I find a lot of the current material to contain too much useless information. Fairy magic, angel magic and other subjects of the like are more suited for readers who enjoy fiction rather than fact. &quot;The Wiccan Way&quot; presents a good understanding of Wicca without the theatrics. It is outlined well and organizes it's chapters in a manner that makes reading enjoyable and easy. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to explore the basic beliefs and practices of Wicca.

Mandy doesn't want to go, not only for the risk of Damien seeing her in a swimsuit, but because she has been having highly erotic dreams about him. Soon the two of them are playing games, both innocent resort games and more erotic private games. Eventually Damien finds out about Mandy's pregnancy; when he fully understands the reasons behind her secrecy, he cannot believe that the father could abandon her the way he did. Despite the intense sexual attraction between her and Damien, Mandy is worried about what the future will hold for her and her baby. Erin McCarthy has yet again given readers a beautifully written story, with humor, sensuality, a very real look at pregnancy and the trepidation when that pregnancy is unexpected. This book is an emotionally charged example of the best of Erin McCarthy."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Erin McCarthy has penned another heart warming, funny and all out sexy story in The Pregnancy Test.Mandy Keeling is in a major jam.

Mandy Keeling knew it was time to grow up and start living off of her parents' money. Lo and behold, nature was also trying to tell her something in the form of a pregnancy. She realized that she had to find a job that would allow her to support her baby since she wasn't getting any help from the baby's father. With the help of her friend Caroline, she lands a job interview with Damian Sharpton, an ogre of a boss whose already gone through four assistants in the last year. Amidst a bit of drama involving a rather embarrassing encounter, Mandy lands the job without letting him know she's pregnant. She manages to be a fabulous assistant while at the same time avoiding Damien like the plague.This intrigues Damien, who can't believe in the two months since he's hired her he's seen her only a few times. Yet she manages to know him in a way he never expected, anticipating his needs and acting on them. When he tries to exert his authority to regain control, it only ends up making him seem like an immature child, which ruefully amuses him. So much so that he impulsively decides to bring her along on a trip to the Carribbean with the reasoning that it's business. Mandy is reluctant to go, but he makes it mandatory so she can't refuse.Despite never seeing his secretary, he is attracted to her, albeit reluctantly so. He begins to question his sanity at bringing her along, but learns to relax and even show his sense of humor. As Mandy and Damien get to know each other, their already strong mutual attraction deepens, making it difficult to keep away from each other. When an intimate moment presents itself, so does the opportunity to confess to Damien about her pregnancy. When they finally kiss, it is as explosive as they imagined it would be, and things only get hotter from there. Mandy's pregnant body fascinates Damien, who reads up on the topic and becomes the world's expert on pregnant women, with amusing results. As their relationship grows, it becomes obviously how truly right they are for each other, and that they are already a family.Wow! This book is fabulous. Mandy and Damien are refreshingly honest and their physical intimacy is sexy and intense, the result of strong feelings for each other. Mandy may seem to be young and irresponsible, but nothing means more to her than the well-being of her child, which she will do everything in her power to protect, and Damien is not the hard-nosed enployer he's made out to be. Behind all those demands lays the heart of a vulnerable man who was hurt very badly but still has the capacity to love deeply. He is a true tortured hero who longs for happiness. The icing on the cake is Erin's unique brand of humor, which is truly laugh-out-loud funny. I adored this story, and love how McCarthy's writing keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"At first glance, this book appears to be a run-of-the-mill light romantic romp. Don't let the funny blurbs on the book cover fool you - this is so much, much more. My test of a book is if I become emotionally involved and feel that little \\"tingle\\" as I'm reading it. I can honestly say that this book surprised me by its tenderness, poignancy and true heart.In \\"The Pregnancy Test,\\" Erin McCarthy again presents an unusual premise for a romance - an abandoned pregnant woman and the man who falls deeply in love with her. How would she accomplish the love story in a believable fashion? Very skillfully, indeed.Mandy and Damien begin an affair with what seems to be insurmountable obstacles - she works for him and is already pregnant with another man's baby - and he is a sad and tortured man who feels he will never recover from loss of his wife.The story's warmth and compassion are evident in the beautiful dialogue as Damien slowly lets Mandy into his heart. While there are many funny moments, this book is deeply sensitive and the emotions are masterfully written. The scene where he declares his love is one of the best I've read.Yes, this is a very sexy book and if that bothers you, don't read it. But if you are looking for a genuinely moving story with heartwrenching passion, do not miss this one."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"British ex-pat Mandy is suddenly single, pregnant, and jobless in the Big Apple. A friend gets her an interview at a software company that will provide health benefits - the only problem is the boss is a hot head who can't keep a secretary. While experiencing the most hellacious case of morning sickness on an elevator, she manages to alienate the man riding with her, Damien \\"Demon\\" Sharpton, telling him that she is sick as a dog and has to suffer through an interview with an ogre of a man. When she realizes he is her prospective employer, rather than slink away, she faces the music, and liking her spunk, he hires her.\\"Demon\\" is attracted, while she hides her pregnancy and fends off erotic dreams about him. A trip abroad has them giving in to their feelings. Eventually she reveals her pregnancy and Damien gets involved andimmediately goes overboard in his concern for her pregnancy, often with humorous results.Author McCarthy uses her usual witty dialogue and sensuous situations to move the story along quickly (I read it in a day). There are a couple of hysterical scenes - particularly Damien taking over during an ultrasound, freaking out both Mandy and the technician. The book ended abruptly, almost seeming incomplete (only 248 pages with loose ends). I would have liked to know how his tattoo was altered too."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Another winner by Erin McCarthy.Mandy is pregnant and in desperate need of a job. Her friends get her a job interview with Damien Sharpton, as his Asst. He is known as Mr. Gorgeous but anti-social. Unbeknownst to Mandy, she is in the elevator with Mr. Gorgeous and gets a violent attack of morning sickness.She nearly dies when she realizes that Damien is the man looking for an Assistant. She doesnt tell him she is pregnant and tells him she has the flu after throwing up in his wastebasket between his legs, as she really needs the job and medical insurance. She gets the job and he immediately tells her he needs her to accompany him on a business trip to the Caribbean. She is worried about hiding her pregnancy from him. She plans to avoid him at all costs, dealing with him via email as much as possible.He finds out she is pregnant; there is an attraction between them that they act on. Damien is hysterical reading up on pregnancy and accompanies Mandy to her ob appointment. The words that come out of his mouth are unbelievable and Mandy nearly faints when he asks the ob/gyn a question about oral sex and pregnant women.I love all of Erin's books, and this is right up there as one of my all time favorites.P.S. - I have written a few other reviews on amazon under Pat Lieberman. I couldnt remember my password, so signed up under Patricia."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Erin's story is ultra light, too light if you ask me.Girl gets knocked up by awful boyfriend - meets gorgeous looking and \\"widowed\\" boss - they hit it off wonderfully and he proposes after many hot steamy nights of sex (don't forget morning sex and nooners).This is the kind of book that doesn't surprise and doesn't entice insight. It's flat, simple, uncomplicated, and might make some women entertain the idea of taking off to the Caribbean with their boss if the chance comes up.Sexual and young."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I expected this to be more focused on the the main character's pregnancy - you know, your typical chick lit pregnancy book. I was surprised to find the book read more like a steamy (emphasis on steamy) romance with pregnancy as one of the background stories. McCarthy can write a good sex scene for sure, but while I enjoyed the build up and the suspense, some of it rang false for me. I wanted more plot and more secondary characters. I think what was missing for me was the chick part. There wasn't a lot of interaction with her friends and there certainly wasn't enough shopping! I still recommend it though and think it's a good entry into the pregnancy/chick lit field. This is a good book to enjoy with a hot bath and your bunny slippers when you need a hot love story to warm you up. McCarthy is skilled at writing a good romance."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"If you are looking for a something hot, sexy, hilarious and sweet this one takes the cake! Its rare that a book can actually make you laugh out loud but this one certainly will bring you to tears laughing and then turn around and sit you in the middle of a sexy romatic seen so hot you'll have to take a smoke break afterwards! This is the first Erin Mccarthy book i've read and she'll for sure be on the top of my next purchase list! Excellent read, read it in 2 days, very hard to put down.The chemistry between the 2 leads is amazing, and there is no falling in, falling out of love.. once they click, they just keep clicking. very sweet story!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This is the first book I've read by Erin McCarthy and I am now one of her biggest fans! In the last six weeks, I've read five of her books and I've loved each one but this book is my absolute favorite. In a lot of books, it's always the hero who is British - it was a delight to find that here, it's the heroine who's English! And it's a fun and fast read - girl finds herself pregnant, baby daddy turns out to be a complete heel, she goes for an interview with a man who's said to have assistants for lunch and despite upchucking in his wastebasket during the interview, she gets the job! It's even more fun to read how she makes a herculean - and awfully successful - effort to stay out of sight of her boss lest he find out that she's been in the family way since the day they met. (As a long-time administrative assistant myself, I know that's next to impossible to do unless your boss travels all the time!) Unfortunately, the boss, Damien, finds our girl, Mandy, to be quite intriguing - maybe because he doesn't see her very often - and he decides to take her along on a trip to a Caribbean island. Mandy freaks - how is she going to hide her rapidly expanding tummy from this man who doesn't miss anything? She needs to keep her job, especially because of the insurance. (One has to suspend belief here because we all know how insurance companies are and if you've got anything that smacks of a pre-existing condition, you can forget being covered for it!)Well, we can all guess what happens, but what makes this story even more riveting (besides being laugh out loud funny - Mandy is a riot) is the leading man, Damien. He has got some serious demons that he has trouble getting past even though he knows deep down that Mandy is perfect for him. I absolutely fell in love with Damien. Not only did he not flip out once he found out Mandy was pregnant, but that seemed to draw him to her even more. I loved the way he got so totally involved with her pregnancy. Usually it's the heroine of the story who needs to convince herself that the hero is the man for her, but in this story, Mandy realizes that Damien is exactly what she and her baby need, but he is the one who is conflicted and feels that he can't do justice to a relationship with her. Watching him work through his issues until he realizes that his life is with Mandy is something I won't soon forget and is what made this book so special to me. You don't often see a wonderful yet flawed hero in these type of chick lit books. Damien is a great character!The love scenes in this book are also super hot and, at times, a bit graphic in that Erin McCarthy tends to use rather earthy language in these scenes. Weirds me out a little when I'm reading her books on the train and someone reads over my shoulder. I wouldn't necessarily use some of these words in mixed company, you know? Otherwise, I don't think there is a thing wrong with this book and it was a wonderful introduction to a great author. I still have a few more of her books to read and I can't wait till she comes out with something new. If you need an intro to Erin McCarthy, I would definitely recommend \\"The Pregnancy Test\\"!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"3.5 out of 5 stars. A sweet, hot, and funny story where you root for the two main characters from the beginning!! Mandy is a great character .... her plot about being pregnant (and everything that goes along with that) is really well written and thought out. Where Damien's past is revealed in a way where you want good things for him and it makes you wish you could help him out too. The chemistry between these two just sparks off of the pages!The only reason this novel didn't get a better/higher rating was because of how Mandy's roommates try to get involved and meddle things up .... it was very annoying and unnecessary for the plot.Reviewed By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This was actually the first book I read by Erin McCarthy and I have now gone on to read almost all of her novels. If that doesn't say it all I'm not sure what would.The Pregnancy Test was a funny, sexy, and entertaining read. I loved how the two characters met as well as the intrigue built around her trying to hide her pregnancy from the boss. It was a refreshing take on the usual romance formula and while some elements weren't my favorite as the two dealt with their issues and interfering friends, overall this book left a mark on me and turned me on to a new author. McCarthy is a talented writer and while this is definitely more of romantic fluff than substance, it still delivers. I would definitely recommend anything by McCarthy."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This was a fun, quick light read that I enjoyed. There aren't any drawn out relationship dramas, the characters are likable and it's good dialogue. The premise might be unrealistic in real life but who cares.I recommend for a weekend or vacation read."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Mandy Keeling never believed she would find herself in the position of being unemployed, and even worse, pregnant with no one to rely on. She didn't even try to lie to herself about being in love with Ben. When she broke the news of her pregnancy, he had wanted no part of it, and offered her money to make it go away. If he couldn't love her baby, it was over for them. Mandy knew she had to find a way to make a life for herself and the baby, and that meant she had to find a stable job. Her roommate Caroline suggested her employer was looking for a new assistant, but warned her that he was an absolute demon to work for. Mandy didn't care as long as it was a steady job with health insurance.Damien Sharpton couldn't believe he had hired a new assistant that had thrown up in his garbage can during their interview, but he was desperate. He was really surprised that she was turning out to be the best assistant he had ever had. He rarely saw her, and thought she might actually be avoiding being in the same room as he was. Mandy literally ran when she sensed Damien approaching her desk. She had been having very erotic fantasies about her drop dead gorgeous boss, and was afraid he would pick up on it as well as her pregnancy if they were in close proximity. After Damien decided he had enough of her physical absence, he told his beautiful assistant she was to accompany him on a working vacation to the Caribbean. When they arrived in the beautiful locale, it didn't take long for lust to overcome both of them. They both admitted their attraction and agreement that anything that happened between them would end when they got home. Damien was surprised and intrigued when Mandy admitted she was going to have a baby. He suddenly found himself wanting things he knew he had no right to.This was a sweet traditional romance. It is a good weekend read, but not one I would add to my personal library. What should have been an emotionally compelling story, the writing just missed the mark not drawing the reader in completely. Mandy and Damien thought they had met at absolutely the worst possible time. She was trying to get her life together, and be prepared for the baby she would be responsible for shortly. He was trying to forget his painful past unable to move beyond it. What they both failed to realize is that they were much better together than they could ever be apart."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This was a pretty lighthearted, cheerful little romp. There was no enemy, not much angst...not really ANY angst. It was a pretty mindless read, so it's good when you're in the mood for a nice little story that's not too involved and doesn't involve utilizing any part of your brain except the reading part. The best part of the book was that the heroine is British and that Ms. McCarthy makes every effort to utilize the British pronunciations when Mandy is speaking."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Another wonderful book about the obstacles life throws at you, and how you choose to react. I love it!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Excellent!!!! Everything about this book was perfect, right down to the happy ending. In this case, don't judge the book by it's cover....Kudos to Erin McCarthy (as always!)"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This is a light romance with a little humour thrown in. Sex talk\\\\scenes quite detailed in nature, with a little bit of swearing if this offends. Similar writer to Lori Foster, but a bit more humour.Mandy is pregnant, without a partner (after the converstion featuring the word pregnant) and owns a non-profitable toy shop. After previously relying heavily on her parents for financial support, she decides the situation has to change. She needs to become a mature responsible self-reliant adult. She needs a job with health insurance.Damien is the person who hires Mandy as his assistant.I won't go into any further plot details, as I don't want to spoil the read, but some things I liked which you may think relevant if considering a purchase.1. The lead male is not a macho man, infact he is definitely the more vulnerable of the two leads - with justifiable reasons.2. The two characters like each other from quite early on in the book, despite his reputation as an unreasonably demanding and intimidating person to work for. This is far more realistic than the usual hate/hate/hate/think you're sexy/love you scenario.3. The chemistry between the two characters develops well.4. They are both sweeties.An enjoyable light read"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This book was great. There was humor, great loves scenes and an interesting plot that got me hooked. Falling in love with your boss is hard enough, but also being pregnant by another man has to be the worst. Damian is a broody man with a tragic past that has hardened his heart and only a lovely Brit who is his assistant can help heal the pain and melt his heart. This is the first book I read by Erin McCarthy, but definitely not the last. I grab several of her other books and cannot wait to get reading!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"It's a pretty good read.A little bit erotic. Some parts I'll admist made me blush lol but they were very well writtin.Great for a summer read."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"The subtitle for this book should have been: How to Ruin a Perfect Premiss for a book.When I read the synopsis for this book I thought 'Wow! A pregnant girl loses her bf but her boss falls in love with her! What could go wrong?'Everything.I skipped pages, forced myself to read it (which is very rare) and with a feeling of defeat, I confess: I put the book down and never finished it (and never will).The storyline is corny, brainless and insulting. The main character, Mandy is a complete loser who doesn't inspire any compassion.Don't even get me started on Damien, her love interest! If he was a real guy, he would be the type of nutcase who stands outside your apartment, in the rain, rocking back and forth, grinning at you while singing a scary little tune.Wanna read chick-lit? Get another book."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I really thought I was going to like this book as I am easy to please when it comes to chic lit novels. This was pretty bad and it had like 4 or 5 sex scenes that literally went on for a whole chapter for each of them. Its like the author couldn't think of a plot or good dialogue and just decided to fill the pages with rauchy sex scenes. I like romance and all but this was overkill - I found myself skipping pages by the third one. It was weak, totally unrealistic and predictable."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Mandy Keeling enjoys the life of a yuppie in New York City until a series of nauseous morning wake-ups leads to a pregnancy test that comes up pink. Not ready to claim an offspring, her boyfriend flees Manhattan. Trying to stay with her routines as much as possible, Mandy arrives at NY Computing for a job interview though her stomach still shakes from morning sickness. However, her efforts fail in the elevator where occupant Damien \\"Demon\\" Sharpton comes to her aid. Not long afterward to her lasting humiliation, Damien interviews Mandy as she borrows his trashcan. He hires her.Her plan is to hide her growing waistline from her boss as long as possible using text editor and email to avoids contact with Damien as much possible. Mandy proves to be an effective employer though she is sick a lot. Damien asks Mandy to travel with him on an assignment, which she reluctantly agrees to do, but she wonders how to hide her pregnancy and cool off her sexual desires for her boss.PREGNANCY TEST is an inane yet humorous contemporary office romance that stars a hunk whose workforce assumes he was named for the star of the Omen movies and a nice young lady who is half in love with him, but fears his reaction to her pregnancy. Though her Lucile Ball antics make Mandy look zany she holds the tale together (better than her waistline). Readers will believe her actions to hide the truth (health insurance makes for strange behavior) as long as possible once she meets brusque business brain Damien, who is also falling for his Mandy though she seems to elude him. Erin McCarthy provides an enjoyable lighthearted tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This was a cute heartwarming story. Easy to read... Perfect for some down time.

Her books have laugh out loud humor, sexy love scene(very tastefully done) and a good story. In The Pregnancy Test, Mandy Keelings find herself pregnant and in need of a 9 to 5 job. The father is MIA and well, a jerk. Her friend/roommate helps her get an interview with a man with a reputation of making his assistants cry.Damien Sharpton is an executive at NY Computing and is in need of a new assistant....AGAIN. He is a very serious, scary man, with a past he does not want talk or even think about but when he is on his way to his office, he is face to face with a woman who is about to throw up. He isnt a total ass everyone thinks he is, he cant just leave her, and finds out she is his 8 o'clock interview...great.

Definitely read this!!!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Could not put it down, great pacing. Heroine is a laugh a minute. She is also struggling with many issues in her life. Hero is a tortured soul, but unlike in some books, this guy really had a reason. The prgnancy was really a test for the father, for love. Beautiful love scene when he comes to her in the middle of the night. I thouroughly enjoyed this book, had read it a few years back, and re-read it again when I ran out of good books to read. Only wish there had been an epilogue where hero holds the baby. 'Nough said.

The characters deal with some personal issues that just help to enrich the story. I loved how McCarthy included real issues that people have to deal with. There are a lot of things to consider while being pregnant and she covered some of them in a humorous way. The only thing about the book I hated was the prologue! I almost didn't read the book because of it (other peoples high marked reviews are the only reason I kept reading). In fact I recommend skipping it. Just start with chapter one you don't miss much by not reading the prolog and there are only a few places in the book that reference back to it."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Mandy Keeling is pregnant. Pregnant, boyfriendless, and in need of a job. Enter Damien \\"Demon\\" Sharpton, the brusque, driven man who can give her that job. The strikingly handsome man who inspires R rated dreams. The wounded, closed-off man who Mandy is beginning to suspect harbors a gentle heart, a sense of humor, and a scarred past...I really enjoyed this love story from McCarthy, one of my favorite contemporary authors. It's a book that grew on me - I've just recently re-read it and got more out of it the second time around.Mandy is a likable character, someone you'd like to be friends with. And Damien is a man who starts off closed and mysterious but opens more and more, much to the satisfaction and delight of the reader. He's injured, that's for sure, but he's a good man with a good heart. A very yummy hero :)Supporting characters were decent, but Mandy's \\"New York Girlfriends\\" could have been stronger. They just didn't have a super genuine feel to them, like all of McCarthy's attention was given to Damien and Mandy, and none was left for the friends.All in all, watching these two fumble around, come together wonderfully, stumble through their problems and eventually end up where they should be is a fun ride full of anticipation, humor, and lots of hot hot hot sex. I'm looking forward to reading the rest in the series!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I am a huge fan of Erin Mcarthy. I have read many of Erins books and none of them have disapointed me.

Damien is a scared soul that have shut himself from the world, what he didnt know when he hired Mandy to be his assistant is that with her aproach to life she stirred something in him that he believed to be dead.

Why, oh why, did there have to be an \\"except\\":)For me, there was a very strong \\"ick\\" factor in this book.

She goes to work for the hero in his office as his assistant. They hit it off....go on vacation....and one thing leads to another.If you as a reader have no issues with a woman sleeping with a man while being pregnant with another man's baby...THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. It is extremely well written, funny, and very touching at times. The last paragraph of this book made me gasp out loud, and may be one of my favorite \\"surprises\\" that I've ever received while reading a romance novel.

Both characters are likeable. I enjoyed Mandy's competence and efficiency at work. I loved Damien's involvement with the pregnancy. He read more pregnancy books than she did. When she was getting an ultrasound, she asked the technician a question, but Damien gave the technical answer. A minor occurrence happens at the very end which totally surprised and delighted me. Lovely ending.Story brief: Damien is wounded from his past. He was married to Jessica who was murdered. He was a suspect but later cleared. He has avoided relationships with anyone for three years. Mandy is British, living in New York. She accidentally gets pregnant from Ben. He wants nothing to do with it.

Erin just does it better than the others. Funny but not silly."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"While overtly graphic, this book is wonderful! This is the frist book I have read by Erin McCarthy but I'm hooked now! Short version: Mandy finds herself in a pick (jobless, dumped & pregnant) but her friends help her find a job, where she found love. While this would RARELY happen in real life, this makes this book all the better to get lost in. I'm sure you'll agree...."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I found myself cracking up so many times throughout this book. At the same time the book was sexy and pulled at your heartstrings. My only complaint is that I want to know more about what happens with Mandy & Damien. I felt the ending was a tad rushed, but I still loved the book. I actually read this through the library but I am planning on purchasing this book for my personal collection - I can definitely see myself wanting to read it again. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"The plot was fun, but I didn't like the characters. Mostly the hero in the book. I just thought he was a little bit of a sissy so I couldn't really get into the book. It wasn't one of Erin's better books. At least to me. The plot was fun. The guy wasn't."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"wonderful book. As soon as I finished reading it I wanted to read it again. It is definitly going on my keep shelf. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a story you can't put down, then when your done you wish it never ended."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Since I read You Don't Know Jack first, I had to give this book only 4 stars just because, I liked the former better in comparison. Having said that, this book is also a fun and wonderful read. The story was cute, the charcters were fun and so were the secondary charcters. My only complaint was that it wasn't hot like it could have been. Erin McCarthy's men are tender and charming but they are not the alpha males that Lori Foster pens. Other than that, it's a book worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I started this book really into it, thinking it would be a great read. And it was, up until the Caribbean trip. The sex scenes were so overly graphic, you'd think a teenage boy had written them. And the characters just got dumb after that. It was really hard for me to finish, and I agree with some of the other reviewers who saw the ending from a mile away. Initially I was going to try some of the author's other books, but this one was unnecessarily raunchy in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I didn't know enough about any of these people to care if they lived happily ever after or not, but I'm sure they will, despite all the poorly resolved problems they have, because after all, the sex was amazing. A much better read with the same basic plot line is Morning Glory by LaVyrle Spencer."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Although the storyline is cute, the characters likeable, and the romance sweet, I felt that far too much of this short read was dedicated to steamy sex scenes. Now, if you're looking for hot sexual descriptions, you'll love this book (because boy, is it sexy), but if you're expecting more standard fare chick-lit, you might find yourself raising your eyebrow at the graphic descriptions. I felt that the focus on sex overwhelmed what was otherwise a compelling story. Although I like author's writng style, and found it quite humorous and touching, I don't think I'll be reading any more of her books b/c they're a little too soft-porn Harlequinesque for me."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This book was horrible. Jus plain porn with no plotline nor argument at all. It has gone straight to the dustbin, and I could not wait to finish it to do just that (I tend to give the books a chance up to the last page in case they improve and have something to tell, this was not the case). This is not a love story or a comedy, it feels fake, and the characters have no depth. Don't buy it."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Erin McCarthy's writing is awesome. She is extremely romantic but hey, everyone needs that sometimes! If you like detailed sex scenes, then you won't go wrong with this book. :D Very easy read and also an extremely cute book."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This was my first Erin McCarthy book and I found it to be very entertaining. The book is about Mandy who has just found out she is pregnant and the guy she was seeing leaves her because he doesn't want to raise a child. She has to sell her business and get another job in order to gain health insurance and income. She gets a job working for Damien who is a very gruff businessman who has made his past assistants cry; however, Mandy changes Damien's demeanor for the better.The book is very straight and to the point. There aren't a lot of twists or other plot points going on. It focuses souly on Mandy and Damien's relationship and the things they are struggling with. I loved the fact that the story wasn't clouded with other plots or a ton of twists. It was a love story that you can just escape into. The only negative thing I will say; and it may or may not be a negative to some, it was very graphic in regards to intimate scenes between the two. At one point I thought I was reading a story from Penthouse or something. Other than that, this was a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Things have been really hard for Mandy Keeling. She loses her boyfriend then finds out that she is going to have a baby. Time for Mandy to grow up, so she takes a job with Damien Sharpton a man who is known to make his assistants cry. A trip to the cribbean makes Mandy see Damein in a whole new light. But there are ghost that must be put to rest before Mandy and Damien can be together.\\"The Pregnancy Test\\" was the first book by Erin McCarthy that I have read and I must confess that I got because of its cover. This was a fun,sexy read and I can't wait to read more from Ms. McCarthy."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This was an enjoyable book to read, as usual with McCarthy. Her characters are interesting and fun. There are plenty of steamy scenes as well. I enjoyed the story.Definetly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I just found out I am pregnant, so I thought the topic of this book came along at a good time. Mandy has just found out she's pregnant, broken up with her boyfriend (the father) and sold her business. She wants to find a stable job with health insurance and take the best care of her baby that she can. She does land the job...but just barely! After puking her way through the interview Damien \\"Demon\\" Sharpton he decides to hire her. Now, she just has to avoid him until she's ready to tell him that she's pregnant.This story is really cute and fun to read. It is semi-predictable, but in a good way. The love scenes in here are hot and steamy! It is a great summer."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I'm about half-way done with this book and I can't say I am excited to finish it.It started off great, I was interested in what was going on. It was funny and quirky.But after Mandie and Damien take off for Punta Cana, their vacation becomes a never-ending lovefest. If I wanted to read something so raunchy, I'd pick up a dirty novel. But the worse part is, the sex DOES NOT END. What started as hot-n-heavy has become redundant and completely over-the-top. We get it - they're great in bed!!!I bet I can predict what will happen: both are saying that the relationship \\"cannot go any further than sex.\\" They get back home and their secret affair continues. They cannot stop thinking about eachother. She has the baby, he proposes and wants to be the baby's father and they live happily ever after. L-A-M-E."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Goodreads Description- Ordinarily, I'm a fan of pink-lovely colour, does smashing things for the complexion. But not when it's the bright, glaring stripe staring back at me on the pregnancy test. Then, pink is the colour of major oops, of morning sickness, of boyfriends who seemed decent but now are part of some Jerk Witness Protection Program.Still, I've got a few things going for me-bitter humour, a divine right to eat till I'm the size of Marlon Brando, and good friends who've managed to get me a job interview with one Damien Sharpton: in need of a personal assistant, and some say, a good, swift kick in the arse. If you want to make a lasting impression, by all means, toss your cookies in your future boss's wastebasket, which is located directly between his excruciatingly sexy legs.Apparently, Mr. Gorgeous-But-Unbearably-Anti-Social must like personal assistants who violate his trash can, because I got the job. And if I can avoid him via text messaging for the next seven months of health insurance, everything will be just fine. Except that he's just asked-no, insisted-that I go with him on a business trip to the Caribbean. Gulp. Ordinarily, this would be cause for celebration. Ordinarily, I'd shave my legs, pack my bikini, revel in day-glo drinks and my seething lust for Mr. Swarthy-And-Secretive. But there's nothing ordinary about this situation...which means it could be absolutely extraordinary...This is a book where I think it was extremely important to copy the book description into my review. The reason for this is because this is a book where the book is NOT what is as advertised. Not saying that is a bad thing in this case but the story was NOTHING like I expected it to be. I thought this would be a light chick lit read about a British girl in New York, classic chick lit by the way, who finds herself pregnant with the guy not wanting the baby and from there the sillyness begins. Well that is sort of what happens but what I didn't expect was all the graphic sex scenes. I mean this was Harlequin romance all the way under the disguise of a chick lit cover. And again that isn't a bad thing....unless that isn't what you are looking for in a book....and some people aren't. This book is a very quick read about Mandy and her boss Damien falling in love very quickly but during that process most of what you read is them having sex...and in very graphic terms. I wanted to make sure that I reviewed this book because it certainly wasn't what I expected and I haven't read this author before. I'm not a prude and the sex scenes don't bother me but if they bother other readers I wanted to post a review that those readers could learn that this isn't a Shopoholic type book at all. Close but sex sex sex. So as always....don't read a book by its cover or description apparently because I did not expect it to be so Harlequin like. If it weren't so cliched and had a better story line it would have had higher ratings for me, but I just couldn't because I am having buyers remorse and it just wasn't the type of book I thought I was buying. I liked the story but wanted better writing and less sex filler. 3 stars.Oh and now that I am adding this to Amazon I noticed that part of the books genre listing is travel, business travel!! What a joke!! This is not about business travel. Yes the main characters go on a business trip but they have sex the entire time. I tagged it as Erotica on Goodreads because it was so heavy with sex. Just an FYI for readers not looking for this. I just cannot believe how this book is advertised and described so wrong. It's like they are trying to hide the fact that this book has sex in it...not just sex...but pregnant sex which does kind of have an \\"ick\\" factor as another reviewer has said. I do hope this review helps someone in the decision to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Mandy is in a pickle. She's just closed down her toy store in NYC and is therefore, jobless. She's also just found out she's PG and the father wants nothing to do with her or her baby.On a whim, she goes to a job interview her friend sets up for her and meets Damian Sharpton who is instantly attracted to her. Even though Mandy is interested, trying to keep her \\"condition\\" a secret and have a romance at the same time might be a hard test to take.What can I say? This is fluff at its fluffiest. The premise was kind of lame, the characters shallow and unbelieveable, and it was just plain...stupid in all honesty.There was just no substance to this book at all. I finished it in less than 2 hours, and despite getting a reasonable amount of entertainment out of it, to me it seemed like half the book was made up of sex scenes and the plot line was, for lack of a better term, sidelined.All and all, it's a classic Erin McCarthy book. Fluffy, reasonably fun, lighthearted, and in no way, shape, or form intellectual."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I can usually depend on getting an excellent read when I purchase an Erin McCarthy book. I absolutely love Houston, I Have A Problem, Heiress For Hire, and A Date With The Other Side. I went in reading The Pregnancy Test with excitement and high hopes of another excellent read. The Pregnancy Test fell short of the mark for me. I feel that probably most of the reason why is that I just didn't care for the hero and heroine like I do with her other stories. It was hard for me to sympathize with the heroine. It wasn't a lie exactly, but she neglected to tell the hero, her boss, that she was pregnant. This really bothered me especially after he asks her to go to the Caribbean with him. Plus, the whole story of Damien's first wife and her murder was a little too much. Pretty much everything with this story is too much.The story begins with the hero, Mandy going for an interview for a job. She gets somewhat sick in the elevator, and embarrasses herself because she insults Damien, the one she is interviewing with, without realizing that she is talking to Damien. Anyways, she gets the job and Damien becomes interested in getting to know Mandy. He has pretty much alienated himself from everybody since his wife's murder. He asks Mandy to go to the Caribbean with him for work related purposes, but also because he wants to get to know her better. She intrigues him because she is constantly trying to avoid him. Go figure there because she doesn't want him to know she is pregnant. Her relationship with the baby's father didn't work out. They start to grow closer while on the trip, and when Mandy realizes where things are headed with Damien (in the bedroom), she tells him about her pregnancy. Plus, she wanted to share with him the baby's first movements.The second half of the story is about them going about home and trying to go back to the way things were between them with him being the boss and her the employee without any romantic entanglements. But now that they've been together, Damien is not so sure he can go back to being the loner that he once was. And Mandy doesn't know how she can continue to work for him when she has developed deeper feelings for him. There are some very cute and humorous moments especially in this book, like when Damien reads a pregnancy guide and gets to the section on having sex while pregnant. Too funny! The Pregnancy Guide is not my favorite Erin McCarthy book, but it was ok. 4 stars!"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"I bought this on a whim as my first Erin McCarthy book, and it will not be my last!

SHE IS AN EXCELLENT WRITER IN MY OPINION. \\"MOUTH TO MOUTH\\" WAS MY FAVE, BUT NOW I DEFINETELY THINK THAT \\"THE PREGNANCY TEST\\" IS BUMPING IT'S WAY UP TO FIRST PLACE ON MY LIST OF FAVORITE McCARTHY STORIES. IT WAS SUCH A STEAMY STORY BETWEEN DAMIEN AND MANDY. THEY REALLY, REALLY DIG EACH OTHER AND IT'S NICE TO SEE A MAN WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF PREGNANT WOMEN(WELL AT LEAST NOT TOO AFRAID). I LAUGHED A LOT TOO. I LOVED MANDY, SHE WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

Definitely worth spending money on..."},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"Erin McCarthy is an automatic buy for me! Her stories are always funny, sexy, but sensitve and her latest effort delivers on all three counts...and then some.Mandy Keeling has just experienced the mother of all changes! Her boyfriend has dumped her, her toy store is not where her \\"bliss\\" is and she has just found out that she's pregnant. Could it get any worse? Oh yeah, and than some! She is on her way to a job interview with Damian \\"Demon\\" Sharpeton when morning sickness strikes...well, almost. She has to keep the pregnacy quiet so she can be hired. The Demon won't hire a pregnant woman...so imagine her dismay when she realizes she's talked out of turn to none other than the Demon. Well, she can get that back during the interview...or she could have if she didn't have to yak in his trashcan right between his legs. So when Demon...I mean Damian hires her she's just more than a little shocked. When he demands that she travel with him on his vacation...well, not looking forward to that. She's gone out of her way to avoid her boss. Her tummy is starting to pooch and there's no easy way to hide that in a bikini. Well, the cat's about to be let out of the bag, along with the burning attraction they both feel for each other...so just why won't a relationship work between them again? After all they're a ready made family and they care about each other.Mandy and Damien are truly wonderful characters. Ms. McCarthy's trademark wit is plenty evident and nice addition to this very quirky but romantic story. For a fast-paced, emotional, entertaining read Ms. McCarthy is an author you should pick up! You truly won't be sorry!Official Reviewer for Romance Designs"},{"Title":"The Pregnancy Test","review":"This is the first book by McCarthy that I have picked up, it won't be the last. This is also the first modern romance/chick-lit work I have picked up in a very long time, and it wasn't so bad. There was nothing here too earthshattering, but there was some very funny writting. I thought the end wrapped up a bit too fast and easy, but sometimes real life is like that...things just fall into place.

It's a book about when, where and what to remodel. It's about permits and contractors. It's about what a remodel will gain you when you sell the house. It's about the real world, not the world you see on the remodelling shows on television.

Anyone with a hint of open-mindedness would have a joyous liberation from the mere thought of her findings to be reality. Even one that has accepted &quot;Higher sense perception&quot; to be reality would find the evidence to be worth reading. Clarivoyence, psychometry, telepathy, and auric fields are at the core of her studies. Being a true scientist, and reluctant believer herself, Mrs. Karagulla presents case after case with a frankness and sincerity that can't be ignored. She is wise and retains her scientific nature by not jumping to any harsh conclusions in a feeble attempt to explain the universe like many contemperary authors. It starts as a few individual cases, and moves into a suggested world that is known to most of us as science fiction. Two-thirds the way through one is likely to be overwhelmed with input and must remember that what they are reading is really real. The extensive history of the subject that is presented is surprisingly eye-opening and equally impressive. I've read much on the subject. Proof may be impossible for now, but going by quality comprehensive information, this book is at the top of it's class."},{"Title":"Breakthrough to Creativity: Your Higher Sense Perception","review":"Shafica Karagulla was a woman thoroughly educated at the best schools in the U.S. in science.

Ingo Swann, who pioneered Remote Viewing for the U.S. Army -considers this a helpful book and recommends it in his books on Power entitled \\"Power\\" Vol I and \\"Power\\" Vol II.

For instance, her study included having participants do a detailed medical evaluation using their 'sight' and then comparing it to the patients' medical records. Written in the late 80's, it is ahead of it's time.

A must have for NJ salt water fisherman."},{"Title":"Fishing the New Jersey Coast","review":"This is a MUST book for Surf fishermen in New Jersey. He makes it so easy to move up and down the coastline and know locations and local spots to get started. It is an indispensible reference book. Unlike so many fishing books that tell you to go to this lake or this town, he takes you there and helps you get started with specific spots and descriptions and seasonal timelines for different species. I've bought more than one to put in my car and surf bags. I never want travel the state surf fishing and exploring new spots without Jims expert book."},{"Title":"Fishing the New Jersey Coast","review":"I think Jim did a great job explaining tactics and habits but I would have like to have seen more detailed maps and charts on when the fish were running and where."},{"Title":"Fishing the New Jersey Coast","review":"The cover is upside down to the printing inside the book. The information inside is usefull. I think a better quality control should be established before sending the book to customers."},{"Title":"The Bhagavad Gita With the Uttara Gita","review":"This magnificent edition of the Gita was brought to life by a man who's own life was a living embodiment of that central archetype of the Song Celestial, the Stithaprajna, the self-governed sage. Raghavan Iyer's work is simultaneously complex and supremely detached. In a wholly fresh rendition of the timeless Hindu bible, each of the verses of the Gita are linked with a seminal thought drawn from every tradition of Humanity. This linkage serves to focus the mind upon the Gita's ancient meaning in radical new ways - bringing insight and clarity by casting the perennial philosophy in a wholly unexpected light. This rendition helps the true spiritual seeker do what Krishna himself helped Arjuna do - master the unruly torrent of life, by questions, by humility, by strong search, and by service, so that, in time, his inner light would arise spontaneously within, and guide him upon the Path. If I had only one book I could own, and live by, this would be the one."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I am a huge fan of Anne's Cake Mix Doctors. The books got me into baking (which I was scared to do) and her recipes not only make cake mix GOOD they WORK. (Anne's Banana Cake in the first book made satisfied my nostalgic longing for a similar Sara Lee cake we used to have for family dinners in the 1970s.) So I was happy to give The Dinner Doctor a try if just for the memories (we had a lot of tuna casserole for those family dinners) but this book is not about nostalgia: It is perfect for the modern family to make some quick, easy, tasty meals using things I easily found in the supermarket. I am stuck right now on the deli roasted chicken recipes (we call them rotiserie chickens in NYC). For my money, these chix are tasty, easy, cheap, and abundant but after awhile they are just... well... roasted chickens. Anne must have at least 20 ideas and recipes for taking these chickens and just doctoring them with some fresh ingredients to make something different and, yes, BETTER. I plan on making more but we have tried and loved the Asian chicken salad and also liked the burrito bake. The brownie drops were great and the simple mushroom galette was perfect for the fall. I've only had the book for a week and already I can tell that at the very least I'll have lots of great ideas for meals to come (and a few new cakes to boot!)."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I had intended to get this out of the library before deciding whether to buy it or not. But I happened upon it at a bookstore and, after perusing it for a few minutes, decided that I just HAD to have it. It is CRAMMED with terrific recipes, ideas and hints, and has become one of my all-time favorites! Almost everything is quick and easy to make, with very precise instructions. Most things are not horrifically fattening, or at least they can be made successfully with low-fat substitutions. Standouts that have become staples in our house include the Nacho Cheese Soup, Mac & Cheese, Corn/Potato Chowder, Dun-buttered muffins, Asian Chicken Salad, Sour cream-cinnamon loaf and John's Summertime Slaw. I would say 98% of the recipes I've tried have worked beautifully.One thing I like about this book is that there are not a lot of shameless repeats and recyclings, as there are in the cake books. In this book she gives you variations on the recipe in a small box or sidebar, rather than creating a \\"new\\" recipe simply by changing the name and one ingredient. And, like the other books, it's very well written in Anne's chatty and unpretentious style. Right on, Anne!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I'm not much of a cook, really. I'll heat things up, or maybe throw some meat or veggies on the grill, but other than that I'm fairly limited in the kitchen. Thus, my wife and I resort to eating out far too much - and that gets old fast.Enter Anne Byrn's Dinner Doctor book. The appeal was immediate and lasting. Quick receipes made from simple ingredients resulting in unbelievably tasty dishes. I fell immediately under the spell of this book and have since produced many of the recipes at home.Unlike so many cookbooks, the results of these recipes actually look and taste like they are supposed to, and the instructions are quick and to the point. What's more, Byrn includes numerous side notes explaining ways to doctor the recipes even further and she even encourages would-be chefs to experiment with her creations.I don't give five stars very often, but this is actually a cookbook that lives up to its promise. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"The premise of \`the Dinner Doctor' by Anne Byrn is that good meals can be made with less trouble than if they were made from scratch if prepared foods such as frozen ravioli or deli potato salad or canned baked beans are enhanced with extra ingredients such as diced vegetables or bottled salsa.It is important to recognize that contrary to two different statements on the cover of the book, the author's premise is not about speed. Byrn praises slow cooking as one technique to achieve \`doctored' meals with less trouble and includes an entire chapter on the subject. She also makes the point that she is not interested in holding a stopwatch to the reader to beat.One should be clear that Ms. Byrn is not entirely a throwback to the style of cooking praised in the fifties where virtually all meals were seen as something out of a box or a can. Healthy food with only a reasonable amount of unnecessary additives is her objective.The author to which she is the most similar is Sandra Lee of \`semi-homemade' fame. Both of these writers could be compared to Rachael Ray's style of cooking, but it is important to recognize the differences. While both Byrn and Lee are concerned with \`easy', Rachael is mostly concerned with quick. What is so amazing about Rachel's results is that they are achieved with so few prepared ingredients. I think Rachael succeeds so well at what she does because she relies on a certain level of kitchen skills which may be more than whan Ms. Byrn expects. Almost all of the commercial preparations Rachael uses are achieved from packaged skinless and filleted meats, cleaned and cut vegetables, and canned rather than dry beans. Ray achieves her results by modifying classic recipes to use smaller dices and grilling or stovetop braising in place of oven roasting or braising.The differences between Anne Byrn and Rachael Ray are exactly where I have reservations about Byrn's approach. At the outset, I disagree with her suggestion that one should stock a pantry with a wide variety of dried, bottled, canned, and frozen ingredients. As I have said with every other writer who makes this suggestion, the best approach is simply to get the ingredients for dishes you definitely plan to make in the next week, so in the case you don't like that dish, you don't have ingredients you may not need. I have it on the authority of no less than Madhur Jaffrey that this is a wise thing to do.I also have the vague suspicion that Ms. Byrn is too concerned about always creating dishes with a great complexity of flavor. I got this idea when I read her suggestion about enhancing deli potato salad with several supplementary ingredients to improve the \`bland' salad. Since I happen to like simple potato salads with no more dressing than a bit of oil and garlic and parsley, I was really wondering why she thought a simple potato salad needed any help in the first place. The irony of this is that she was so proud of the story she told about a meeting with Julia Child where Ms. Child created a salad simply by washing and drying some lettuce, salting the lettuce, and tossing the greens with some olive oil, and that was it.In spite of my reservations, this is a very worthy book for the right audience. Judjing from the number of five star ratings and review, this book has found that audience. It does the excellent service of giving estimates of how long each dish will take to prepare and cook. Also, these recipes are very easy to read and follow. If you are looking for tasty dishes with little trouble to prepare plus some general suggestions on getting in and out of the kitchen quickly, this book will work for you. Just be sure you are aware of the trade offs. This food will, in general, be more expensive, have more additives, and be slightly more fatty (note the high use of grated and processed cheese) than if you worked entirely from scratch. I give the book high marks for giving you a large number of recipes for a very reasonable cost."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"If you are the type of family who eats spaghetti, frozen pizza, tacos and a few meat-and-threes a week then this is a GREAT pick for your household. My friend got hooked on this book because she doesn't have air-conditioning (big environmentalist) and needed dinners that didn't always demand a hot oven. This book has many recipes that do not need to be cooked at all. I haven't made anything that my family has rejected, and a few are even really good \\"girl\\" food. The penne pasta with asparagus and walnuts is one that comes to mind. Another, with smoked salmon in a cream sauce (that took about FIVE minutes to make!) tastes fancier than anything I've ever made. I've tried lots of \\"quick\\" \\"easy\\" \\"basic ingredients\\" cookbooks but this one is the one I use almost every day. There are several recipes that will probably excite children more than parents for picky eaters. A little warning, though: this book doesn't cook from scratch, so it is difficult to keep recipe supplies on hand. You will find yourself having to go to the grocery store every few days to pick up a few things. I'm more of a \\"stuff-pantry-with-the-basics\\" person so this took a little getting used to. Also, if you are in any way interested in gourmet food and like cooking classes and all that, you might not like this book. But if you, like me, are a busy mom with a thousand things to do besides cook for two hours a day, this will work well for you. HIGHLY recommended. My girlfriends also love it."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I put off writing this review for a while, because I really love the Cake Doctor books, which are just fantastic, and didn't want to say anything that would hurt Ms. Byrn's feelings--she seems like a pretty cool chic. This book, however, was a major disappointment. I made several recipes from it and I'd say three out of four got two forks way, way down--my family did not like them at all. The other reviewer that says she depends a lot on soup and cheese, half and half is accurate. If I wanted such meals, I'd just zip on over to Cambells.com and save myself the cost of the book. I didn't find anything in here that my family was glad to see again aside from the Ham-and-Cheese Impossible Pie, which I found out was pretty well known elsewhere.This book also has some pretty odd recipes. It's sort of like she stuck to her own family's favorites that didn't translate well into other family's taste--their appeal is not nearly broad enough to justify their being included. Creole Shrimp with Polenta, Curried Chicken and Artichoke Casserole might be favorites in her home, but I assure you they aren't in mine. My family didn't even care for her Tuna Casserole.I would recommend buying a book from people who write about dinner--mainly \\"Fast. Cheap. Good.\\" by the Desperation Dinners writer, which also includes your grocery budget to boot (with chapters like \\"How To Eat On $100 a Week\\", how can you go wrong?). Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross cook meals that have a tried and true broad appeal, as they have a nationally syndicated column called Desperation Dinners. With all the feedback a national column generates, their substance is tried and true with a broad appeal to all.As a frugal mom with a limited budget and limited space for books, I regret this purchase and wish I could return it. Sorry, Anne. Stick to cakes."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I am also stunned as is a previous reviewer over all the great reviews of this book. It was given to me as a gift and I was so excited when I got it. I found a bunch of terrific sounding recipes and flagged them to try them out. Needless to say,almost every main dish recipe has turned out HORRIBLE not matter how good it sounded!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, not too healthy.The desserts are OK but really, we don't eat dessert for dinner. Anyhow, I thought this book was a bit deceiving...also, it's not THAT fast. A better book is Cooking Light's Superfast Suppers so I would suggest that for healthier and more tasty meals."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I liked the Cake Mix Doctor, but this book is phenominal. I typically try a few recipes from a new book, and find one or two that I like and will make on a regular basis. EVERYTHING I have tried from this has been fantastic.I highly recommend the Tuscan Chicken, Parmesan Chicken &amp; Biscuit Pie, Rotini w/ Prosciutto with Sugar Snap Peas, Parmesan Corn Bread Twists, Chinese Chicken, Slow-Cooker Chocolate Chip Pudding Cake, and the Mock Cassoulet. Tonight we're trying the Pork Fried Rice.Although I've made primarily entrees from this book, the appetizers look like they'd be delicious and easy to put together. I got this book for Christmas and haven't had an occasion since to make appetizers.I'm going to buy this for all my friends as gifts!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I'm a busy mother of 4 young kids, and I saw this book at the scholastic book fair. After 3 minutes of flipping through it, I decided to buy it and have used it more than all my other cookbooks combined. It's full of shortcuts for making tasty meals. Not fancy gourmet stuff, but easy stuff you can throw together quickly and have it taste great. Just about every recipe I have tried was a hit with my family.I especially like the lists of ways to \\"doctor\\" up basic dishes, like ways to \\"doctor\\" macaroni and cheese, deli chicken, bagged salad greens, etc...If you are busy and don't have much time to fuss around the kitchen but like good food with simple ingredients, then this is the book for you!By the way, I had tried a four ingredient cookbook thinking it would be the end-all be-all easy cookbook, but I found those recipes to fall short. The Dinner Doctor book is much much better."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I love to read cookbooks. Usually, that's all I do with them, thumb through them and set them aside, maybe making one or two of the recipes. When I got this cookbook, I took it to my son's football game and read it during timeouts, etc. Not only was it a good read, but the recipes are perfect for a family on the go who needs ideas here and there for something different. I'm also a cook who isn't afraid to try new things, so some of the recipes give me good ideas and I can adjust them to my family's taste.One of my favorite sections is the appetizers. Our family attends many family social events, and there are several good appetizer recipes that are good to take to parties and get togethers.I think some reviewers are a little harsh in their judgment of this book. If you want a cookbook that has recipes where the ingredients are all from scratch and are low in sodium, calories, fat, etc. then a book from the Dinner Doctor obviously isn't going to be for you! But, if you want a book that will give you a several easy, quick, friend- & family-friendly ideas for use every now and then, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This is a very simple cookbook with mostly very simple recipes. I don't like time-consuming recipes, so I love this book. Most of the ingredients are stuff you will have already in your pantry. It also has a lot of interesting information about cooking in general."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I recieved my copy of this great book 2 days ago. I have read through it and everything sounds wonderful and easy to prepare. So far, I have made the Spaghetti Cassarole and the Beef Stroganoff. I used Venison instead of beef in the Straganoff and it was wonderful! Give this book a try. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I'm really stunned by the reviews this book has gotten here. I've tried a few of the recipes and not only were they not especially quick they were not good at all. It strikes me as a cookbook for people who don't know how to cook and don't know much about good food."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This book is not just full of recipes, it's full of ideas! I love the cake doctor books, and this is no different. Take something convenient and make it taste great.

However, I was disappointed in the Dinner Doctor cookbook.

I loved the macaroni and cheese that added quickness and yummy taste. All the recipes that I tried were hits!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. Her other books were so great but this one did not knock my socks off and it did not inspire me like her other books did."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I found this book at a garage sale for fifty cents. It's going back in my garage sale pile. I read the other less favorable reviews and I agree that there are odd mixes of ingredients that sound fun, but miss the mark when executed. If you are looking for a \\"open a can/box and put a good meal on the table\\" book, may I suggest \\"The Can Opener Gourmet\\" by Laura Karr."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I love the recipes I have tired so far. The meals are easy to prepare. Glad I purchased even after reading mixed reviews. Also helps with budgeting when planning for the meals on a weekly basis."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"The Dinner Doctor is a decent cookbook with many interesting recipes. My main complaint about this collection is that the recipes do not include any nutritional information, although it's pretty easy to tell that most of these recipes will not show up in the pages of Cooking Light, unless it's in the recipe rescue section. That being said, this book is filled with recipes that have good short cuts and Byrn provides many useful hints that are adaptable to more healthier recipes, just don't expect to find any guidance in this book on how to get there."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Bought for newly divorced son who needs some help in the kitchen.We both liked this and I will buy one for myself. Easy reading andcooking!!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I love this cookbook! This cookbook has lots of tasty recipes that reflect the latest trends in cooking, including a variety of ethnic flavors while incorporating convenience foods from the supermarket.I hope she writes another one. This cookbook has become the one I use most often. I was looking for a cookbook with easy tasty recipes to learn before starting a family. Butterscotch pecan saucepan blondies are awesome as well ast he potato chip cookies! The Italian meat loaves recipe is on the regular dinner rotation in my house as well as the oven-roasted salmon with spinach and coconut."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This is a great book, full of ideas on \\"semi-homemade\\" recipes. They all use something that is already prepared. Has great ideas on using deli-style rotisserie chicken. Easy recipes, and healthy too. Lots to pick from, mostly using things you have on hand, which is nice. I bought this because I already had the Cake Mix Doctor, which I use all the time. I was not disappointed by my purchase and you won't be either!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This lady can make a meal out of a mess!! She has wonderful ideas to throw together a good dinner, usually just by using the stuff around the house. Tastes like gourmet food. Gave me some new ideas for dinner, what every mother needs to spice up the dinner table. Easy, tasty recipes. Worth purchasing."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"The part I like best about this book is the pantry list in the back. It prepares your kitchen for any type of quick and delicious meal. I have tried several of the recipes and enjoyed them all."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Full of easy recipes using products that are usually already in my pantry. I think it would be a wonderful cookbook for beginners."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Okay, you were about to open the wine and let it breathe, maybe you were going to saute the shrimp you bought yesterday. A simple delicious meal for two, just you and your husband, when he calls, says he's invited the boss, his wife and two guys from planning and their wives as well over for dinner. It's four-thirty and they're coming at six.What to do? What to do?Well if you've got the Dinner Doctor among your store of cookbooks, you are saved, because Anne Byrn has stuffed her cookbook full of recipes that you can make up quick quick. For example did you know if you ran to the store and bought one of those already cooked chickens that you could turn it into Tuscan Chicken in no time at all, or into Santa Fe Polenta, or maybe a Curried Chicken and Artichoke Casserole. The key here is quick, remember the boss, those guys from planning and their wives are coming soon and you want to look good. Get this book, keep it handy, you'll never be left holding the bag, dinner wise again."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I own all of Ann Byrn's books: The Cake Mix Doctor, The Chocolate Cake Mix Doctor, Cupcakes from the Cake Doctor and the Dinner Doctor. I purchased this book along with the Cupcake book, as wedding shower gifts. It includes appetizers, soups, salads, main meals and even desserts. The book offers alot of friendly tips on cooking or spicing up something bland. Most of the items needed are usually things you have on hand, just add a little attitude to it. The lemon poppy seed cake is one of the best cakes I have ever had and I've made it many times."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I LOVE the Cake Mix and Chocolate Cake Mix Doctor cookbooks - they are truly wonderful and several recipes are now go-to family \\"classics\\" we use over-and-over. Given that, I had high expectations when I received the Dinner Doctor Cookbook. I've had it now for about two years and can say it has truly disappointed. The recipes don't really appeal to everyone, they're more complicated than they should be, and considering there are other alternatives out there (30 Minute Meals, Robin Miller, etc.), this book just disappoints."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I should start by saying that I think Sandra Lee's Semi-Homemade cookbook and her Food Network recipes are beyond disgusting. However, the concept intrigued me. I was told that &quot;The Dinner Doctor&quot; took the same idea, but was several notches above Semi-Homemade in terms of overall quality of recipes and the end result.I had many recipes picked out the first time I read &quot;The Dinner Doctor.&quot; The Pumpkin Orange Soup with Parmesan Toasts was okay, too orangey but I think I might have inadvertently put in too much orange juice.The Winter Night Beef Stew--well, she has you make a traditional beef stew, browning stew meat, adding broth and vegetables and red wine, but then she inexplicably tells you to thicken the stew using...canned beef stew! Ick! I mean, why go to the trouble in the first place to make a nice stew, if you're going to foul it up? Why not just eat the Dinty Moore in the first place? She does say if you don't want to do that, to add more broth and flour and cook it longer. I did that but had to add mashed potato flakes to thicken it in the end. It did taste good.The Sesame Peanut Noodles calls for a cup of red wine vinaigrette. I love peanut sauce. This was foul. Way too sweet because bottled vinaigrette has tons of corn syrup. At the same time, it was too vinegary. Just not even close to an authentic recipe, which is easy in the first place and shouldn't need doctoring.The Chinese Chicken tasted okay but when I added the sauce mixed with cornstarch as directed, it turned into gobs of jellied goo and never did relax and turn into a sauce. Maybe it was my cooking, but I followed the directions exactly.The Chicken Piccata was good; the Black Bean and Vegetable Stack was okay.The Easy Beef Stroganoff called for a packet of onion soup mix, and since the recipe also calls for sour cream, the finished product tasted very strongly like onion dip. My husband liked it, but I couldn't even eat it.The Turkey Hash in a Flash reminded me of the cafeteria food in my grade school in the late '70s. Gross texture, salty yet bland. I wouldn't eat it again and in fact didn't finish my portion.I was going to try more recipes, but got tired of wasting food. I think her overall execution is better than Sandra Lee's, but still leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This book is an absolute godsend to a time pressed kitchen-phobe like me. It has made making and planning dinners easier and &lt;gasp!&gt; FUN!! The Dinner Doctor is just what the doctor ordered for everyday people to make great meals with simple items from the store or items that you already have on hand. I devoured this book when I got it, even my husband was excited about dinnertime again! I highly recommend this book to anyone who works and even those who do not. It has definitely taken everyday food items and made them exciting. And the recipes are easy to follow and in plain english. Anne Bryn also offers helpful tidbits, humor and substitutions along the way for those red meat, cream and butter phobes like myself. In summation--GET THIS BOOK...you (and you family) will be glad you did!!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I didn't have very high hopes for this cookbook when I got it as a gift. I thought it would be unimaginative, uninspired, or at best contain ideas that I probably could have come up with on my own. BOY WAS I WRONG!! Every recipe in this book is interesting and mouthwatering. The dishes are a lifesaver when you are pressed for time in the kitchen. Believe it or not, even your kids will like them!The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because the book didnt contain a nutritional breakdown for the recipes."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I have both of the Cake Mix Doctor books, and when I discovered Anne Byrn had a Dinner Doctor book out, I knew I had to purchase it. Every single recipe I have tried from all of her books has turned out to be fantastic and sooooo easy! Just the other day, from the Dinner Doctor book, I made a wonderfully rich and easy chicken casserole dish that uses canned artichokes, canned mushrooms, sour cream, mayonnaise, and curry powder. Talk about luscious! And all of her recipes use ingredients that can easily be found in your supermarket. I don't have to worry about trying to find a specialty food shop.I hear she has a new cupcake book out now - you can bet I will purchase that book from Amazon to add to my Anne Byrn recipe collection!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I really tried to like this cookbook but the recipes are hit or miss at best. Mom's pot roast with Vidalia onion gravy was a different spin on your every day pot roast. The Souffleed Sweet Potatoes were excellent but the other recipes were awful. The recipes were both bland and time-consuming. Popcorn Soup sounded like a fun idea until you are eating soggy, tough popcorn in your corn chowder. As for the Southern Cranberry Salad, suffice it to say, it was thrown out before my guests could have it for Thanksgiving.For a cookbook, the layout of the book is poor. There should be concise instructions for the cooking part. In this book there is so much extraneous verbiage on the page that it is difficult to follow the recipe. In all, a good premise with poor execution."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one. Every recipe I have tried has been awful. I don't cook with many prepared/boxed foods so maybe it is not a fair judgement. I love the idea of the book for when things are crazy and you want to make something fast and easy but the flavor of the dishes are really bad."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I have cookbooks. I have a LOT of cookbooks. But lately this is the one I've been pulling out again and again. I've been cooking for years, but this cookbook showed me new and creative ways of making quick, EASY meals. Plus, the results are delicious, despite some of the negative reviews that have been posted here.This cookbook gives you lots of ideas for doctoring and dressing up mundane food items. It also has a lot of tips scattered throughout that I've found very helpful. I've tried a couple of the salads and main dishes and they've turned out great! And the appetizers and desserts are fantastic!Whether you're just starting out or have been cooking a long time, give this book a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I certainly wasn't!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I initially saw this cookbook at my public library and checked it out before buying it. There are several recipes that I have marked to try and so far really love the Mexican Lasagna recipe. It's so simple and so yummy. My husband loves this recipe and has requested it often! While there are some recipes I won't most likely try there are lots of great recipes with items that I usually have in my pantry. I am always searching for new recipes to jazz up our dinner fare and this fits the bill! The recipes are simple to follow and easy to make. I would recommend this cookbook to anyone, especially families."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This is the neatest book ever. I got it when I first moved away from home and it kept me eating the home cooked food (that i did myself!!) that i was used too....without burning the kichen down! the recipes are easy and really good, Ann leaves a lot of room to improve upon these recipes once you get more familiar w/ the kichen and gives you lots of helpful tips and variations along the way. I have also purchased this cookbok for lots of my bachelor friends they love it too."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"What a creative, easy-to-use collection of recipes! If you are stressed over what to make for dinner, just whip out the Dinner Doctor and you'll be bursting with ideas in no time! Most of the dishes will come from foods you already have in your pantry or fridge. There are great suggestions for entire menus... check out the Teenagers Party that includes Cheesy Breadsticks and a yummy Tex-Mex style full meal salad. I would suggest picking up an extra copy for a wedding or birthday gift, because you will definitely not want to part with yours!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"What a great idea for a book. I like to write positive things but hopefully this will make me get rid of this book because time and again the recipes are disappointing. I just threw out the whole pan of crockpot macaroni and cheese which cooked up as a tasteless pudding. This is the fourth out of five inedible and unsalvagable recipes I tried this week. The souffle'd sweet potato was blase' texture and not at all a souffle'. An embarrassing failure for my grandkids' springbreak. I did like the cheese blender souffle' but found I could simplify it more. Will stick to Epicurious and other sites where I can read recipe reviews ahead of time to avoid problems.Most seasonings are weak and some of the tips just don't work. Plan to make adjustments to enhance the flavors. I have used the book hints to try to organize simplifications. Many have not worked; like substituting evaporated milk for a white sauce in the macaroni and believing that the pasta wouldn't turn to mush.Another disappointment is the incomplete index. I read one of her hints but couldn't find it in the index when I wanted to make it.Hopefully someone can use the premise & produce a book with better experience, more reliabilty and testing."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I love to cook, and have literally dozens of cookbooks, but this is one of my favorites. In general I prefer to cook completely from scratch and avoid convenience foods, but the recipes in this cookbook are excellent. I have never had one turn out poorly; in fact, every recipe I've made from this cookbook has come out great. I particularly like the Curried Chicken and Artichoke Casserole. It seems that every time I look in this book I see a new recipe I want to try."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Great book for my husband and kids to use to supeise me with dinner and treats. Doesn't get any better!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I already own a couple of the Cake Mix Doctor books and when I saw this book I was curious how The Dinner Doctor compared as it is based on the concept. Here Byrn \\"doctors\\" canned, frozen, boxed, bagged & ready-made deli food to get dinner on the table in a hurry. I must admit thought, that at first I was a bit skeptical that the book would be filled with lots of processed foods just thrown together to make a casserole (not knocking casseroles but I was looking for something a bit different). I was pleasantly surprised to see that many of the convenience foods simply saved me a preparation step rather than being totally processed foods...for example, a bag of coleslaw mix (instead of taking a head of cabbage and bag of carrots and chopping them up myself) or a package of broccoli crowns. She also gives tips for snazzing up prepared deli items to make them your own--like potato salad and adding \\"add-ins\\" like crumbled cooked bacon or stirring in diced pimientos and shredded sharp Cheddar cheese.Every recipe includes an ingredient preparation tip or other helpful kitchen tip. And a quick glance at the recipe shows both a \\"To Prep\\" and \\"To Bake\\" time so you can plan accordingly. Dinner Doctor 101 includes some basic tips for making time in the kitchen and supermarket a little bit quicker--who won't appreciate that?If you're looking for ways to streamline your time in the kitchen (and who isn't), The Dinner Doctor, is a great place to start!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This book makes it easy to whip together a quick meal. I reviewed one of Anne's recipes in depth at [...]I like how the book is divided into easy categories. I especially like the sections with quick ways to improve on store bought foods.

It uses the premise that there are many foods that are prepared or slightly prepared (think already peeled carrots, deli chickens etc) that you can use to make a good meal.The directions are clear and easy to understand, the additional comments are helpful and only clarify any directions. The ingredient needed are generally common ingredients. The end result on every meal I have tried is delicious.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Ms. Byrn has hit the nail on the head with this one. I love the cake mix doctor and converted from being a complete baking snob into a cake mix regular for birthday cakes and special occasion treats. No one knows the diff and the cakes are great. Same goes for the new Dinner Doc. I especially like the cool easy soups that taste so homemade and my family has been aching for some good casseroles for a long time. The hardest part of figuring out dinner to me is wandering through all the new crazy products in the grocery store. This book addresses that and has made me a better shopper and better at adding a little finesse to a meal."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I originaly purchased this book for myself, but after looking through it I realized it was the perfect cookbook for my 24 year old son.

It is a cookbook for families, as well as individuals."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"What a creative, easy-to-use collection of recipes! If you are stressed over what to make for dinner, just whip out the Dinner Doctor and you'll be bursting with ideas in no time! Most of the dishes will come from foods you already have in your pantry or fridge. There are great suggestions for entire menus... check out the Teenagers Party that includes Cheesy Breadsticks and a yummy Tex-Mex style full meal salad. I would suggest picking up an extra copy for a wedding or birthday gift, because you will definitely not want to part with yours!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"This is a good book, lots of good ideas and recipes...I use it a lot. The price was the best anywhere and \\"free shippping\\".Cake Lady"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Often cooks have their specialties, and I think that this is the case with Anne Byrn - her Cake Mix Doctor books are fantastic and yield consistently delicious results. But I have been testing out recipes from The Dinner Doctor for about 3 weeks now, and I have to say that I am a little disappointed.As written, a lot of the recipes in this book don't strike me as good, HEALTHY everyday dinners. Many depend heavily upon condensed soups, shredded cheese, half-and-half or sour cream, and other high-fat ingredients. You can try substituting lower-fat versions of these same products but your results will probably suffer. Other ingredients that are easier to \\"doctor\\" are cooking sprays for all that oil, and canned beans and vegetables that either have no salt added or have been rinsed to get rid of excess salt and other additives.Also, many of the recipes are so basic that they come out tasting very bland. I will probably be hanging onto the Creamy Potato Soup, Mexican Lasagna, and Tomato Basil Tart recipes, but I will also be making a note to add tons of extra herbs and spices for added flavor. (Hints: the soup needs paprika and parsley; the lasagna needs cumin; and the tart needs rosemary.) Unfortunately Anne doesn't give many suggestions for the types of seasonings to add - I had to come up with ideas myself, and frankly I buy cookbooks to cut corners in that department. Flavor is just as important as speed and healthiness in a good everyday meal.Lastly, I got wildly different results as to cooking times with a number of the recipes I tried. I found the rice and pasta slow-cooker dishes I tried came out very mushy from the rice or pasta being left in the cooker too long. Other recipes I found the dish needed to bake longer, or uncovered instead of covered as stated in the recipe.The next cake book Anne Byrn puts out, you can bet I will buy it - but I am just not impressed with The Dinner Doctor."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I received this for Christmas last year, and I have been very impressed with all of the recipes we've tried. Lots of great tips for doctoring all sorts of standards -- marinara sauce, tuna fish, mac and cheese, etc. The recipes are quick to make, and easy to follow. I can't say enough about how much I've enjoyed this cookbook."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Majority of recipes are gourmet-type recipes with ingredients my family would never touch. I was surprised, because I really liked her Cake Mix Doctor Book."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"When we moved into a house with a bigger mortgage and wanted to start eating at home to save money, I started cooking very regularly out of this cookbook. I do not have very much cooking experience and really liked the idea of being able to maximize the availability of boxed, canned, frozen, etc., foods in the grocery stores without losing the ability to serve a variety of foods. This book has definitely not disappointed!Additionally, we like to eat foods from different ethnicities -- Thai, Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican -- and the book has been great for that. Yes, you might have to buy a few ingredients you didn't already have, but if you plan well, you can use them again and again to make sure your money is well-spent. And of course you can adjust your purchases to fit your preferences (organic, low-sodium, low-fat).Really, this book has taken an intimidating idea (really cooking for the first time in my life) and made it doable. We plan our week's meals in advance, buy the ingredients, then just come home after work to 15-30 minutes of cooking time before dinner. So far we have enjoyed the Not So Impossible Moussaka Pie, Thai Spaghetti, Curried Shrimp in a Hurry, the Bleu Cheese Stack and the slow cooker chocolate cake, among others.Simple and delicious, seriously!"},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Anybody can cook using the recipes in this book. She makes it easy to create great meals without having to spend a whole lot of time preparing them. There is such a great variiety of recipes that there really is something for everybody.

With all of the pre-washed salad-in-a-bag available now, these recipes make preparation a snap. I like the variety, and of course, the easy and quick preparation. She has included a nice palette of flavors to help get me out of my salad rut! I do, however, wish there were pictures to provide serving ideas. The way food looks is important to me."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I love this book and have made several items from it. Anne's recipes are very easy and always seem to turn out.

It is supposed to be tailor-made for someone like me, I suppose, who could use some easy, quick recipes for those uninspired evenings when dinner looms. But I find that these recipes call for ingredients I would not have on hand, and the shortcuts are off-putting. You need so much grocery-store-prepared food to pull these recipes off, it seems. I'd rather cook simply from a few scratch ingredients. Besides quality control issues, grocery-store-made foods are expensive. And usually pretty bad health-wise (salty & sugary.)I was given this book as a gift and I have enjoyed reading it, but I find it wordy and overwhelming. I don't find it practical, or very enticing. I made the angel hair pasta with roasted red pepper sauce (p. 272) and it sorely needed salt, more moisture (I used chicken stock) and Parmesan cheese to bring it to life.I'm sorry, but I think this book will be in my next give-away pile."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"Expertly written by Anne Byrn (the nationally known &quot;Cake Mix Doctor&quot; and author of a number of bestselling cookbooks), The Dinner Doctor is a time and money saving guide to creating delicious meals on the go utilizing convenient supermarket foods.

I just received this book through amazon's used books and I'm highly disappointed. Most of the recipes that sound good to me ask for ingredients that I don't necessarily have in my pantry stock. That means one needs more planning for the recipes, shopping for specific ingredients, etc. - which means they aren't that QUICK."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I thought the Cake Mix Doctor by this author was just great. How could this book be such a dud? I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dinner Doctor","review":"I like the dessert-related Doctor books, but this book did not appeal to me at all. In fairness, I cannot say if the recipes were good or bad because I didn't actually cook anything in this book... none of the recipes appealed to me enough to do so. Most looked boring or unappetizing... is a recipe for pork fried rice really necessary? Poppy Seed Chicken Casserole sounds yucky. Despite the book's substantial size, there are not that many entree ideas which is what I was looking for. There is a chapter devoted to pastas, but other books such as While the Pasta Cooks have much more appetizing recipes that can be prepared quickly from fresh ingredients. A big section of the book is devoted to desserts, which is territory already covered by Byrn's other Doctor tomes.People with busy lifestyles would be much better off using quick and healthy recipes from Cooking Light or some other publication. Byrn should stick with desserts."},{"Title":"Marriages and Families: Diversity and Change","review":"This book provides a general educational foundation to the subject.

I do dislike how whenever they are speaking about people from both sexes, the purposely always list she before he. \\"She or he is likely to ...\\" \\"She or he sometimes may feel...\\" Why not go s/he, that seems pretty acceptable to me. Or he, then she, since that's alphabetical. Or mix it up and do both, but it's a purposeful action in this book to put female before male.I just fail to see the worth of the text. Why do I need to read a chapter on Living Single, Living With Others? Or Dating, Coupling, and Mate Selection. Or The Marriage Experience.What did this book teach me? Well, I now know such important things as the \\"developmental family life cycle theory\\", which pays close attention to changes in families over time and attempts to explain family life in terms of a process that unfolds over the life course of families? Huh? Really, who cares? The text is obsessed with trying to explain things, and give names and theories and terms to what I just refer to as \\"life\\". Everyone lives life a different way. Live and let live I say, and quit analyzing it. If two gay people have a kid, good for them. Why delve into it? If two straight people have a kid, good for them. If a grandmother lives with the family, who cares? Why is an entire book dedicated to this?Sadly, most of those probably reading reviews on this book are students who will be required to buy it. So my advice, buy it, use it, resell it. If you happen to be a professor of sociology, put aside your personal feelings about my or other negative reviews, read the book cover to cover, and ask yourself if it really taught you anything, or enlightened you in anyway. I wish my professor had."},{"Title":"Marriages and Families: Diversity and Change","review":"I was a little nervous to buy this because I have never bought anything on Amazon especially a used text book but when it came in I was so happy.

In this book I found three very well placed arguments for Gospel authorship and priority. As is becoming the standard with multiple view books, each author presents their case and the other contributors to the book respond to the main writing. Each writer gets a chance to write their own argument and refute the others' arguments in a short response.The authors involved are Grant Osborne, Matthew Williams, John Niemela, David Farnell and the editor, Robert Thomas. The last three earning their PhD/ThD from Dallas Theological Seminary with Drs. Osbourne and Williams gaining their PhDs the University of Aberdeen and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.Drs. Williams and Osborne begin with the case for Markan Priority (MH), or the belief that evidence shows Mark was written first with Matthew and Luke relying on Mark's Gospel as a source. This argument concentrates on the examples of textual similarity between Matthew and Luke to Mark. His conclusion is that MH does not answer the whole question and that the truth behind this topic may not be answered before the Second Coming.Dr. Niemela displays the Two Source Hypothesis. He takes an interesting stance by using statistics to show the proposed similarities ssurrounding MH are not as significant as they are proposed to be. He also relies heavily on historical queues pointing to Matthew's initial writing.Dr. Farnell takes the traditional historical stance in his defense of the Independent Hypothesis. This theory is often not discussed in scholarly circles because it is a foregone conclusion by many that the Gospels used sources and relied upon each other.Each scholar presents a detailed and thorough argument of their beliefs. MH is by far the foremost theory, with the 2GH making a comeback recently. As stated previously, IH is not a highly regarded theory in scholarly circles despite its longstanding run in church history. It is by far the most prominent belief in Christianity, because it is the belief of lay-Christianity.The authors do a superb job of covering the topic. Dr. Thomas sums up the evidence in a summary chapter after all the authors have debated. I would highly recommend this book to curious Christians and seminary students to get a superb introduction to the major aspects of Synoptic Gospel origins. This would also serve well as a reference for these arguments including the novel argument using statistics."},{"Title":"Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels","review":"A major debate in New Testament studies over the past two hundred years is the \\"Synoptic Problem.\\" This problem observes the differences between the three Synoptic Gospel (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) and seeks to reconcile them. There are three categories where variations often occur: wording, content, and order. \\"Wording\\" refers to the specific Greek words chosen by each evangelist. \\"Content\\" refers to the thematic \\"pericopes\\" (literary units) that each author chose to include or exclude. \\"Order\\" refers to the specific sequence that Matthew, Mark, and Luke elected to arrange their Gospels.Differences in these categories have great significance because they affect our view of Scripture in vital areas such as biblical inspiration, inerrancy, and perspicuity. They determine precisely who Jesus is and what words He spoke. Furthermore, they shape one's entire method of interpretation of the Synoptic Gospels. In short, the Synoptic Problem strikes at the very heart of the Christian faith, reflecting what we believe about God and His Word. \\"In large part, the answers to who Jesus really was depend upon how one approaches the first three Gospels - Matthew, Mark, and Luke - which in turn depends upon how the three books came into being\\" (13).So how should these differences be reconciled? In this book, the three most common views are articulated and defended. Grant R. Osborne and Matthew C. Williams join forces to present the \\"Two-/Four-Source View.\\" John H. Niemel&auml; advocates the \\"Two Gospel View.\\" And F. David Farnell heralds the \\"Independence View.\\" Thomas, as editor, presides over the discussion by offering a basic introduction to the subject and concludes with a summary of all arguments and responses. He states that the overarching purpose of the book is to \\"help individuals sort through issues and controversies that relate to the first three Gospels\\" with the ultimate goal of \\"strengthening the body of Christ\\" (18). In my estimation, Farnell makes the strongest case.This is a helpful book on a complex subject that really helps untangle the synoptic problem. One unfortunate aspect is that the authors do not have an opportunity to rebut their opponent's responses, leaving some arguments unanswered."},{"Title":"Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels","review":"I bought this book for my son when he was in seminary.

Hill delivers a quality story that competes with the best authors in the genre and certainly didn't disappoint this reader.On the surface, the story is reminiscent of something from Jackie Calhoun. The protagonists are an attractive married woman (Susan) -- who is currently going through a divorce - and an irresistible lesbian (Shawn). Of course Susan leaves her husband for Shawn, but this wouldn't be a lesbian romance otherwise. This is all true on the surface. However, Hill incorporates Susan's worst nightmare --her family-- into the mix.There is Ruth, Susan's older sister, who appears very prudish and shallow at first blush. But there is actually much more to Ruth and this reader felt sorry for her by the end. Susan's mother pokes her nose in as well, but she's less intrusive than Ruth. Then there is Susan's supportive daughter who reveals something new about herself as well. Contrast that with Shawn's dysfunctional, non-existent family and her rocky past. Shawn has secrets of her own that she feels compelled to share with Susan.As the two women alternately console each other through emotional times, their budding friendship becomes much more complicated. It is this emotional journey that truly keeps the reader engaged and makes this book a must read. Highly recommended as a permanent addition to your personal collection."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"Gerri Hill has a way with writing love scenes!

All her books are the same, only the names and occupations change. She's had about six books come out in the last year... maybe if she spent more time on each one and wrote one a year she'd give us some characters that are more than 1 dimensional and some plots that are fully fleshed-out."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"If you liked Gulf Breeze and the \\"banter\\" between the characters, you'll love Dawn of Change. Once again, this author puts you in the same room as her characters, making you feel as if you're eavesdropping, wondering if you should make a quick exit before they catch you! The ease at which Hill moves the story from friendship to romance is so subtle, you, like the characters, will be surprised when it smacks you in the face! There is also a delicious character to hate, Aunt Ruth! She'll have you gritting your teeth, (a la Alexis Carrington from the old Dynasty series), and wishing someone would smack her already! The setting for this story is the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, which adds to the simple, relaxed format. It wasn't until I read it for the second time that I realized the entire book takes place on weekends over one summer. Added bonus: Alex the dog is too cute for words!"},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"I'm new to reading lesbian romances, so I've been trying to catch up on lost time by reading lots of them. I bought this story because it seems like the author is very popular. Perhaps she has written better books. I found this one very predictable and rather trite.I think the story had plenty of potential, with Susan discovering herself after a long marriage, and Shawn trying not to get involved with a straight woman who might break her heart. But the characters seemed superficial to me and I found their romance didn't hold my interest.The writing is pleasant and well polished but it feels stale and unoriginal. Overall, I thought this book was a nice romance but it's only mediocre compared to some that I've read recently."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"Gerri Hill has delivered a heart pounding, tension-filled romance that will leave you breathless through the last page. Dawn of Change is a story of discovery- a different kind of coming out story where damaged hearts take a chance again and first loves are realized.Susan, the \\"perfect\\" wife and mother, escapes to the mountains after she finds her husband of 20 years in bed with a much younger woman. There she literally runs into Shawn while hiking. Susan invites Shawn to dinner on the spur of the moment because she is lonely. They strike up a friendship that includes regular dinners with conversations, sharing their pasts. Every weekend that Shawn camps in the mountains, she spends time with Susan. By the end of the summer, they have become best friends. But without telling each other, they both begin to have more than friendly feelings towards the other. Shawn does not want to become involved with a straight woman on the rebound. Susan is questioning whether her feelings are real.While I find most lesbian/straight romances in novels suspect, Dawn of Change is believable. Hill develops their friendship throughout most of the book. Through the characters' visits with each other and their family encounters at Susan's cabin, Hill illustrates beautifully their individual emotional struggles with their current situations and their pasts. As Susan and Shawn get to know one another so does the reader. This process occurs over several months, not just a week or two.Hill builds her characters gradually, making their relationship realistic and natural. Susan and Shawn as friends support each other's choices, and that gives each woman more confidence to make independent decisions. Hill creates believable histories that flow well with the storyline.With Dawn of Change the secrets are shed, the souls are bared, and the hearts slowly open. The reader will find it difficult to stop reading until the very last word."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"I've read three other books by this author and now that I've read this one as well, I get that she can really only write one story and a couple of characters. Her romances all seem the same. It's obvious that she's emulated the lightly humorous style of Karin Kallmaker, so her writing is pleasant and entertaining even though it's not original. All her books have well written and interesting settings, although not in the same league as a Jennifer Fulton, Marianne K. Martin or Sarah Waters setting. But Dawn of Change lets down these good features of its authors writing in every other way. I got the feeling that this book was popped out in too big of a hurry. Susan and Shawn seem like they came off a production line and their romance doesn't have enough emotional depth to be satisfying. Because this book is slightly better written than the typical dyke romance I guess plenty of readers will be satisfied with it. But compared with the genuine 5 star lesbian romances out there, it's fast food that's been sitting under the heat lamps way too long."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"Gerri Hill certainly doesn't disappoint with this one, her fourth book. Watching the friendship form between Shawn and Susan is very refreshing. It just seems so easy and comfortable. The relationship grows and the passion is wonderful. However, there are plenty of twists and turns along the way to romance. Susan's family is full of surprises, but Shawn has a few surprises of her own. When you finish this book, you will find yourself sighing with contentment. Yes, it's that good. Dawn Of Change is an excellent read. If you have not yet read a a book by Gerri Hill, I'm sorry. You're really missing out. I've always been extremely satisfied with Gerri's books, and I'm really looking forward to Hunter's Way in May."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"This is the 1st book I have read by Gerri Hill and I sat down down with it and read it straight through. Then I read it again. Now I am rereading the parts that I really like :-)I absolutely love when an author can grab your attention and leave you wanting. The writing and characters are phenomenal!!!!Thank you."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"Susan has walked out of her marriage after catching her husband in their bed with a 20-something woman. She escapes to the couple's cabin in the King's Canyon National Park. One day, while walking one of the trails, a dog bounds across the river to shake muddy cold water all over her. The dog's owner, Shawn, apologizes, and that seems to be the end of their encounter. But you have to know that with a Gerri Hill book, that is only the beginning.In this outing, Hill takes a very married, but basically unhappy, woman and shows how she deals with the end of a 20-year marriage, with her family, and with new friends. There are many sub-plots in this book, but the one you love to hate is the sub-plot involving Susan's sister and mother who are insistent that she return to her husband and their life in society. The sub-plot you love to love is Susan's daughter's coming out.This is one of Hill's stronger outings. She doesn't rush Susan's angst over ending her marriage nor does she rush the obvious attraction Susan begins to feel toward Shawn. Once again, Hill develops characters that you'd like to know better."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"Gerri captures her audiance rather quickly. Yes we have all heard the stories about a woman who is leaving a marriage and finds her self attracted to a lesbian. However, Hill focuses on the positive side of a healthy relationship. She incorporated communication, clarification, assertiveness and loving someone unconditionally. The book included a well written erotic love scene! Not many lesbian writers risk writing a scene like this. Hill took the erotic love scene and slowed it way down. Each explicit detail could be visualized and felt by the reader! It is a romantic, caring love story. One not to be forgotten...(especially the love scene).If I could change something about the book it would be how the beer in the back of Shawn's truck seemed to have a character all it's own. Enough already."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"This was an easy weekend read that had a lot of elements I see repeatedly in Gerri Hill. Her couples are always among my favorites in lesfic romance, but I have some mixed feelings about this couple and found the second half of the book much better than the first half.This one follows a 39 yr old married mom from Fresno, California (I think) who hides out in her Kings Canyon mountain cabin as she contemplates issues with her husband and married life in general. When cabin fever sets in, socialite Susan Sterling finds herself assertively befriending a 33 yr old outdoorsy short-haired dyke (Shawn Weber) and her dog that she meets along the mountain trails. They bond amidst the isolation and become honest friends. On the way, Susan struggles to make sense of inevitable change, deals with the homophobia that emerges with her first lesbian friend, and is lucky Shawn's experience volunteering full-time in a woman's shelter makes her such a good listener with a whole lot of patience.I like the premise. I love following Gerri's uptight straight femmes as they discover themselves, fall for the sexy soft butch... and beg to be taken in the end!! lol. I never get tired of them in her stories. But this one is the least sexy femme-side lead in her stories that I've come across so far (except when she's begging! ahaha). Had Susan been more appealing and had her family been less irritating (or at least given less story time), I'd probably rate this one higher. Unfortunately, Shawn describes Susan as very \\"middle-aged\\" and married looking for 39... which translated as kinda old and haggard looking and I had a hard time reconciling with this depiction even though she seems to blossom with youthful energy and looks as the story progresses. Heck, I don't even know what her hair color was!! ... not enough description on Susan at all. I also kept getting these characters confused since both of their names started with an \\"S.\\" The first half of the book was just slower and full of a whole lot of blah characterizations... way too much obnoxious family time.These characters also drink a whole lot, lol. I haven't seen Gerri's characters drink this much since Sierra City... they are pulling out a beer and pouring wine on every other page, lol. I'm not anti booze or anything and every time Gerri's characters start drinking (they always do) I always think she would probably be some fun company, lol... but these characters must be perpetually buzzed. They also smoke... one does pretty much as often as she drinks. Sure don't see that too often in lesfic.Some things I did like about the book is that the slow transition/awakening of this married woman was paced and developed very realistically. This is a very good coming out story for someone with a married start in life and I think readers who share this drama will identify well. Though I'm happy to report there is no het intimacy the lesbos have to sit through. And for whatever issues I had with the first half of the story... the sex between these leads more than made up for it. Very hot!!! Always one of my favorite perks in reading Gerri Hill... she never disappoints in the bedroom. And Gerri is one of those writers who can put a dog in most scenes and still doesn't make a farce of her story with cutsey talking dogs who bring the leads together and make shameless emotional appeals to the reader. Totally organic dog presence.So there are country clubs in Fresno?! lol. I always pictured this city as the Oakland of the Central Valley..."},{"Title":"Dawn Of Change","review":"What more is there to say? Gerri Hill again came out with a fabulous story.

After graduating from Harvard, he throws himself into a career as a history teacher, taking every opportunity to coax history to life for his students and acquaintances on Boston's richly historical coast. At every opportunity, he uses costume and prop to enhance his wonderful storytelling gift.When he takes a summer job as a tour guide to local historic spots, he keeps tourists spellbound with his tales. Routinely, while telling a ghost story about The Lady in Black, he stands by a black casket. As he spins the yarn, the casket, as he ignores it, slowly creaks open, to the horror of onlookers, and a black clad woman rises--the ghost herself! An experience not soon forgotten!Over time, he is intrigued by the history of the local lighthouses, and becomes acquainted with the lighthouse keepers and their families. He writes and has published their amazing stories. And it's clear to him, from the beginning, their dedication to keeping the lights burning also keeps them isolated, especially over long, frigid winters.It isn't by chance that he meets a student, Bill Wincapaw, whose father, Captain Wincapaw gives Ed the chance of a lifetime, the chance to make history himself.The captain invites Ed to ride along while they drop Christmas packages from a plane--to the excited lighthouse keepers and their families below.From the first trip, Ed is hooked, returning year after year. When, after a few years, the student and his father move away, they bequeath to Ed the revered position of Flying Santa. But it's a [costly] proposition.Ill-equipped to learn to fly, he and his wife, Anna Myrle, commit themselves to putting aside part of his small teaching salary each year to fund the gift purchases, special packaging, and the plane rental. No new car or nicer house for them. And each year, the tradition grows more precious to those Ed and Anna Myrle, dressed as Santa and Mrs. Claus, bless with their inexpensive, yet priceless gifts. They drop packages filled with treasures--balloons, books, pencils, paper, magazines, candy, coffee and small toys, things the grateful families can ill afford.As one of Ed's students, Tommy Gibbons has been a problem from the beginning. Always failing in school, and in trouble due to his violent temper, Tommy has made it clear he has no use for Ed's love of history, nor later, his flying Santa routine.When Tommy, now a dangerous adult bully, confronts Ed, threatening his family, Santa begins to doubt the value of his commitment.Ironically, Tommy is forced, as a punishment, to spend a year serving as lighthouse keeper on a tiny, lonely island off Boston's coast. How will he respond to Santa now?Though Ed, Anna Myrle and the lighthouse keepers are gone now, the legacy of The Flying Santa lives on to this day, bringing hope when it's needed most.As a lover of history, this reviewer found this story both endearing and memorable. Bernie Schallehn and John Galluzzo bring the charm of the past to vivid life, making you fall in love with their vibrant characters, people who actually lived and made their indelible mark on history. For those of us who fondly recall the past as a time when loving our neighbors was the 'in' thing to do, this tale will warm your heart.A wonderful story of one small endeavor to change the world, through good times and lean, this one is truly unforgettable.Hats off to Schallehn and Galluzzo for a remarkable and memorable story--a real keeper to curl up with on a cold winter night."},{"Title":"Santa of the Lighthouses","review":"A very delightful and heartwarming book.There are many examples in life of how certain people are able to capture the true essence of giving to others. Edward Snow was one of them.The happiness and joy that Edward brought to the lighthouse keepers and their familes was priceless."},{"Title":"Ismet Inonu: Turkish Democrat and Statesman (Social, Economic and Political Studies of the Middle East and Asia)","review":"Atat&uuml;rk (1880-1938) is one of the most renowned individuals of his time, and rightly so, for he founded the modern state of Turkey and created one of the very few ideologies not just to endure the century but to have considerable successes to its credit. Turks celebrate his accomplishments to his day, with his face of the money and on portraits throughout the country. His legacy is especially powerful in the military officer corps; according to one account, &quot;It would not be an exaggeration to say that cadet-officers hardly spend an hour without mentioning his name.&quot; Even in English, many volumes of biography celebrate his life.But what of his No. 2, Ismet In&ouml;n&uuml; (1884-1973)? In&ouml;n&uuml; served Atat&uuml;rk as the chief of staff who helped win his most decisive battles (against the Greeks), as diplomat in his most important treaty (Lausanne, 1923), as prime minister during his entire presidency (1924-38), and then as his successor as president (1938-50), later to return again to power as prime minister (1961-65). In a first-class biography, Heper (a professor at Bilkent University in Istanbul) performs the important service of recalling this key figure's life from the wrongful obscurity into which it has fallen. Heper finds there is much to admire in his biographee, calling him a pragmatist, an optimist, and a &quot;statesman par excellence.&quot; He particularly praises the intelligent and realistic way In&ouml;n&uuml; guided the country from Atat&uuml;rk's benevolent despotism to a multi-party democracy whose first election he lost and thereupon gracefully went into the opposition; indeed, In&ouml;n&uuml; went so far as to call his defeat his &quot;greatest victory&quot;). Heper quotes one assessment that Turkey has undergone three revolutions this century, a national one led by Atat&uuml;rk, a democratic one led by In&ouml;n&uuml;, and an economic one led by Turgut &Ouml;zal; he then adds that In&ouml;n&uuml;'s role was larger than this implies, having had a direct hand in the first and having helped to pave the way for the third. He deserves this excellent biography.Middle East Quarterly, December 1999"},{"Title":"Ismet Inonu: Turkish Democrat and Statesman (Social, Economic and Political Studies of the Middle East and Asia)","review":"Unfortunately, this turned out to be a wasted opportunity to describe and analyze the actions of a critical leader of Turkey. Ismet's genius was in temporing Ataturk during the transformation of Turkey, but also guiding Turkey through WWII and the creation of multiparty politics. Too bad none of those actions were even described in this work. Apparently this author proceeds from the premise that words are more important that actions. In an age of euphomism, the critical reader will see that all sorts of actions can be sheilded or &quot;spun&quot; with just the right speech. Whether that occurred with Ismet is not regarded. Too bad. We will have to wait for someone else to take up the challenge."},{"Title":"Ismet Inonu: Turkish Democrat and Statesman (Social, Economic and Political Studies of the Middle East and Asia)","review":"This is a bad review. And this is a good book.It is so to the extent that one acceptsthis contingent 'good' and 'bad' as a criteria at all. The reader will find this booksatisfying certain criteria, that is a historical analysis of a particular figure in Turkish political life.Yet however, the reader, if is critical, and if does not acceptthe unnoticed value judgements within a text and the power relation between the author-text-reader, even if not mentioned, will celebrate the realization to say that this is a classical text that has a modernist attitude, marginalizing 'differences', searching for the center that holds, a 'cartesian' anxiety to bring history to the present by claims to hold the universal sovereign truth, hence the undergoing power relation within the text.Out of the 'matrix' will this review sound, to the reader who is not familiar with Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault. I recommend this book as a case study for those who are familiar with such philosophers and hope other readers to go in the opposite direction.I was a student of Metin Heper during my initial graduate studiesand I will suggest a 'richer' argument of my review of another person, who I am currently a student of.See Richard Ashley, &quot;Living on BorderLines: Man, Poststructuralism and War&quot;inJames Der Derian, Michael Shapiro eds.&quot;International/Intertextual Relations&quot;."},{"Title":"Works of the Holy Ghost","review":"Any of the Verbal Bean books will provide you what you need.

Originally published in 1987 and in the same format as Kashiwabara's 1989Matchbook Art. Both books have chapters devoted to covers for hotels, advertising, diners, travel and more. Both perhaps suffer from the same visual problem in just showing the front rather than the whole book open and flat so the front and back can be seen.Chronicle, who published Kashiwabara's book, had a second bite with the 2006Striking Images: Vintage Matchbook Cover Artwith five hundred covers which I think was ruined because the covers were too large (it really showed up the crude printing) and butted together on each page. 'Close cover' fortunately doesn't have this problem and the pages look fresh and interesting thanks to designer Rod Dyer and Jim Heiman.If you enjoy looking at cheap printed ephemera from the past the book is fascinating. I could well see the look of some of these covers popping up in today's retro graphics.

From the first page, I was riveted by this book. The author's descriptions are poetic - the sounds of the words alone descibe the scene. The characters are phenomenal - I continually found myself loving a character and being disgusted by the same character at the same time or despising an evil character but feeling sympathy simultaneously. I continually was amazed that this kept happening. As I read further, I realized there is so much more than appears at the surface. And if you're a suspense lover like I am, you'll find that the surface alone will be enough. Beneath the surface there is a psychological drama being played out that peels back the layers of the novel's town - and I began to get the feeling that this story could be about anyone's town. This book is a must read - it's tension-filled, gritty, poetic, visceral and ultimately overpowering. I could not put it down and I found it to be a steady, tension-filled, march to a poignant creschendo. I have recommended this book to friends and I am receiving the same reports.

She has some baggage, sure. She realizes she has baggage, wonders what she can do to heal, but never does anything! Her problems are never solved within herself-- A man comes along and &quot;rescues&quot; her, magically transforming her into someone her family can be proud of.I would have preferred a story about a woman living in excess, who learns to be strong and pull herself out of the mire by looking within.

She finds it difficult to live up to the expectations of her &quot;perfect&quot; aunt and uncle and their &quot;normal&quot; children. Fiona is now 30, and her recklessness, unfounded trust in people, and poor judgment has earned her a reputation as an impulsive flake. She apparently sleeps with every man who crosses her path, and the book opens with her waking up and not knowing who is in her bed.But in spite of her poor judgment and many mistakes, Fiona is basically a good person and wants to help people. There is a real dichotomy between her basically good inner self and her outward appearance and actions. She is working as a waitress in the town diner, but wants to complete her education, so is taking a night class at the local college. She is surrounded by men who use her in so many ways. Patrick Grady is cruel and unstable as a result of injuries in Vietnam, and she believes him to be her father. Todd Prescott is her longest relationship (since high school), but he is wealthy and spoiled, and is constantly getting bailed out by his parents. George Grimshaw is the loyal and steady friend since high school, and former boyfriend of her cousin Elizabeth. She also becomes involved with Rudy, her cousin's fianc&eacute;. Her uncle Charles is a respected and prominent judge and is always helping out others, but can't seem to give Fiona the love and support she really needs.The intricacies of the relationships between all of these people make for interesting reading. You keep wondering what dilemma Fiona will find herself in next, and how she can extricate herself. The situation with her alleged father, Patrick Grady, deteriorates and becomes frightening, and the mystery of who he really is and his motivations will keep you engrossed until the end."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"what a book. i could not put it down. mary mcgarry morris has done it again. fiona is lovable, hateful, smart, stupid, sexy, all rolled into one and then some. fiona,s family friends, and enemies are all characters that make it impossible to forget.ms morris is an exceptional , gifted writer. she continues to create characters that have a lasting impression on the reader. i am once again amazed by her ability make her books seem so alive. great work."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Fiona was too available to any man who asked for she didn't value herself.I believe the ending was too pat yet you had to be glad that Fiona finallyfound her way with the help of someone who cared about her."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I almost didn't read this book because it started out slow and uninteresting, so I read the last page, before returning it to the library. For some reason I decided to continue reading and became completely hooked. I'm not going to give a synopsis of the book because many people have already done that and I don't think it is necessary. Even though I did read the last page before continuing on it didn't tell me everything. OK, the clues are abundant in this book and I have figured out a good bit of where it is going. I have figured out who Fiona's father really is but I haven't completely figured out what happened to her mother. For some reason I am finding it impossible to ignore this book and am enjoying it, except for the incredible number of typos and the repetitious use of \\"she bit her lip\\", \\"he bit his lip.\\" Far too much lip-biting and I find it very annoying that the author doesn't seem to be able to come up with a more realistic way to describe the character when he/she is upset, angry, etc. How many people in real life do you see always biting their lip? See, just a small but annoying detail. This is not the best book I've ever read but it's a better than average read. I read \\"A Dangerous Woman\\" but have not read any of the author's other books. Maybe I should try another one to see if it is better than \\"Fiona Range.\\""},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"In general I liked this book. There was something about it that reminded me of Richard Russo's work. It told an interesting (albeit predictable) story. Fiona is definitely a flawed character, but I found myself rooting for her.That's not to say that the book does not have problems. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are numerous typos - far too many. Also, there are too many repetitive scenes with too much repetitive dialogue. How many times did we have to read about Patrick calling Fiona and leaving messages about needing to talk to her, or conversations between Elizabeth and Fiona that started out pleasantly enough but ended with Fiona's outrage, only to have the next conversation between them be the exact same way. There was also a problem with the chapters. Each chapter contained several breaks, which was fine, but where there should have been a break, none existed. It definitely hurt the flow of the story.I also think that Morris was a little unfair to her main character. I think she tried at times to make her more screwed up and unlikable then she needed to be. For example, Fiona tells Rudy she loves him, they have sex, she feels guilty, tells him she doesn't love him, then tries to seduce him, only to be hurt by his rejection (which again was repetitive, since the same thing happened with George.)I'll give this one three stars. It needed to be shortened by about 100 pages to be a five star book."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I picked this up on the bargain bin, and it was a good little read. I got a little annoyed with Fiona for always being the victim. Seems like it would be easier to just pick up and go somewhere where no one thinks that you are the worst thing around. But it was entertaining nonetheless."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I found that I was able to predict the ending very early on as well. I did find it hard to put down though. I did not, however, like the clean, happy ending. Givin the amount of psychological problems that the main character has or probably has, it doesn't seem to fit."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After reading this book, it is hard to understand how it received so many off color reviews. This book was amazing and nearly impossible to put down. Fiona was such a compelling and real character -- she said the things we all sometimes want to say, but cannot. True, she made many mistakes, with 20-20 hindsight, but this was a character who had been rejected, lied to, used and abused for most of her life. This book would make a great movie. It is about someone who never gives up, even if everyone else seems to have never believed in her. I wish there were more books like this out there -- with the happy ending."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Where do I start? At the beginning of course. Fiona's character jumps off the page from the start, in fact her life was thrilling to the end of the novel. Morris once again paints a complete portrait of a woman. By the time I finished I felt I knew Fiona inside and out. If she waited on me at the local diner here in town, I'd spot her before I read her nametage. But it wasn't just Fiona. This book is packed with 3-dimensional characters. The judge-what a crafty, yet somehow still respectable man. (By the way, has anyone stopped to follow how Morris portrays judges in her four novels? That would be an interesting essay itself) His wife, Aunt Arlene-keeping up appearances no matter the cost. Dear Elizabeth-Almost as complex a character as Fiona. Get this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Repetitive, silly, ridiculous, tedious, monotonous....if you've started reading this book, do yourself a favor and just skip to the 2 last chapters and save yourself some valuable time. Thank goodness I got mine at the library and didn't waste my money."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Once again, Mary McGarry Morris has given us a masterpiece of gut-wrenching, hilarious/tragic writing that is not to be put down until it comes roaring to a cymbal-crashing halt. Her photograph on the inside back cover tells me that she has suffered like her quirky heroines - her eyes look sad.I could identify with this particular protagonist more than any of the people in her other books (though my favorite Morris work is 'Vanished'). What I loved about this is Morris's total skewering of &quot;peppy,&quot; &quot;upbeat,&quot; &quot;traditional&quot; families - the whole &quot;family values&quot; hoo-ha. She just layered dysfunction upon dysfunction in this book and had me cracking up or crying all the way. Poor Fiona. Though both my parents were alive and known to me growing up, I often felt like the &quot;poor relation&quot; or &quot;odd pet&quot; of my family. The &quot;secret&quot; was that my popular, lovey-dovey parents were deeply insecure and financially unstable and took out their problems on their children by abusing them and belittling them privately, while putting on a &quot;happy face&quot; publicly.I also loved the jaundiced eye Fiona turned on her family's &quot;good deeds&quot; that brought them such public acclaim but which were actually smokescreens to cover the brutal dysfunction underlying their apparent saintliness. I had that in my family, too - the &quot;you can never give too much&quot; attitude that I consider a hallmark of co-dependency. I wonder if it is also a New England thing, since I was brought up not far from where Morris (or Fiona Range) lives.I have only one criticism, and I also voiced it after I read &quot;Songs.&quot; It is this: I felt the ending was too pat - I won't give it away here. But I am a writer myself and I felt that the endings of &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; and &quot;Vanished&quot; were much more satisfying - as a writer I felt they were perfectly &quot;true&quot; - &quot;real&quot; - whatever. But I do see where Morris was coming from. I guess I just wanted something a little, say, &quot;richer.&quot; My husband, upon hearing my complaint, said (channeling Steve Martin) &quot;Well, EXCU-U-U-SE ME!&quot;, taking Morris's side. He heard me chuckling and sighing all week as I ploughed happily through this book, and feels I'm quibbling with a great piece of literature.In any case, my heartfelt thanks to MMM, who is truly one of America's greatest living storytellers."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I liked Fiona Range, the character, from the very beginning. She's having a melt-down; she's on the brink of discovering who she really is, who she wants to be, and where she came from; she's unapologetic, funny, brash; she's a genuinely good person who doesn't always do the &quot;good&quot; thing. Fiona--the promise of the character--is very human, very accessible. But the execution of her self-discovery is not only disappointing, but lame. Instead of working on her from the inside, sorting her out piece by piece, the author makes Fiona's self-discovery seem like a tv-movie-of-the-week plot: Bad girl (who is really a good girl deep down) wants to change, can't seem to make it happen, blames all her bad luck on everyone else until Good boy (who can be bad because, after all, he cheats on his fiance) tells her he loves her (I actually missed the part where she felt anything for him but pity) and eventually &quot;saves&quot; her from herself (at least that's what we assume). Frankly, Fiona only ends up with him because he ends up with her. Not very interesting.There are some interesting characters in the book that also had potential--Elizabeth, Fiona's cousin, whose physical and emotional deterioration because she can't make decisions was purposely frustrating to read; Patrick, a Vietnam vet Fiona befriends and steadfastly defends; and the diner characters--but in the end, they're just as hollow as Fiona.Overall, not her best work."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"For some reason, I was completely taken with this book. I hate sappy, romantic stories or ones that have overly depressing endings. As a 30 year old like Fiona (though married), I really connected to this character. Fiona is more like a beloved old friend who keeps doing things that really tick me off. Her actions often seem completely rash from the reader's perspective. However, having made irrational, highly emotional choices myself (what woman hasn't?), I find Fiona Range to be the only book I've ever read with a main character that could easily be someone I know or, to some extent, me. And, the best part, the author presents her story without judging Fiona. The reader is allowed to do that herself. I am still recommending this to my friends. I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"This is the story of a 30 year old waitress who hasn't done anything with her life and seems to do nothing but cause problems. I enjoyed reading this book but wish that it wasn't so transparent. Mary is a gifted writer but this book needed a little more meat and some speed to it.This short review comes from a reader who's favorite books include, She's come undone, White Oleander, Amy and Isabel and loved the Bridget Jones'"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Poor Fiona Range. If only people would LISTEN to her, she'd probably not be in half the trouble she got into. At times I wanted to scream at Fiona to tell those around her to just sit down and shut up, already, so they could hear her side of the story before they judged her. But if she did that, we wouldn't have a story, now would we? At any rate, I found this book enjoyable, but somewhat frustrating, as I figured out before I had gotten past the dust jacket one of the big secrets of the novel, and the other secrets became just about as obvious as the novel went on. Still, this novel teaches its readers a very important lesson, one that hit home with me, anyway -- peace at any price is not worth it."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I admit I did not get into this story right away. However, when it begins to take off, BOY does it ever! Fiona Range is a novel full of twists and turns, and even though I thought most of it was predictable, the ending threw me for a loop.Fiona Range is probably the oldest teenager alive -- 30-years-old and still causing trouble. Raised by her aunt and uncle after the hasty disappearance of her mother shortly after her birth, Fiona has always felt like an outsider. Growing up in a house full of cousins who could do no wrong, Fiona looks at herself as the Black Sheep, the Trouble Maker, the Embarrassment Who Can't Get Her Life Straight. Slipping in and out of different beds quicker than changing socks, and if there is a moment of goodness that lasts longer than usual, leave it to Fiona to break the monotony.Fiona's story is one of sadness and trying to fit in. It speaks of the different relationships that surround her: with her family, who tend to cover their own transgressions with surface smiles and false happiness; with her ex-boyfriend, Todd, who is a troublemaker in his own right; her co-workers at the diner, Maxine, Chester, Donna and Sandy, who have their own stories to share; and her father, Patrick, who Fiona seeks out for answers about her mother. The fun begins at an engagement party for Fiona's cousin, Elizabeth, and doesn't end until novel's close. Excellent writing, very engrossing storytelling. Will be reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Where do I start? At the beginning of course.

I feel like a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; just watching all these people's relationships and interactions and decisions. With a house/husband/kids/p/t job, Ms. Morris is the only author that completely absorbs my thoughts and takes me away into another realistic world. I'm a die-hard Oprah book club fan, and Morris' books exemplifies all the relationship intricacies. Her characters are always 3-dimensional, never just &quot;cliche&quot; people. She's not a &quot;happily ever after&quot; author, which is also realistic. If anyone else out there also loves Mary McGarry Morris' books as much as I do (I read them all), please e-mail me to give me other books similar to hers, that are just as absorbing and realistic. I'm a avid reader and would love to share book info. Thanks. Enjoy Fiona!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Once I picked FIONA up I couldn't put her down. I suspect that's how a lot of the other men whom she encountered in her life felt too. FIONA is voracious and demanding and very pleasing as well. Bet you can't tell if I mean the heroine or the book itself. You've got to get this one and find out. I can't get FIONA out of my head. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I found this book SO exasperating. Fiona is totally unsympathetic. Within a single paragraph, she thinks she's being dismissed by her family, then she likes them, then her feelings are hurt by some perceived slight, and on and on it goes. I thought it was carelessly written; it felt very lazy to me - it could have done with serious editing. Plus, I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was set in the 40s or 50s, which is fine, if the book REALLY were set in those decades; I had to keep reminding myself this was supposedly set in the current day. I finished the book because I just had to see if it was going to be ludicrous to the very end, and it was. Even the &quot;happy ending&quot; was apathetic and tacked-on.I've liked the author's other books, so I was most disappointed when I finally got my hands on this one. I did finish it, but I sure won't be passing it on to my friends!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I'm one of those people who dislikes re-reading books, or seeing a movie more than once. I'm a novelist myself (unpublished, but hopeful), and I like to gulp as much fiction and media as I can, but rarely go back over old ground.The only movie I watch over and over is the Coen Brothers' \\"Miller's Crossing\\" and the only books I seem able to re-read are those by Mary McGarry Morris.For one thing, each time I re-visit one of her novels, I find there are new layers of meaning I missed the first, and even the second time. For example, the first time I read Fiona Range, I, like some of the others who have reviewed it here, found it to be less tragic and moving than her other books, \\"A Dangerous Woman,\\" \\"Vanished\\" (my favorite; it should have won the Pulitzer) and \\"Songs In Ordinary Time.\\"However, I am currently re-reading it now and, contrary to what I thought was going to happen (I knew the ending, so how could it be surprising and interesting?) it has turned out to be even better BECAUSE I know the ending. Now it truly does seem tragic, a magnificent character study of a Woman Interrupted...a woman whose whole life revolves around the black hole of lost identity, a giant lie perpetuated by those who pretend to have cared for her.It's a about monstrous hypocrisy and what happens to people when they are kept from essential knowledge about themselves. It's about cruelty that drives people to self-destruct. Damn, it's good.After Faulkner and Joyce, Mary McGarry Morris has had the most significant effect on my writing. Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Ford, Russell Barnes (\\"Affliction\\"), Alice McDermott, Annie Prioux, Stephen King, Toni Morrison...they are all to be studied, and I owe them so much. But Mary is the greatest writer in America today. As another reviewer here noted, her characters are fresh, real, surprising, devoid of stereotype, human to the bone. No one writes them living and breathing as she does.With their many flaws and their heartaches, their jerkiness, their addictions, their violence and their cuteness, they are truly unforgettable. The old expression, \\"To know her, is to love her,\\" is what makes these books keepers. Thanks, Mary, for the gifts."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Mary McGarry Morris has a winner on her hands. This book is just wonderful. I think it could possibly be one of the best books I have read this summer (and, I've read a lot) but, this one has everything you need. The characters, story, plot, setting, etc...I found it thrilling, charming and wonderfully told. Others have said it's no better than a cheap &quot;dime-store&quot; romance novel, but I disagree. I thought it was well written and very nicely told. It's a smart book by a gifted author. Certainly one I would recommend to others."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Fiona Range is a revealing book about a young woman who learns to take her place in the world, in spite of her step-family's well-meaning attempts to keep her an outsider. Fiona is raised by her maternal aunt and uncle and grows up with three cousins, one of whom is also her best friend. While Fiona is attractive and witty, she's also a hellion facing a turning point in her life. She is searching for the reasons why she is such a difficult person, and why she is so unappreciative of her step-family's 'good deeds'. Fiona's life changes when she digs up the family secrets and asks to have the record set straight.Fiona Range is a great study of the kinds of people who take in 'abandoned' children and undermine those children's fragile sense of security by 'unintentionally' reminding them of their second-class status. It is also a great study of the development of the classic 'guarded personality'.Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Whisked through 418 pages in two-days. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I really hoped to enjoy this book. The initial introduction to Fiona, is risque, yet pathetic. She wakes up one morning to find herself in bed, hungover from a party the evening before, with an aquaintence, whose wife was in the hospital, recovering from childbirth.And it only gets worse from there..All the male charecters are seen as Fionas' victims. From her employer to her family, they all complain of being victims to her selfishness. I couldnt sympathize at all with her.Her worst charecter in this book is the cruel and crazy Patrick Grady, who is believed to be Fiona's illigitamate father. She relentlessly persues a relationship with this terrible man because she wants to be his daughter. The author paints a one sided picture of him...never really showing any warmth or humane personality traits. It made Fiona seem even more unreal, to chase after him so relentlessly.The other charecter who was so irritating was her cousin Elizabeth. She is whiny, spineless and weak. I had wondered how she attracted so much love and attention from the other people in this book.I have to say the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a 4 hour bus trip, and it was more interesting then the scenery.On a more positive note, this book was mildly entertaining, and an easy read. It seemed like more of a soap opera plot then a book with a lot of substance, which can sometimes be fun."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Although Fiona Range, the title character of her fourth book is the main focus of this story, author Mary McGarry Morris ultimately paints the portrait of a flawed family trying to maintain its place in a very confusing and complex world. Fiona Range is a satisfying, if not always easy look into the world of a prominent New England family and its one wild child. When she is quite young, Fiona is abandoned by her mother; she is denied paternity by her father, Patrick Grady; she is raised by relatives who do not understand her petulant behavior and who are constantly puzzled by her absolute lack of judgment. Fiona is 30. For the past few years, she has worked as a waitress in Chester's Coffee Shop in Dearborn, Massachusetts. Her life is stuck in a constant cycle of rebellion, failed relationships, and an endless, empty horizon. As much as she yearns to be part of the family who raised her, she is repulsed by their shallow lives and their almost insatiable need to present a perfect face to the community. Her Uncle Charles Grady is a prominent judge. Her Aunt Arlene is the perfect wife and mother, volunteering in the community and taking care of those who cannot take care of themselves. To the world, the Grady family is a model of success. Their three children are educated, employed and functioning members of society. Jack is a computer whiz. Ginny runs a day care. Elizabeth, the schoolteacher, is engaged to a wonderful doctor from New York. Their lives are picture perfect, if you don't look too close. And then there's Fiona. The trouble with you, Fiona, is you don't think before you act. The trouble with you, Fiona, is you don't think. The trouble with you, Fiona, is you. The trouble with Fiona is you. The trouble. Fiona is the trouble. There are a lot of issues raised in this book. Not all of them are resolved, but they're out there for the reader's inspection. This is not a book you read in one night. You must pace yourself in order to endure Fiona's wild abandon, Elizabeth's neuroses, Patrick Grady's madness, and ultimately, the Grady family's undoing. I liked all the characters in this book. No one was perfect and there were no Hollywood endings, all neatly tied up with red ribbons. The people who make this story work are flawed and they all struggle with life's hardest questions. In other words, these people could be REAL. And, to me, that's what quality fiction should create: real people, flaws and all, dealing with life's triumphs and tragedies, while trying to make their way in the world without inflicting too much damage on themselves and those around them. Very Highly Recommended.Terry H. Mathews Reviewer"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I found myself desperately trying to get to like the character of Fiona, and just when I thought I could, she would do something to upset me. In this respect, I found the character very well written, because despite the fact she isn't always likeable, this is who she is. What was so disappointing was the extremely predictable ending, as well as the lack of well developed characters other than Fiona. I still find the book a decent read, just not one of the best."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I have never written a review - good or bad, but felt compelled to do so. I have never rolled my eyes or made exclamations of disgust (at the writing, not Fiona) quite so many times. I am not a snob, but I do have high standards, and I believe the author wrote &quot;down&quot; to us . . . nowadays, the reading population is fairly sophisticated. I found many editing mistakes and was surprised that Viking had published it. There were too many contractions - speaks to the entire book being poorly written. Ms. Morris - I challenge you to rise above mediocrity.And . . . .why does this all suddenly happen in Fiona's 30th year . . . what on earth has she been doing for the past 12 years since HS graduation? She is shallow, petty and childish, and not a character I care to read about. The foreshadowing was incredible, I figured out the &quot;plot twists&quot; about a third of the way through. I am honestly surprised so many readers enjoyed it, but I doubt if my views in the minority.

Fiona, who could have been an interesting character, comes off more annoying than sympathetic. As I read it, I wondered if this might be one of the author's earlier efforts, which is being published now that she has achieved some success.

I read Morris's Oprah-chosen novel and liked it well enough to pick up her new one. This is a let-down! All of the characters are predictable and one-dimensional. There is not a sympathetic one in the bunch. Elizabeth, George, and Rudy all come across as spineless. Fiona herself, if she was really that headstrong, would have left these people behind a long time ago.

The story line was transparent - there were no surprises whatsoever. I had it all figured out about 1/3 of the way through and just slogged through the repetition and confusion so I could see if it got any better.

There are so many typos that it is distracting to someone who knows how to use grammar. Tbe plot is too simplisitic for a book this long--maybe better suited to a novella or a short-story.

Thirty years ago her irresponsible unwed mother abandoned Fiona as an infant. In Dearborn, Massachusetts, her conservative aunt and uncle raised Fiona to behave properly.Fiona's love life is one disaster after another as she always ends up with a loser. When her \\"perfect\\" cousin Elizabeth, accompanied by her fianc&eacute; arrives in town, Fiona, acting par for the course, ends up sleeping with the fianc&eacute; and her cousin's former local boy friend. Her efforts to get closer to Patrick Grady, rumored to be her father, flops even worse although Fiona defies her uncle's warning about this person he gives hush money to keep quiet. Fiona knows she needs to reclaim her life, but each step she takes is closer to the abyss.FIONA RANGE is an exciting psychological character study that will remind readers of LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR. The cast is clearly defined, which enables the audience to fully understand the conflicting emotions that eat away at Fiona's self respect. The story line is filled with tension that builds up to a fine climax as readers wonder what will Fiona do next to cause herself even deeper hurt. However, at the same time, the constant repetitiveness of Fiona's self destruction costs her any empathy. Though superbly drawn, part of the story line feels like filler. Still, Mary McGarry Morris packs quite an emotional wallop in a story that goes deep into the inner gut of a person knowingly traveling down a path that can only end in tragedy. Fans of relationship dramas will relish this distressing, well-written tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I really only checked in at this site to comment on Mary's Absolut short story on the inside cover of the 5/22 New Yorker.

Quite a feat with a job and 2 young kids, but I MADE time for it. I really felt for all the characters and the ending was great. One part of the ending I was sure of from early on but there were other elements that were a complete surprise. I think every family has a Fiona somewhere in it and this was a great insight into what they (the Fionas) are going through.

She had been very drunk the night before and can't remember what happened. As she sees this man leave her apartment, she realizes it is the husband of one of her friends - a friend who just had a baby yesterday. Fiona just can't seem to get her life straight. She is desperately lonely and doesn't know how to fit in.She was raised by an aunt and uncle. Her mother deserted her when she was an infant and Fiona has always felt like an outsider in her adopted family. They avoid discord at all costs and Fiona is direct, often to the point of her own embarrassment. She is impulsive and doesn't always think before she speaks. She is especially close to her cousin Lizzie who is now engaged to marry a doctor after returning to her family home in Dearborn, Massachusetts. Fiona works as a waitress while all her cousins have careers after attending college. College just wasn't in the books for Fiona. She tried community college but it just didn't work out. Fiona goes through men fast and is considered 'easy'. She tries to make something of her life but as she says, \\"I'm at the wrong place at the right time' or \\"I'm in the right place at the wrong time\\".Fiona is obsessed with knowing more about her mother and finding out who her biological father is. She thinks her biological father is a man names Patrick, a Vietnam War vet who is very unstable and dangerous. She is warned to stay away from him by her employer and her family but she can't. This results in disaster and tragedy for Fiona. Patrick is labile, mercurial and dangerous. Fiona thinks he deserves a chance because she believes he is her father - Patrick and her mother dated throughout high school and were together after he returned from the war.Fiona begins to date Lizzie's ex-boyfriend from high school, George, but this doesn't work out. She finds herself becoming more and more attracted to Lizzie's fiance, Rudy. Lizzie herself can't decide what or who she wants - George or Rudy. Lizzie goes into a deep depression and is very fragile.Fiona's family bails her out of one mistake after another. They say to her, \\"Be like us. Don't keep wasting your life on messes\\". Fiona doesn't want to be like them. They don't talk about things and pretend everything is alright even when things are horrific. There are secrets and lies going on and Fiona is usually the only one of them to address these. Because she addresses what they want to be left unsaid, she is singled out as being the 'wrong' one, the one who just won'd fit into their idea of how a person should act.The story is beautifully written and the prose is superb. My one disappointment with the book is LIzzie's continued relationship with Patrick despite her knowing his true nature. It just doesn't ring true. Even as self-defeating as Fiona is, no one should be able to put up with all that she does with this frightening man. His relationship to her is sick and portends of worse things to come.I am a huge fan of Mary McGarry Morris and I loved this book. I have only one of her books left to read,A Hole in the Universe. I am saving this novel to savor. She is the author ofSongs in Ordinary Time (Oprah's Book Club)andA Dangerous Woman. Most of her books, Fiona Range included, have protagonists that are hard to like. Many are repulsive and outcasts. Yet she brings them into your heart and makes them real and broken so that you can empathize even with their frightening and often despicable natures. She is a remarkable author."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"You can almost see MMM trying to bring out the characters, to shed some sort of three-dimensional light on them, as well as giving some meaning to their interactions. There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying. This could have been a very insightful book, instead, it reads like a soap opera. I hate soap operas."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Oh Dear. This book is absolutely dreadful. There's not a single likable character in it including Fiona who has singlehandedly created a whole new personality disorder for psychiatrists to examine. Elizabeth is so pathetic you want to stuff her in a gunny sack and drown her just to put her (and you) out of your shared misery. All the men are weak, silly characters who fall in and out of love at the author's convenience. There are a host of characters who, at no peril to the 'plot line', would be left out of the Lifetime movie versionto keep the budget down--a tactic that could have been used by the publisher instead of refusing to hire a proof-reader to go over the galleys (the paperback is laden with typos).At the conclusion of 'Fiona Range' the reader is left with the hope that, if biological warfare ever reaches our shores, it will begin and end in Dearborn, Massachusetts. (With apologies to real live residents of Dearborn--if there is such a place. I am quite sure no real town could be inhabited by characters as thoroughly awful as Fiona Range and her gang of idiots and snivelers)."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After reading this book, it is hard to understand how it received so many off color reviews. This book was amazing and nearly impossible to put down. Fiona was such a compelling and real character -- she said the things we all sometimes want to say, but cannot. True, she made many mistakes, with 20-20 hindsight, but this was a character who had been rejected, lied to, used and abused for most of her life. This book would make a great movie. It is about someone who never gives up, even if everyone else seems to have never believed in her. I wish there were more books like this out there -- With the happy ending."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Got it at the airport and the next thing I knew I was in San Francisco. My biggest dream would be to meet Fiona. My biggest nightmare would be to meet Fiona. Morris nails this characterization with her usual stunning perception.

Now if I can just get this maddening, seductive, selfish, brilliant, naive,needy woman off my mind..."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Compared to &quot;Songs in Ordinary Time&quot; this book was boring and predictable. The characters never displayed any depth. I thought it was absurd the way 30 year old Fiona kept dismissing Patrick's inappropriate behaviour. I figured out the plot early on. Maybe the author will do better next time. I'll wait for the paperback on that one!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I am always on the lookout for stong female characters, Fiona has proved to be the weakest yet. With her life revolving around one man to the next, she never takes the time to evaluate her own NEGATIVE choices and take stock in her own worth as a human being. I kept reading simply for this hope, but it never arrived. In the end, Fiona still takes pleasure out of seeing other lives destroyed. Only skillful writing could have saved this character, and unfortunately Morris has failed. Fiona's story is thinly constructed. Morris's novel is devoid of any quality literary technique. And I certainly hope that the copy editors of Viking have been retrained, as misspelled words and punctation errors further scar this already poorly written novel. May I never fall in the type of love that The Philidephia Inquirer calls Morris &quot;a master at depicting.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Ms. McGarry Morris: My clock is ticking.

There is no obvious line of demarcation between good and bad in this book. It's just not that simple.Morris has created a family with such complex and compelling characters that -- gosh -- they could be real.I'll be recommending this story to my reading buddies. It's that good.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I used to be one of those readers who had to finish a book I had started, whether or not it was holding my interest. I am not capable of this these days. I'm sorry to say that I quit reading Fiona Range with less than 100 pages to go, choosing instead to skim the remainder just to find out what happened.Mary McGarry Morris paints the picture of a 30-year-old waitress struggling to make something of her life, while repeatedly getting in her own way. Fiona's mother ran off when Fiona was still a little girl, leaving her to the care of her aunt and uncle, who raised her alongside their own children. Her father is assumed to be Patrick Grady, the violently angry loner who had loved Fiona's mother before he was shipped off to the Vietnam War, but who had returned a scarred and changed man who still denies any relationship to Fiona. When we first meet our heroine, she is dealing with a rat's nest of problems, including strained relationships with her aunt and uncle and her bizarre, persistent attempts to build a relationship with Patrick. Her biggest problems, however, seem to revolve around her cousin Elizabeth and Elizabeth's fiance, Rudy. Elizabeth doesn't seem to want to marry Rudy, but also can't let him go... which eventually pushes him toward Fiona, causing repercussions in every aspect of Fiona's messy life.Sound interesting? It was, until about halfway, when all of the characters began to grate on my nerves. Fiona herself is hard to pin down- she does or says something horrible, then goes for long stretches of time acting pretty much like a normal human being, before doing something bad again. I couldn't decide if I liked her or found her irritating. The other characters, on the other hand, are so one-dimensional and repetitive that it's painful. In particular, I grew so weary of Elizabeth's hand-wringing and spinelessness that I felt no sympathy for her when her difficulty in breaking things off with Rudy pushed her closer and closer to emotional collapse. Throw in a few too many hushed conversations, family secrets that are constantly danced around (even long after the reader has guessed the truth), and angry phone conversations, and you have a book that eventually becomes unreadable.I give &quot;Fiona Range&quot; three stars, because it could have been much worse. However, if you are new to this author, I would recommend &quot;Songs in Ordinary Time&quot; or &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; before I would suggest this novel."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"You want to care about Fiona, you really do. She has it rough, trouble just seems to float in her tepid cup of yesterday's bitter coffee. But unfortunately this book reads like a mediocre second hand account of someone's sister. Interesting, especially at first, but things start to drag, times rolls on, you finally reach the big, final conflict and you swear to yourself you're watching an episode of General Hospital. (Not that there's anything wrong with General Hospital, but you expect something different from Morris.) Such promise, such a beautiful cover, but I found myself shrugging afterwards, and moving on."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I was so drawn into Mary McGarry Morris' book Songs In Ordinary Time. I hovered in that world created by such an expert of nuance and detail. I loathed the story of Fiona Range. I can't believe this came from Mary's hand. I can't believe this was written after Songs In Ordinary Time. I would guess this to be more of a first try than a novel by such a successful author. This story was unbalanced, inconsistent, dull. I told the library that they should lose it instead of returning it to the shelf. I was so disappointed!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Good opening chapter that soon fell prey to redundant explanations of Fiona's emotions through tired cliches. The attempts at suspense were just annoying because Fiona neglected to ask the right questions, and then the suspense gave way to a predictable ending. I think the story was valid, and worthy of being told, in half as much space."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I am not a snob, but I do have high standards, and I believe the author wrote &quot;down&quot; to us . . . nowadays, the population is fairly sophisticated. I found many editing mistakes and was surprised that Viking/Penguin had published it. There were too many contractions - speaks to the entire book being poorly written. Ms. Morris - I challenge you to rise above mediocrity.Why does this all of a sudden happen in Fiona's 30th year . . . what on earth has she been doing for the past 12 years since HS graduation? She is shallow, petty and childish, and not a character I care to read about.Less than halfway into the book, I figured out the ending . . . so much for plot twists. There's an incredible amount of foreshadowing.I am honestly surprised so many readers enjoyed it, but I doubt if my views are in the minority. However, since it was an Oprah book, my hopes may have been too high."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I have to say this is the best book I've read this year. The main character, Fiona, is constructed so well that you feel as if you know her and her family because the detail given is so in depth.Upon reading the first chapter, I had to find out what was going to happen to Fiona. I hungered to know whether her life would ever be settled. Fiona you see, is a 30yr old waitress who is known as the town trouble maker. But reading this novel from her perspective you see what a kind-hearted person she really is and you will root for her. Although she sometimes does questionable things and the reader knows what Fiona is doing is wrong, you can't help but pray that things turn out for her.I really, really enjoyed this novel and plan to recommend it to all of my friends. The brilliant writing will keep you hooked!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After I read Songs in Ordinary Time, I was hooked and searched for all of M.M.M's books. I LOVED her earlier books. I was a tiny bit disappointed in Fiona. I found myself becoming tired of her continual &quot;bad luck.&quot; Her earlier books were more meaty and real. Good but no cigars."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Finally done with this book! Fiona Range is by far the worst book I've read by Morris. It was near torturous trying to finish this novel with its multitude of typos and grammatical errors. Whoever attempted to proof/edit this novel should be fired. I found the story boring and the characters lifeless. I couldn't wait for Fiona to slice her wrist or do something equally stupid given that her sole talent in this novel seems to be her ability to make one stupid decision after the other. The book's ending did not surprise me; I'd predicted it before halfway finishing the book. If you're interested in truly experiencing this author's talent read Vanished or Songs in Ordinary Time."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I just loved the character, Fiona. She was tough yet soft.

It is also excellent."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"MMM is a good writer (especially A Dangerous Woman), but this book is flat.Fiona is unsympathetic. She is a 30 year old brat. Her feeling of being an outsider is self-induced, and the constant episodes where she is \\"acting out\\" are repetitive and exasperating. The other main characters are equally repellant.The book suffers from sloppy editing, as well.No one hits a home run with every book, but this one doesn't even make it to first base."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Thirty-year-old Fiona Range, the hapless heroine of this book, is a self described &quot;magnet for trouble&quot;. Fiona's life reads like a 90s version of a Greek tragedy. Abandoned by her mother at infancy, she is raised by her genteel and conventional uncle and aunt - the Hollises - in a small town near Boston. Desperate for attention and a sense of belonging, the volatile Fiona careens from one feckless man to another, barely holding down a waitressing job. In her saner moments, she wallows in guilt, wishing she &quot;could get on with her life instead of feeling so hopelessly stalled all the time&quot;.The novel begins with Fiona waking up in bed with the husband of a close friend, after a drunken party. Things only get messier. After being virtually shunned by her foster family for her reckless behaviour, Fiona decides to seek out Patrick Grady, the troubled and violent town loner rumoured to be her father. Despite the warnings of the Hollises, she relentlessly badgers Grady to let her into his life and tell her more about her mother. Grady initially rejects her, then becomes possessive and threatening. Meanwhile, the Hollis family prepares for the much anticipated wedding of Fiona's dutiful but indecisive cousin Elizabeth. As Elizabeth vacillates between her old flame George Grimshaw and her new fiance Rudy Larkin, Fiona ends up drifting inexplicably into liaisons with both men. Eventually the story hurtles to a violent and sensational denouement, as the Hollis family secrets are exposed.Morris's three previous novels have won rave reviews. Her first novel, Vanished, was nominated for the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner award. Her third, Songs In Ordinary Time, became a bestseller after being chosen by Oprah Winfrey for her book club. Morris certainly has a knack for realistic, crisp dialogue. Fiona's &quot;wicked mouth&quot; and endearing habit of talking first and thinking later will have many a reader rooting for her. &quot;You are too true to be good,&quot; says Rudy to Fiona at one stage, and it is Fiona's blunt charm that propels the narrative forward. The book's best passages are those where Fiona ticks off the repressed Hollises. But as the novel meanders on, and Fiona flounders ever deeper in messes of her own making, readers may find themselves more exasperated than empathetic.Her perpetual regrets over wasted opportunities come close to whining, and the novel becomes bogged down by Fiona's dreary wrangles with a stream of deceitful, unsuitable or brutal men. Morris's farfetched soap-opera plot, with its untimely deaths and dark secrets, strains credibility, before a climax so predicable that only Fiona fails to see it coming. Fiona Range is as wayward and confused as Fiona."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Mary McGarry Morris evinces striking skill at creating the vivid character of Fiona Range. Fiona is hard to admire, but engages interest by her rebel attitude and behavior. She is someone the apparently respectable people of small town Dearborn near Boston, shun and label as trouble.Some of her bad behavior is not exactly of her making. By book's end, readers gain some sympathy for her.She steps into the book in the worst light. From a drunken state where she is beyond knowing what she is doing, she wakens hungover in her own bed -- but with a hairy arm wrapped around her that could belong to any male from this small depressing town. Although she never misses a day, she is late for work, as a waitress in Chester and Maxine's coffee shop. Thirty-year-old Fiona arrives with a throbbing temple, her hair looking possibly as though cut, dried and fried, her good looks on vacation.Maxine is Chester's wife, her attempts at waitressing are hilarious. She would make Guinness Book of Records for average number of plates dropped per shift.Life for Fiona sinks further until she determines to restore it. It would help if she could identify her father.Many point to Patrick Grady, a local dysfunctional war veteran. She harasses him but he refuses to talk to her. Her mother disappeared years ago. Brought up by a family presided over by Judge Hollis, Fiona became persona non grata because of bad behavior, and they evicted her.Fiona likes to speak truth. It is not always what people want to hear, gossip is more their style. Small communities have a reputation of everyone knowing everyone else's business. Like Peyton Place, Dearborn also houses dangerous secrets.These explode in final chapters that solve a long standing mysterious disappearance and create an exciting and surprising denouement for all that has occurred."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I just finished reading Fiona Range & had to write this review. I read 150 pages in one sitting--which says a lot about a book. I have to say that when I got this book, I was enticed by the title because I like the name Fiona. When I first started reading it, I saw Fiona, the main character, as pretty much a slut & someone I wouldn't like if I ever met her.Fiona Range became really good & you saw that Fiona was more than just a slut. I could relate to her struggles of trying to fit into her conformed life with her aunt & uncle. She struggled to grow close to who she thought was her father & deal with the fact that she was 30 & had become nothing & constantly made mistakes. This novel had a very surprise ending & I really thought it was creative & well written.

I got more excitment when Billy Ray Tuggle and Opal were introduced years ago on &quot;All my Children&quot;. At least they could act. Fiona was a whiney woman who just made me sick instead of sorry for her. Her cousin was a poor excuse for a human being constantly crying and acting like a two-year old. I felt like I was reading a book about two woman who where psychiatric cases. That premise would have been interesting if I actually had any feeling for these characters. The only person I had any interest in was Fiona's father. He was an interesting character study.

I really enjoyed the characters and all the little (and big) messes Fiona gets herself and her family into.

But my recommendations of it are based upon its sensible content. Here is my take on how the Enterprise Unified Process can improve your organization.Enterprise thinking is not about thinking \\"bigger\\", it's about thinking differently. The Enterprise Unified Process is a qualitative leap forward that will change the scope of your project from simply a development lifecycle to a SYSTEM lifecycle. The authors aptly recommend that if you are not yet using an iterative process, then you should first adopt the Rational UP, Scrum, FDD or other project-focused development process. But if your needs go beyond merely managing or executing development projects, you will need to move to the EUP.Structurally, the EUP builds on the RUP, and augments RUP to address the needs of an enterprise rather than just software development. Structurally, the EUP adds two new phases to RUP: the Production phase and the Retirement Phase. The Production phase begins after RUP's Transition phase, and this is where each release of software spends its entire life after it is developed. The activities of the Production phase focus on keeping your software and systems running, backed-up, and that defect reports are being addressed. The Retirement phase defines the activities involved in removing software, or a system, from production. Retirement is a complex process that can be accomplished all-at-once, or incrementally over time, but retirement always requires coordination with other processes in your organization.EUP adds a new support Discipline to RUP: the Operations and Support Discipline. This discipline includes disaster planning and recovery, service-level agreements between operations and support teams, and addressing end-user questions and problem reports for systems in production.But EUP goes far beyond vanilla RUP with the addition of \\"Enterprise Management Disciplines\\" that are specific and unique to the enterprise context. Here, EUP introduces the disciplines and associated roles and activities for:* Enterprise Business Modeling* Portfolio Managment* Enterprise Architecture* Strategic Reuse* People Management* Enterprise Administration* Software Process ImprovementEach discipline is explained clearly with discussion of the workflows that are executed, sample case studies, tools that can assist you in the discipline, and--my favorite--\\"anti-patterns\\" for each discipline. For me the anti-patterns helped me to better understand each discipline's goals.If you are familiar with RUP, you should have a feeling now for how much RUP does not address for the enterprise, and how much the EUP has to offer. But how can an organization move to EUP? Luckily, the authors conclude the book with sound recommendations on adopting the EUP. If you are involved with, or responsible for, software development to support your company's business goals, this book will help you understand the many dimensions that RUP does not begin to address."},{"Title":"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process","review":"Scott Ambler and the crew at Ronin have helped define the nature of Agile development (see www.agilemodeling.com) and that is the task set here : make RUP, a very structured IT development process more agile and flexible. But also along the way, Scott and crew also help to make it more complete - they bring the single process up into a larger framework of an organizational viewpoint. This is aided by extending the Zachman framework slightly plus adding three key components to the RUP development cycle.First, the the RUP Transition is expanded into Transition, Production and Retirement. By explicitly bringing a complete cycle view of development key IT asset issues are addressed which otherwise might be omitted. Ditto for adding Strategic Reuse and Software Process Improvement - these are tough issues to handle. For example, many eXtreme Programming adherents are dead set against any amounts of time spent on Reuse and Strategic Improvements; but Scott and company set some disciplined guidelines for both processes.But the most important contribution of the book is to set reasonable goals for modeling and planning- in effect, EUP strives to make these activities deliver clear benefits measured better team communications, consensus building and measurable targets and process goals. Agile uses models as tests of design.So what is missing, since we rated this 4 on 5. First, although the book does treat risk management it does not use it as a guide to process effectiveness - those models and plans and every step of the EUP process better help reduce the risks of a project or one of its phases going awry or they have failed to deliver. See Boehm and Turner's Balancing Agility and Discipline for the risk based approach to project management. Second, SOA-Service Oriented Architectures and Web Services are changing the nature of development profoundly because they up the value of workflow and integration between systems (long neglected in IT projects). As noted EUP catches some of this but unfortunately does not look at the specific ramifications.But overall this book is conundrum challenging - its a disciplined and fruitful look at making a structured planning process more agile."},{"Title":"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process","review":"The Enterprise Unified Process (EUP) unites diverse disciplines, including development, enterprise architecture, operations, production and portfolio management, reuse and business process modeling, under an easy to follow framework. It was refreshing to find a book that recognizes the need to accommodate the installed base of existing software as part of the planning, development and deployment process. This is an excellent guide for any manager who wants to ensure that essential IT disciplines are addressed.The focus of EUP is to enhance the commonly accepted Rational Unified Process (RUP). The authors have added new disciplines to RUP that include business modeling, portfolio management, enterprise administration, reuse, enterprise architecture and process improvement. The introduction of business modeling into the overall process is essential to weave IT processes and disciplines into the most essential driver of any systems initiative - the business. The enterprise architecture discussion was also refreshing given that many organizations have forgone this discipline and have created redundant, stovepipe applications and data structures that significantly stifle business agility.The \\"Reuse\\" chapter raises the rarely deployed reuse strategy. It is critically important to not replicate business processes, models, systems, data structures, source code and interfaces. The costs and risks of trying to keep parallel assets synchronized have been written about extensively. This book promotes the idea that reuse is just another aspect of the enterprise unified process. It is also one of the few discussions about reuse that recognizes the value of harvesting existing assets.Also of note is the portfolio management discussion that focuses attention on the need to incorporate project management with application management. It should be noted, however, that portfolio management has much less focus on applications than the traditional industry definition as promoted by Gartner, Inc.Finally, this book makes great use of tips, tool references and citations to books or papers that readers can use to expand on their understanding of a given topic.

The systematic and disciplined treatment is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of much useful, pragmatic advice that draws from the practical experience of the authors in building real systems.I quite liked this book.

It does a great job at filling in many of the gaps in RUP. The Life of a software system is so much more than just the development cycle. Unfortunately, so much \\"process\\" stuff these days focuses on developing the software without regard to some very important facts. For instance, IF the development and installation processes are successful (and we hope they will be) then someone will need to maintain the system.EUP thoughtfully guides us through supporting that system while in production and then eventually retiring such a system."},{"Title":"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process","review":"In their book, \\"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process\\", Scott Ambler, John Nalbone, and Michael Vizdos boldly lead the reader out of the myopia of RUP's single project focus into the light of enterprise-wide IT disciplines and processes.This book provides proven approaches to the enterprise-wide challenges inherent to developing, maintaining, and operating complex IT environments and projects. Enterprise Architects will want to pay particular attention to the chapter, \\"The Enterprise Administration Discipline\\" when working with ITSM groups utilizing ITIL Version 3. This chapter facilitates communication and collaboration between Enterprise Architecture teams and IT Service Management teams. Professionals on IT projects who are unfamiliar with the nature and purpose of Enterprise Architecture will want to particular attention to the chapter, \\"The Enterprise Architecture Discipline\\". This chapter defines the Enterprise Architecture function, and shows why it lies beyond the bounds of a single project; a common misunderstanding for RUP practitioners.__Joseph Starwood ([...])"},{"Title":"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process","review":"If you are using the Rational Unified Process, or considering doing so, and worried about applying it to a whole IT department rather than separate projects then this book could well be useful. The book has four parts - From RUP to EUP, Beyond Development, Enterprise Management Disciplines and Putting it all Together. Each section has several chapters and the chapters all start with a nice reader ROI section (showing the payoff for reading that chapter). The writing is clear and there are plenty of diagrams, tables and helpful tips.The book starts of with some background in the RUP. I particularly liked the description of RUP as serial in the large and iterative in the small. Within the RUP there are also nine disciplines (Business Modeling, Requirements, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Test, Deployment, Configuration and Change Management, Project Management, and Environment). The authors outline 10 best practices they see as core to the EUP (they extend the original 6 in RUP) - Develop iteratively, Manage requirements, Proven architecture, Modeling, Continuously verify quality, Manage change, Collaborative development, Look beyond deployment, Deliver working software regularly and Manage risk. Each is clearly described.In addition to the change best practices, EUP adds a Production phase and a Retirement phase. They point out that the Production phase is not just maintenance or just operations and support but both and more. I think that any organization building systems should spend as much time and effort thinking about production and running their application in production (which includes maintaining it over time) as they do in building it and I was glad to see this so strongly proposed. They also added an operations and support discipline, mostly but not entirely in the production phase. This discipline includes running the system and making hot fixes. I think the Retirement phase is overkill for most organizations but some will find it useful.They also added some \\"Enterprise Management\\" disciplines for use outside the context of a project and this too is a good idea. The disciplines are Enterprise business modeling, Enterprise Portfolio Management, Enterprise Architecture (I particularly liked the idea that \\"modifiability\\" should be considered as part of an enterprise architecture - far too few organizations do this well and fail to differentiate between stable services and much more changeable ones), Strategic Reuse (Again I liked the called-out focus on this - without a real plan no reuse is going to happen), People management , Enterprise Administration and Software Process Improvement (Another good one and a timely reminder to all that you should keep improving your software processes)Overall I liked the book, though it was a somewhat dry subject (as methodologies often are). There was a lot of good advice, some nice tips and some clearly hard-won experience being shared!"},{"Title":"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process","review":"Many IT organizations still pursue pet projects and develop duplicate applications in isolation, only to address later crises in corporate reporting, portfolio management, IT infrastructure, business objectives, and other areas.EUP gives a coherent roadmap of how to architect smarter and for the long term.

The problems with RMI are firstly that the learning curve about remote object technology has not been made simpler by the introduction of RMI by SUN, which is understandable. Secondly RMI itself has been very poorly documented from the outset and up to this point nothing had changed in this regard. The book java.rmi changes all of this. It is a tour de force. Whether you want to understand network and distributed computing in general, you want to begin writing RMI programs and need clear insights into how best to proceed, or you are very experienced with the technology and you have been getting by these past few years with your grab-bag of work-arounds; for all concerned salvation is at hand. You should get hold of a copy of this book, in a clear and insightful fashion it addresses all of those needs.

This entertaining, vivid and suspenseful novel is a bloody (there is an incredible amount of headcutting in this book) fictional telling of the quite savage \\"wars of peace\\" between the US Army and Filipinos at the turn of the 20th century. In this case it focuses on the deeds of the brutal, brave, skilled but somehow doomed Moros of Sulu Island. The main characters, US Army officer Shay Sullivan, Moro warlord Jokiri, his adopted daughter(?) Medina, and British deserter Dawson are skillfully drawn. Yes, the story can be a bit hackneyed and melodramatic at times but also touching and horrifying. You also learn a fair amount about guerrilla warfare and various nasty Moro edged weapons - the barong, the kampilan and others.

I would say that so far this is my least favorite of the books I have read. I am not saying it is not a good book, it is a really good book. Just compared to her other books, this one is lacking. OK, even though I figured out the \\"who done it\\" in the begining of the book, it still had the suspense factor. I may have known who did it, but at times I still questioned it and did not know what he was going to do. That mixed with the sexual tension keeps your heart pounding through out the whole book. I though that John in this book was a little too um, distant. It seemed he felt nothing but lust. Most male characters usually make some mention of feeling something other then lust, even if they turn right around and tell themselves they are wrong, they at least mention it. I didnt like how up until the very last page, he didnt seem to have deeper feelings. He kept them just a little too hidden. He was an interesting character though. They all are in her books. There were things that were also left to the imagination I guess. Just little things that seemed to be signifigant were never mentioned after the first time. Like the knife. Did it ever have any impact on anything? Or even at the end when she wore the dress,it was so important to her when she was getting dressed, so while we are waiting for his reaction to it, it never happens. Just little stuff like that. I still thought it was a good book, but there were too many little things that were not matching up that took some of the enjoyment out of it for me. But dont knock it until you try it."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Anne Stuart is a great novelist, whether she's writing suspense, historical, or contemporary romance. However, STILL LAKE, while a good book, doesn't in any way compare to what I expect from a writer of Stuart's caliber.The rundown of the plot is that Thomas Griffin was arrested twenty years ago for the murder of his girlfriend--a crime he has no idea whether he committed or not. Finally, in 2002, curiosity gets the better of him and he returns to the scene of the murder, only to spend the majority of his time butting heads (and other things) with his neighbor, Sophie Davis.The main problems with this book is that the suspense is not suspenseful, and the romance is weak at best. These are major flaws in a romantic suspense novel. I guessed who the real murderer was almost immediately--it's blindingly obvious, and one of the biggest disappointments in the book--and the relationship between Thomas and Sophie seems to be based almost entirely on sex and a mutual love of classic cars. While there were some nice moments between them, I wasn't really convinced they were compatible personalities, let alone in love.Overall, STILL LAKE was okay, but the story was incredibly weak. It simply did not grip my interest in the way that THE WIDOW, which was an excellent book, and SHADOWS AT SUNSET, also very good, did. I hope Stuart returns to her usual brilliancy with her next novel."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"I usually like Anne Stuart's books, but there are a few major inconsistencies in STILL LAKE that strongly detract from the conclusion. The story line hinges on one of the characters behaving in a way that is highly unlikely and to put is plainly -stupid. There is also doubt that the villain would be able to behave in the manner described. I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling the book for others. Despite all this, there is nothing special about STILL LAKE. There is little that is original or remarkable. As far as suspense, I had no trouble whatever putting it down and was never caught up in the suspense.Anne Stuart has done much better in the past."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"First, let me say that Anne Stuart has written some of the finest, most unusual romances I've ever had the pleasure of reading. \\"Nightfall\\" and \\"Ritual Sins\\" are my favorites.\\"Still Lake\\" is a sad, limp rehash of \\"Nightfall\\". Her writing is sloppy, too much of the passive voice and too many inconsistencies even in the descriptions of the main characters! For instance, in one paragraph the hero's face is described as being classic and interesting, but not pretty. Yet a few pages later his face is described as \\"too pretty\\" and is compared to that of a Rennaissance angel. Huh?Also, the \\"mystery\\"...Five chapters into the book I knew who the villain was and knew what had happened. It's hard to stay interested with such transparent and shallow characters.I would recommend that you skip this book althogther. And if you haven't read \\"Nightfall\\", snatch that one up instead. The basic premise is the same...man accused of murder...is irresistable man killer or not? etc, etc.One of Ms. Stuart's best qualities as a romance writer was her ability to create very sexy, very dangerous, very ambiguous heros...some on the verge of being anti-hero, with a dark erotic edge. I have missed that quality in her more recent endeavors."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Sophie Davis, according to her sister Marty, is known as the poor woman's Martha Stewart. Taking her skills as a homemaking columnist to a higher level, she's decided to convert an old farm house into a bread and breakfast. Stonegate Farm on Still Lake, in Colby, Vermont is Sophie's choice for her undertaking. Unfortunately, the area has a grisly history. Twenty years before, the murders of three teenaged girls occurred there. But, Sophie's determined, since her new farm will make a good home and project, for herself, her mother Grace, and teenaged sister, Marty.John Smith, alias of Thomas Ingram Griffin, was convicted of the murders of the three girls. On a technicality, he was released from prison just a few years after his incarceration. John decides it is time to find the real murderer of the three girls. Or, did he really do it? He can't remember what happened the night the third girl was killed. As fate would have it, he returns to Colby to rent a cabin neigboring Stonegate farm. And, as fate would have it, Sophie and John will meet.STILL LAKE is a fast-moving read. The descriptions of the beautiful countryside in Vermont, put me there. The relationship between Sophie and John is fascinating. While they appear as opposites at first, I understood their attraction, felt the sexual tension, and enjoyed their lustful, then loving, romance.Secondary characters in STILL LAKE entertain also. Grace seems befuddled, Marty an angst-filled teen, and yet each contributes to the fast-moving pages.While I think most readers would find the villian pretty obvious, I thought the real mystery was how and why the murders happened. Also, feeling the menace that comes from the villian throughout the book, adds to the suspense.STILL LAKE is the kind of book I look for. It's a great story with a sexy romance, and page-turning suspense."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Was he a murderer? That question has haunted Thomas Ingram Griffin for over twenty years. On a summer day in 1982 Griffin woke up at a farm in Colby, Vermont covered in blood and accused of killing his girlfriend as well as two other girls. Convicted for murder but eventually released on a technicality, Griffin went on, in the ultimate irony, to become a successful lawyer. However, the time has come for Griffin to search for the truth. Changing his name and renting a cottage in Colby for the summer, he finds out that the farm where the murders occurred has been transformed into a country inn. Now, Griffin must somehow find a way to search the property for clues to a decades old crime and keep his hands off the delectable innkeeper.Sophie Davis is trying to keep it together. She's burnt her bridges by leaving the city and buying a farmhouse in rural Vermont. Okay, so the property was the scene of a grisly triple murder. A little notoriety just might help jump start her bed and breakfast inn! In the meantime, Sophie's got to keep an eye on her eccentric mother and rebellious teenage sister and her hands off the new neighbor who seems to be everywhere. She absolutely does not need to get involved with a man who obviously has secrets to hide. Nevermind that he has the body of a god, gives earth-shattering kisses and owns a '74 Jaguar XJ6.Anne Stuart is back and I'm happy to report she is in fine form, indeed. Her descriptions of the Vermont countryside are vivid, the plot is classic and the characters are varied and interesting -- from the mutinous Marty to the God-fearing town locals. The interaction between Martha Stewart wannabe (for the domestic goddess stuff, not the insider trading) Sophie and mysterious John Smith aka Griffin is sometimes farcical, always funny and downright steamy on occasion.

And this one sadly just misses. It seems rather rushed, almost like she did not have time to fully form the lead characters in her mind.She still delivers a powerful read!! Anne Stuart's 2nd best are still away ahead of the pack!!When Sophia buys a rundown inn, she moves her overly rebellious 19 year old half-sister and her mother, starting to lose control of her memory, into what she hopes it to be the answer to her problems and an island of peace. But that peaceful dream is shattered by echoes of murders commited 20 years ago. A man has rented the cabin across the lake, John Smith, and from the start, Sophia resents his presence, resents his virile attraction and would like him to leave.The tension builds as we are told he was convicted of the death of the three girls who were murdered two decades ago, though released from prison after only 5 years. We learn John has few memories of that night and recalls nothing until he awoke covered in blood in the cabin.John feels it is time to stir the embers of the past, find out who really commited those murders - even if it was himself, and finally put the past to rest once and for all. Stuart never convinces us he could have been guilty, so she throws away that bad to the bone Alpha male she conjures so deftly in Moonrise and others.Stuart's tension between Sophia and John is excellent, but I don't think she had full grasp of just who John was because there are numerous conflicting errors in descriptions (shame on the editor, too!!) - which leads the reader to not fully know John either. The rebellious teen grated on my nerves - I read to escape the pains-in-the-rumps of the world, so this character really wears thin. But in a way, I guess that helps you empathise with Sophia - through it is with slightly gritted teeth!I applaud Stuart for giving us a down to earth 'real' woman in Sophia who is more than willing to eat that second or third muffin, to give a sweet, tragic quality in her mother facing growing less and less able to live by herself. However, some readers just might think all of this is a little too real....lolIt is still a fine book, I just wish it could have been tightened up and not have that rush feel about it. There is no one better at giving us the bad-boy we cannot resist. Just think this one would have benefited from finetuning before being sent to the publisher (or an editor that took his job seriously and caught these mistakes before they got into print).Even with the flaws, I truly enjoyed it and remain a loyal and devoted Stuart fan!!"},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Still Lake\\" I am not much of a contemporary romance reader, but if there's suspense and thriller, I never pass it up! An added bonus were some pretty hilarious moments that had me laughing out loud. The main characters are Griffin (aka John Smith) and Sophie. They have this love-hate thing going with a lot of sexual tension. There's Sophie's mother, \\"Spacey Gracey\\" who just cracked me up and Sophie's \\"rebel without a cause\\" younger sister, Marty. (I won't summarize the story, since other reviewers have done so). The reason I gave the book only 4 stars was due to the fact that the plot was rather weak. I was hyped up in finding out \\"who done it\\", but I figured it out immediately. No surprises or mystery about it. It seemed that the whole story was mainly focused on Griffin and Sophie completely and their \\"blossoming\\" affair. There were no real thrills and chills in connection with \\"finding the killer\\" before he strikes again. All in all, I'd say it was a good erotic romance story, the down and dirty type in some parts...LOL. But if you are looking for those certain \\"thrills and chills\\" in finding out \\"who done it\\" or \\"why he or she done it\\" I do not recommend this book. I recommend Anne Stuart's other novel, \\"Into the Fire\\"...Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Sophie Davis writes a column providing household advice. &quot;The poor woman's Martha Stewart&quot;, Sophie doesn't get much of a chance to actually apply that advice - until she buys an old inn in Vermont, and moves her mother and sister along with her. The inn was the setting for a gruesome triple-murder twenty years ago, but Sophie doesn't care much about that aspect of her new home. She's intent on renovating and decorating the place, although she's not too eager to have strangers invade her sanctuary. However, she knows that this is the only way to maintain an income in such a small city.Sophie's life gets even more complicated when the enigmatic John Smith rents an old abandoned cottage near her inn. Why is he there? It's obvious to Sophie that his name is not really John Smith, and he seems to be asking way too many questions about the old murder, yet she can't figure out his true identity. Meanwhile, Sophie has other problems. Her mother, Grace, is slowly slipping away as she battles Alzheimer's disease, and her sister, Marty, is going through an extreme teenage rebellion stage. And why is Sophie so intrigued (and a little frightened) of John Smith?Anne Stuart has created a gorgeous story of finding love when you least expect it. Both characters have issues, and they're as different from one another as could be, yet when they're around each other, sparks fly. The tension and attraction between them is strong, and the reader immediately gets pulled into their relationship, rooting for Sophie and John to make it despite their differences and the obstacles thrown at them.The beautiful scenery and atmosphere works as a wonderful backdrop for the story. My only complaint is that I had the &quot;bad guy&quot; figured out about 1/4th through the story, so the ending didn't come as much as a shock as perhaps it should have. Still, the romance and the incredible sensuality in this story were enough to keep me eagerly turning pages until the end."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"The mystery is easy to figure out but that's okay because the story is mainly about the developing relationship between Sophie and &quot;John Smith&quot;. The secondary characters, Sophie's sister, Marty and Grace, her mom who seems to be failing mentally add enough to keep the story interesting.A good fast summer read."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewStill Lake starts off with an unsolved murder in a beautiful Vermont town. The whole story is swirled around and clouded with suspense and mysteries. It isn't difficult to identify the real killer but you won't be sure until you read through the book. The portion of romance is quite little when comparing to the suspense and mysteries."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"I enjoyed the book. It wasn't difficult to figure out &quot;whodunnit&quot; but the cast of characters kept my interest. The romance was fairly typical but the people weren't. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a break from their problems for a few hours."},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Deciding she needed a change from her complex Manhattan lifestyle, advice newspaper columnist Sophie Davis relocates to Colby, Vermont where she plans to run an inn. The poor man's Martha Stewart takes her seemingly senile mother and her raging hormonal teenage half sister with her.To Sophie's chagrin, as she wants no nearby neighbors, John Smith moves into a nearby cabin that has not been used in six years. John is actually Thomas Griffin who was convicted of murdering three teenage girls twenty years ago, but was freed five years later on a technicality. Thomas has come back to Colby to learn what really happened on that night in which he remembers nothing. As John and Sophie begin to fall in love, an eerily similar homicide similar to those of past occurs just two weeks before the grand opening of Stonegate Farm.STILL LAKE is an exciting romantic suspense novel starring intriguing lead characters struggling with problems that leave both not welcoming love into their respective lives. Though Sophie is a bit too responsible, she represents the sandwich generation with troubles from her senior and her younger that surround her. Thomas is a wonderfully bewildered protagonist who does not know if he committed those murders. The support cast provides depth by enabling the audience to better understand what makes Thomas and Sophie tick as well as adding suspense to Anne Stuart's fine contemporary tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Still Lake","review":"Convicted of the brutal murder of three nubile girls in Colby Vermont he did not commit, Thomas Griffin returns to the grisly bucolic Still Lake to uncover the murderer and jolt his memory under the guise of a journalist John Smith. His enigmatic presence is unwelcomed by Stonegate Inn owner sans neigbor Sophie Davis. Disconcerted by her sister's pubescent attraction to the man, she fears John will lead her astray. Even her crime novel addict of a mother has been steeped in illusions since his arrival, accusing him of being the frightful serial killer that terrorized New England two decades ago.Anne Stuart's murder-...-mayhem novel explores the deranged and the nihilistic as in her past suspense thrillers such as Moonrise. However the omnipresence of danger and erotic edges saturated in her earlier works falters here probably because of the unsatisfying length and a too predictible who-dun-it. What is unique about Ms. Stuart's romantic suspense though is her thoroughly unconventional protagonist who realistically emerges from our humdrum lives. Sophie isn't all glamor; she juggles with a crumbling dysfunctional family and a job as the poor woman's Martha Stewart and worries about assimilated calories because she is on the plump side. Her hero Thomas is dark, shadowy and even sinister with a complex that borders on danger. This oddball couple adds depth and smoldering sexual chemistry to this otherwise mediocre effort from Ms. Stuart."},{"Title":"An Invitation to Fly (Basics for the Private Pilot)","review":"A clear and concise approach to the essential information necessary for the student pilot. I often referred to this book during my training. It gives clear and well explained examples utilizing real world aviation problems. The section on weather is excellent for primary training as well as a reference.This book covers all topics relevant to private pilot training without beating any subject to death. The excellent graphics and pictorial examples help to make semingly complex topics simple. I think this book is an indispensable resource for any student pilot. Particularly useful is the section on cross country flight planning which brings all of the stages of flight planning together in a good example of a cross country flight."},{"Title":"An Invitation to Fly (Basics for the Private Pilot)","review":"I have been self studying aviation and all that it entails for some time now. Initially started buying all sorts of reading material. Soon learned I could spend a small fortune in just books alone. Some aren't very good, others are strictly technical, in short not what I needed.This book may seem pricey to the uninitiated; don't let it throw you. The information provided under one cover is very concise and intuitive. It is not meant to be the end to all study and info gathering. Yet, it touches on most areas of flight knowledge. You'll learn how to use and interpret the E6-B flight computer, how a good flight plan is put together, FAR's, AIM...and just what are all those charts associated with navigation?

I read it on a whim and was so enchanted with it, i couldn't put it down until finished. I found myself at work, wondering about what would happend to Riah when I got home and started to read it again.The story: Recently widowed Riah picks up her four children in search of work in the 1830's. She finds herself housekeeper and caretaker to an eccentric single master. He teaches her four children, not only to read, but all the classical learning well above their class level. It brings more trouble..... i don't want to give away the story, but i didn't think all that happened in the 1830's. Catherine Cookson made me believe.Definitely a good read.... a little sappy because i guess eveything kind of ends for the most part happily."},{"Title":"Blk Velvet Gown","review":"Some people didn't like The Black Velvet Gown as much as Catherine Cookson's other work. I have to say the DVD of The Black Velvet Gown was my first introduction to Catherine Cookson and I was immediately hooked. I read the book to fill me in on areas of the DVD I didn't quite get. This is still one of my favorites on two fronts. It shows what any person can do with an education and what any woman can do with an education. The female characters are very strong. At the same time it shows all the complexities of class and economic exploitation. Cookson never sugar coats her stories. They are always raw and never judge the difficult choices people make in order to survive while nonetheless suffering the consequences."},{"Title":"Blk Velvet Gown","review":"I didn't realize that the education of the \\"lower\\" ranking classes in the late 1800s was such a controversial issue till I picked up this book. For a Cookson novel, it was a tad disappointing.. I have come to expect a bit more out of her. It had an interesting enough start beginning with a woman named Maria and her four children. Her husband has just passed away of Cholera, leaving her with two sons, two daughters, and a small bag of money in a mining town that wishes to kick them out. After being turned aside by her own family, Maria takes a journey that leads her to a manor house with a peculiar master. The master provides a roof over her and her children's heads in exchange for her housekeeping skills. He also takes it upon himself to educate her children. This is not without its price, however.At this point, it gets interesting.. The master has an inappropriate attraction to Maria's older son. There are some scandalous occurences and the famly is split apart as blackmail enters the picture.The last half of the novel is about Maria's daughter, Biddy, who at this point is educated and according to the \\"gentry\\" and their servants, doesn't know her \\"place.\\" As she enters the laundry service at a larger estate up the road, readers see how badly educated lower class people were treated. Biddy makes a stand tho and begins teaching others to read. At this point, it is a war between upper and lower class and educated versus uneducated. Can Biddy survive the struggle at the big house? Will Maria find happiness despite the restrictions her \\"master\\" has put upon her?Interesting but not one of Cookson's best."},{"Title":"Blk Velvet Gown","review":"I have over 15 of her books.

The stories show how adversity can be overcome."},{"Title":"Blk Velvet Gown","review":"I love Catherine Cookson and found this book to be just as enchanting and enjoyable as her others. She is such a wonderful storyteller and this story, though somewhat dark, is comparable to the other books of hers.

Being an avid garage saler myself, I could really relate to how she described that life and the treasures she would find along the way.

It is a 10,000 foot view of New Testament issues hung on the framework of a history.He sets up the meat of the book with the history from Alexander the Great through the Hasmoneans to the time of Christ. It is here that the dynamics and some of the later players are introduced, such as the Hasmoneans, the politicization of the high priesthood and Herod and his family are introduced. It sets the stage and makes the context of the New Testament very understandable. The primary source he uses for his historical framework is Hayes and Mandell's \\"The Jewish People in Antiquity\\". They provide the bulk of his footnotes and explanations. He utilitzed them to the extent that I also purchased their book for further reading.Witherington is not content to give a \\"just the facts\\" narrative of the years of Christ and the spread of Christianity. He gives an introduction to Jesus and how His message and ministry was seen as radical. He demonstrates that it was no accident that Jesus went to the cross. The brilliant part in all of this is that he does it without the academic tedium. If you want it, he points you to fuller discussions through the footnotes. These usually point to his other works, primarily \\"Christology of Jesus\\" and his commentaries on Mark, Acts, and Galatians. The point is that the text holds together without the fuller discussion. I have the books mentioned and have read Christology. It is interesting reading, but isn't necessary to get full benefit from this book.Witherington spices up the text and story with theories and other research. For instance, he states that the \\"Beloved Disciple\\" is a Judean disciple, not a Galilean, thus ruling out John, son of Zebedee. He presents the Last Supper as a furtively held celebration that would be seen by the powers that be as insurrection. He doesn't stick to the main roads in his presentation while presenting plausible and thought-provoking narratives of the ministry of the Lord.His presentation of the spread of Christianity presents a lot of great material on the social, cultural and political context into which Christianity spread. These insights almost become a Biblical backgrounds resource. The discussion of the North/South Galatian theory and his background on the major cities and the churches therein make the New Testament come alive. He has many \\"Closer Look\\" sections and backgrounds on principle cities that add much insight to the narrative. During the last few chapters, he goes into the writing of the New Testament books. You may disagree with his dates and theories, but he gives his rationale and you understand where he is coming from and how he got there.I agree with the previous reviewer that the illustrations are sub-par as to quality. Also, there is no bibliography. But, this is a profitable introduction and guide to the history of Christianity and a valuable general resource book. I have read the detailed treatises on Jesus and New Testament studies and still found this book as informative as it was delightful to read."},{"Title":"New Testament History: A Narrative Account","review":"Ben Witherington has written a superb book about the emergence of Christianity. He begins by putting his narrative in appropriate cultural context, and to do this takes the reader back beyond the time of Christ to the days of Alexander the Great and his immense hellenizing influence over the Midlle East. Once the stage has been set, author Witherington meticulously, but without being tedious, takes the reader through Christ's life in the eyes of the gospel writers, appropriately dwelling on Paul's works, then describes the differences between the the Jerulasem Church and the gentile churches denying Judaic influence, the fractiousness of early Christianity, the sporadic, convenient, and, focused violence of the Roman Empire toward the early Church, the origins of apocalytic literature, and finally leaves the Church in the grips of Domitian. Witherington has a firm grasp of the historical contingencies that shaped Chhristianiy's infancy, and uses dialogue boxes effectively to aid the reader in understanding the cultural undercurrents and contexual idioms that guided and limited the gospel writers' efforts.One small criticism is worth noting: the quality of illustrations does not match the quality of the author's writing. Aside from that small quibble, this is a scholarly work that treats its complex subject with depth and insight and yet is accessible to the general reader. This work is clearly good news about good news. The authors of the gospels would definitely be proud, and, perhaps, actually they are."},{"Title":"New Testament History: A Narrative Account","review":"For years, FF Bruce's New Testament History ruled the roost. Now we have an NT history for the 21st century. Ben Witherington tells the tale of New Testament History, beginning way back in the 4th century BC with Alexander's conquest of the western world. Alexander's philosophy of spreading Greek culture and wisdom throughout the world affected the culture and milieu of the New Testament world.Witherington then speaks of the Ptolemaic rule over Palestine, followed by the Syrian conquest and the Maccabean revolt and then of course Pompey's takeover of Palestine in 63 BC.It is into this political climate that Christ was born in Bethlehem. Witherington contends vigorously for the historicity of the Lukan account of Christ's birth, and that the story of Jesus' birth bears little resemblance to the birth stories of the pagan gods. Ben also demonstrates that it must have happened around 5 or 6 BC.He also discusses the Sicarii (the dagger men), showing the likelihood of their existence prior to the reign of Nero in the 60's AD.He discusses the Pharisees and the Sadducees and their response to the ministry of Jesus.There is also a irenic discussion of the last week of Jesus' life, and Ben discusses how people were crucified in the ancient world, and he adds the interesting tidbit that crucifixion may have been inaugerated as a Jewish form of punishment that was utilized and adopted by the Romans.Dr. Witherington also defends the essential historicity of the gospel descriptions of the last week of Christ, as well as the unlikelihood of anyone fabricating a resurrection story where the women believe it and the men don't.There is also a lengthy discourse on Paul's three missionary journeys and how they comport with what we know from Paul's letters, particularly in the book of Galatians.Witherington also reveals the essential anti-Semitic character of the Roman emperors, and how they tended to see Christianity as an offshoot of Judaism until perhaps the Neronic persecution of Christians in the early sixties AD.Ben holds that Mark was the first Gospel written, and that Matthew and Luke relied on Mark as a source.He also discusses the sad sack of Jerusalem by Titus and his legions in 70 AD, noting that while the Jewish forces out up a good fight for years, internal backbiting and conflicts between differing Jewish leaders helped to seal their doom. Ben is a sympathetic and compassionate guide through the last days of the Jewish nation as he somberly reports the suicide pact that was apparently made at Masada, save for the few who hid in a cistern and survived to tell the tale. Ben also mentions that most of the Christians had fled by the time Titus conquered Jerusalem, perhaps to the town of Pella.There are sections throughout the book where Ben discusses different topics, such as Magic in the Ancient World and the ransoming of souls. There also capsule descriptions of towns and cities mentioned in the New Testament, as well as sidebar discussions on topics ranging from whether or not Mark is an ancient biography to whether or not Paul grew up in Tarsus or Jerusalem.The book is subtitled \\"A Narrative Account,\\" and indeed, the book reads like an engaging story. You really get involved in the lives of those whose stories are told, and even more, you get caught up with the movements inherent in New Testament History.I highly recommend this book. I have read it two times, and I can't say that, (nor would I want to say that) about too many biblical studies books, tepid as they can be. But Ben is a great writer, and you will want this on your shelf and in your hands."},{"Title":"New Testament History: A Narrative Account","review":"New Testament History: A Narrative Account by Ben Witherington III (Professor of New Testament at Asbury Theological Seminary) begins with the life of Jesus, and follows the evolving and expanding movement of Christianity through the centuries afterward. Extensive research not only with regard to Biblical sources, but also such fields as Jewish and Roman history, lace the text of this methodically and insightfully presented discourse. New Testament History is a very highly recommended contribution to New Testament and Christian History Studies for students, academics, and non-specialist general readers alike."},{"Title":"New Testament History: A Narrative Account","review":"Ben Witherington's New Testament History: A Narrative Account is a helpful and easy reading book about the New Testament era. For those looking to begin wading into the life and times of the first century, this is a great book.Like many New Testament histories, Witherington starts out with the history before the first century - specifically, the rise of Greece. Though this is typical of other New Testament histories, it is necessary in order to understand the politics of Rome and Judah during the first century. It goes on to thoroughly describe the world of the early church.I guess that its weakness lies in that it didn't grip me. My hope was that a narrative account of history would in some way be different than typical presentations of history. It wasn't. It was a good read. It was historically and Biblically accurate. But it didn't seem to me to be much different than other Christian history books that I've read (Walker, Cairns, Hastings, Gonzalez, etc.).If you've never read a good New Testament history book, this one is certainly recommended. But, if you have, then you will probably not gain any significant additional insight from this book.For a full review of this book, go to the blog listed in my screen name above and click on the 'Readings' link under Categories."},{"Title":"New Testament History: A Narrative Account","review":"This wasn't quite the book I was expecting it to be. I checked it out of the library wanting a book to give me the historical and cultural background for the New Testament, as Lawrence Boadt's Reading the Old Testament had similarly done for me. Mostly, it does have the background, but it also goes on for quite some time about just what was going on with Jesus's life and the missionary journeys of Paul as related in Acts, teasing out the details based on close analysis of what is written. That was a little more than I needed, particularly since I had been through the same with the annotations in the Oxford Annotated Bible and with Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Bible. Also, since I'm not a believer (the author is), there's a lot of this stuff I don't really care about. However, I can see that for a believer this book would be much more interesting and useful than it was for me.

It is a real gem! As the publisher points out, the backbone of her philosophy is The Power of Right Thought, an ageless topic.The concepts in her book are incredibly simple. But therein lies their complexity. In her first \\"thought\\" she writes: the young men of France are studying alchemy, hoping to learn the secret of the transmutation of gold. But if you will study your own spirit and its limitless powers, you will gain a greater secret than any alchemist ever held; a secret which shall give you whatever you desire.Now that is some promise! And with serious, repetitive \\"thought work,\\" it is possible. Ms. Wilcox explains why we need to control our thoughts and how we can achieve this. She describes various facets of the mind and how it is used to heal or to maim. But do not be tricked by the refreshing simplicity of her writings, nor put off by her sometimes stern manner. Each word is worth its weight in gold.This book is like a chat with a good friend. Its words speak directly to the heart and urge us to be just a little more us. You will find that you turn to the book for inspiration, wisdom, companionship... Its words can be read over and over and each time yet another facet (of yourself) revealed.Ms. Wilcox jars our thinking, and challenges us to become who we really are. At the same time she makes us laugh at ourselves and our gullibility. Forget about complaining, there are no obstacles, why worry...Remember, Man is what he thinks. And she repetively reminds us of this as well as of our own Divinity. Powerful stuff indeed!Ernest Holmes drew on her teachings in his creation of the Science of Mind Philosophy.

This book captures the entire story of Brett's career where he had a lifetime average of .305, 3154 hits, and 1595 runs batted in. Great photos and layout compliment the authoring by Steve Cameron. It includes a great section that has quotes and comments from players, coaches, and writers, that have watched George Brett move from a shaky Single A player to the Hall of Famer that he is. Another feature in this book is that George Brett shares his thoughts, emotions, memories, his recollections, and his feelings about the long journey. It captures the entire story of Brett's career from childhood through his many years with the Kansas City Royals. It also does an outstanding job of building an understanding of why Brett is so passionate about the game of baseball. Here is a quote from George on how he would like to be remembered. \\"I'd like to be remembered as the guy who always played hard and ran out every ball.\\" Although George has made it to the Hall of Fame he thanks many for his success.

This book captures the entire story of Brett's career where he had a lifetime average of .305, 3154 hits, and 1595 runs batted in. Great photos and layout compliment the authoring by Steve Cameron. It includes a great section that has quotes and comments from players, coaches, and writers, that have watched George Brett move from a shaky Single A player to the Hall of Famer that he is. Another feature in this book is that George Brett shares his thoughts, emotions, memories, his recollections, and his feelings about the long journey. It captures the entire story of Brett's career from childhood through his many years with the Kansas City Royals. It also does an outstanding job of building an understanding of why Brett is so passionate about the game of baseball. Here is a quote from George on how he would like to be remembered. \\"I'd like to be remembered as the guy who always played hard and ran out every ball.\\" Although George has made it to the Hall of Fame he thanks many for his success. George would later add in his Hall of Fame speech a thought about his parents. George said,\\" To my parents, Jack and Ethel. Thanks for the endless hours of support and love. You taught me the qualities of life that I will pass along to your grandchildren, Jackson, Dylan, and Robin. I would recommend this book to all players in high school, College, and the Minors because of the lessons it teaches about respect for the game and a personal commitment to excellence."},{"Title":"George Brett: From Here To Cooperstown","review":"This book is the heart and soul of George Brett.

I was hoping for a little more substance about his playing days and his life in general, but the book was still fairly informative. It seemed to focus mostly on getting into the Hall of Fame (which actually makes sense from the title). I would not classify this as an autobiography. I would say this is more of a first person review of getting into the Hall.

The preface and last chapter are by far the best parts. Noted technology commentator Richard Thieme (\\"Islands in the Clickstream\\") gives the preface. A mere 4 pages. But very eloquent and lucid. A joy to read. The last chapter is a semi-ficticious narrative of how a hacker breaks into various computers. Unix and network experts will like the depth and ingenuity described. It can be very educational, even for experienced sysadmins.But other chapters are poorly done. For example, Chapter 2 is on Theoretical Characterisation Metrics. It repeatedly uses various conditional probabilities, but with a wrong notation. For a probability of B given A, it uses p(B)/A. The standard notation is P(B|A). Used for decades in statistics course. First year undergraduate level.Other chapters, presumably written by different people, do use the correct notation. But Chapter 3, on the Cyber Food Chain, has an even more disturbing flaw. It has tables of what it calls mean inhibitor values. Derived from sets of values with only 1 significant figure. But the means are given to 4 significant figures! At best, the means only have 2. What this author is doing is imputing a false accuracy of 2 extra significant figures, or 100 times greater than actuality. More strictly, it is probably close to 1000 times greater, because the mean is really no better than one significant figure.So what? Well, given that the authors goof on such elementary steps, it should give you serious reservations about their more \\"sophisticated\\" operations, where they discuss various metrics.Another thing. One chapter's title is mis-spelled on the top of every page in the chapter. Irritating. Makes one wonder about the proof reading."},{"Title":"Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing the Hacker Mind","review":"I finished reading Cyber Adversary Characterization - Auditing The Hacker Mind by Tom Parker, Eric Shaw, Ed Stroz, Matthew G. Devost, and Marcus H. Sachs. This is a very different book than anything I've seen, read, or reviewed...Chapter breakout: Introduction; Theoretical Characterization Metrics; Disclosure and the Cyber Food Chain; Rating the Attack: Post-Incident Characterization Metrics; Asset Threat Characterization; Bringing It All Together: Completing the Cyber Adversary Model; WarmTouch: Assessing the Insider Threat and Relationship Management; Managing the Insider Threat; The Cyber Adversary in Groups: Targeting Nations' Critical Infrastructures; Characterizing the Extremes - Terrorists and Nation States; Return on Investment; Final Words; Glossary; IndexMost books that concern themselves with the \\"hacker mindset\\" do so with personality characterizations and attack methods. When you get done, you may understand how attacks occur, but you're no further along in doing a critical risk assessment of your particular environment. This book is the first I've seen that attempts to analyze the components mathematically in order to allow you to weight different scenarios against each other. The authors do a decent job in taking individual characteristics of the attacker, the environment, and the target, explaining how each component affects an attack scenario, and then giving a formula that can be used to assign a numeric value. While you may not agree with the interpretation, it's a rigorous approach to something that can be hard to quantify.I haven't decided whether I approve of the WarmTouch chapter. It's a software package developed by the authors that attempts to chart threat assessment from a person based on email wording, actions, and other observed behavior. The idea is interesting, but I normally have issues with a book like this being used to push an author's product. I'll just say buyer beware in this case...Bottom line... this would be a useful read for someone in security consulting and auditing, and would help an organization take a methodical view of their environment for risk assessment. There's not much on the book market like this volume."},{"Title":"Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing the Hacker Mind","review":"This book attempts to discuss a topic of great interest to me. Since there are no other books in print that address this topic, I eagerly bought the book with great expectations. Unfortunatly I have been highly disappointed.I highly recommend you avoid this book if you have an aversion to the gross butchering of the English language. I have found this book to be so far over the line of good writing that it is distracting. I haven't even been able to make it out of the second chapter! Sentence structures are unnecessarily complex and wordy. The text is replete with grammatical errors and misspellings. The author created terms to describe his concepts, yet the terms have other connotations, making it further difficult to understand. Parsing and understanding what the author is trying to say in certain passages is difficult at best. I'm sure if I had been in meetings with this author, I would know his language and intuitively understand what he means, but the new reader, devoid of that knowledge, is at a significant disadvantage. If this book had been properly edited, it would be about half its size. One has to ask what the publisher was thinking, or not.This is most unfortunate. The threat of cyber attacks against national interests and critical infrastructure is very high. Having a book that proposes a systematic methodology to help identify and address those threats would be most useful."},{"Title":"Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing the Hacker Mind","review":"I'm not a statistician or a risk expert, so I mainly view this book in terms of illuminating possible areas of risk. It was interesting to see how a threat could be evaluated, but I spent most of my time reading the initial threats portion at the beginning of each chapter. These were interesting enough.The text is a little uneven, which is most likely from the multiple authors. The graphics are poor quality. And the organization could use some work.I would have liked to have been inspired to appreciate the characterization portions of the book, but I was not moved to do so."},{"Title":"Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing the Hacker Mind","review":"Know thy enemy. This is only part of a famous quote by Sun Tzu. It is often quoted and is quite appropriate when discussing Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing The Hacker Mind (Tom Parker, Eric Shaw, et al, Syngress Press, 2004, 356 Pages, ISBN 1931836116). But to truly appreciate this book, which includes an account of Kevin Mitnick's first hand description of one of his attacks, you need to think about the entire quote from The Art of War: \\"Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.\\"The battle against hackers is not a single battle, but an on-going series of battles against an enemy that is often unseen and unknown. What the authors of this book attempt to do is offer a glimpse in the minds of hackers, what predisposes them to their behaviours, and an understanding of how this knowledge might be used to gain an advantage over this unseen enemy. To do so requires discussions of real events, psychology and modeling.As such, this book is not for everyone, especially those who want an easy read. Psychological modeling is a difficult task to not only do, but to understand. The authors do their best in making this as easy as possible to understand, but I know I still had to re-read some sections multiple times. If you read this book, you will not walk away citing parts verbatim, but you will have a good desk reference to use when needed.What is especially valuable in this book is the coverage of threats, both internal and external. The authors not only discuss this in terms and concepts, but offer methods to model and prioritize the threats. Have you ever thought about how myopic and narrow approaches can actually put you at greater risk?Who Should Read This Book?This is not a book for generalists. It really is for security specialists and students of security who want to get more than a superficial knowledge of the subject. Perhaps it might even be of interest to students of sociology and psychology. Tzu also said, \\"The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\\" That is the reason this book is one for the library of .serious students of the topic. If you do not fit any of these categories, you might want to steer clear. If you don't, know what you are getting into.ScorecardPar on an Par 4"},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"And real full strength Catherwood illustrations.Unlike some of the recent re-edited editions of Stevens' and Catherwood's work, this Dover Publications edition Volume One of the two volume &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan presents dense, complex, and revealing insights into a brilliant writer's impressions of travel in nascent Central American countries.Regarding his charge to enter into diplomatic relations with the governments of these countries, Stephens reports, &quot;I was not able to find one...&quot;In following Stephens eccentric and sometimes high-handed travels through these unsettled societies, we are by contrast in his ruminations given glimpses of the political and social climate in the United States at that time - a commercially predatory, exuberantly expansionist, segregated society. Despite the biases of his times, Stephens is always adaptable to the ways of his hosts.Although not great in number, Catherwood's illustrations of the stelae at Copan are truly great. His revealing comments on the difficulty of adapting his Western perception enough to capture the scenes even with the help of his camera lucida - tell us just how unusual the sculptural forms were.As a team - Stephen's enthusiasm and wry humor and Catherwood's sublime skill and dogged persistence - consistently produced great and discerning works of scientific and historical value.It should be illegal for anyone to edit or abridge these books."},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"This is one of the rare occasions when 5 stars doesn't measure up to the book being rated. I have read every volume of &quot;Incidents...&quot; many times (there are two volumes of this book, as well as two volumes of &quot;Incidents of Travel in Yucatan&quot;), and I've also given the four volumes as gifts many times. Additionally, I have traveled to most of the sites Stephens writes about, with book-in-hand, to simultaneously gaze with wonder at the magnificient sketches made over 150-yrs ago, and at the same objects sketched as they exist today. But this is not the only attraction of these volumes. Unlike most books about archeology, which are dry and overly academic, these volumes vividly recount the exciting, and often dangerous, day-to-day adventures of a couple blokes looking for ancient lost cities in a region that just happens to be smack-dab in the middle of a sanguinary 19th-century civil war. These books could be mistaken for a terrific adventure novel, were it not for the fact that every word is true. Stevens' graphic descriptions of the local characters and events is heavily laced with humor and insight. What a delight these books are. I think I'll start reading them (again!)."},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"As a resident of Mexico who enjoys my ruins and travel within Mexico, this book offers a fantastic glimpse into Mexico and the Yucatan long before it became a resort for Gringos. Not only is it well-written, but also has an excellent collection of visual drawings from a time long lost. An excellent book, and as is always with Dover, and excellent value."},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"I think this book is fascinating for two types of people:- Those who are interested in the history of Central America, who will see in Stephens a witness of time- Those very familiar with Central America's geography (specially Guatemala's), who will enjoy reading Stephens' descriptions of many places that (in their majority) still existIn 1839, at 34, John L. Stephens was appointed as \\"United States Minister\\" - a sort of US envoy - for Central America (which at the time was still one country). Stephens was a serial traveler: 5 years ago, he had visited Eastern Europe (Greece, Turkey, Russia and Poland) and the Middle East (Egypt and Syria), and had already published a couple of books about these trips.Stephens decided to combine his diplomatic duty with his interest in searching for Mayan ruins in the region. By October, he embarked with his friend Frederick Catherwood (another extensive traveller) in a trip that would take them to what was (already) a politically convulsed region.At the time, Central America was filled with political turmoil. The largest state of the country, Guatemala, had basically fallen in the hands of Rafael Carrera, a non-educated peasant. Carrera refused to recognize the authority of Francisco Moraz&aacute;n who, based in San Salvador, was at least in theory, the President of the Central American confederation. Rumours, political intrigues and suspicions abounded at the time.And so, in this setting, Stephens got into a boat, and after a few days in Belize, travelled (by boat again) to the Caribbean shore of Guatemala. He entered the country through Rio Dulce and touched land in a small village in the shores of the Izabal Lake.Starting there, Stephens made a trip, generally by mule's back, that took him to Zacapa, Chiquimula, Copan (in Honduras), Esquipulas, Guastatoya, Guatemala City (already established by then where it is now), Antigua Guatemala, Escuintla, Iztapa (in the Pacific shores) and Amatitl&aacute;n. He later took a boat and went to El Salvador, and then to Costa Rica, where he disembarked and returned to Guatemala by land.Apparently, Stephens was one of the first \\"adventure tourists\\" of modern times. He ascended many volcanoes and spent a considerable time in Copan, cleaning up the forrest that was still covering the ruins and helping his friend Catherwood to draw reproductions of the ruins (these drawings are included in the book). In addition, and as part of his diplomatic duties, he met some of the leading political figures of the time, like Carrera himself.Stephens not only did all the above, but ended up writing a very nice and enjoyable book that describes very well what he saw and thought at the time.In short, this book is a rare jewel that allows the reader to better imagine how was life and nature in Central America in the middle of the XIX century.(Note: the review above is based on Volume I - a book that curiously did not exist in Amazon's inventory at the time of my reading in 2005. Being respectful of my own past review, I havent' changed it. The next paragraphs though, are 2007 additions in which I comment on Volume 2)If the reader enjoyed Vol 1, she/he will surely find Vol 2 a satisfying read. Vol 2 starts in Nicaragua, and continues in El Salvador, where Mr Stephens continues in his search of a Central American government. I will not delve into the details of all of Mr Stephens' adventures. Suffice it to say that he gets to meet the recently defeated Francisco Moraz&aacute;n, meets Rafael Carrera (again), travels through the Guatemalan western highlands, gets to know the story of the Los Altos state, crosses the border to Mexico, visits Palenque and Uxmal, finally returning to the US.Its particularly interesting to read Stephens' account of Carrera and his young government. The fact that Carrera was even known at the time as the King of the Indians is an interesting point to notice -any reader knowledgeable with Guatemala's history and societal dynamics could extrapolate this to many events of the past 50 years.Also interesting is Stephens' rebuttal of previous accounts regarding the difficulty of visiting ruins like the ones in Palenque. The more widely known stories at the time created the impression that visiting the ruins was full of dangers. Always the practical and matter-of-factly adventurer, Stephens bluntly says that they are (were) untrue, and that the greatest hardships he and Mr Catherwood endured were due to the unstable revolutionary state of the countries.If the reader is interested or has knowledge of archaeology, he/she must also know that Vol 2 has plenty detailed descriptions and diagrams prepared by Mr Catherwood (who in my opinion was a very gifted artist, being able to draw the intrincated details of many Mayan ruins).I strongly recommend Vol 2 to anyone interested in Central American history, archaeology, the mayans, or true old-fashioned adventure travel."},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"A must for anyone who has already seen or is planning to visit Central America. Stephens writes with such enthusiasm on experiences so unique and groundbreaking. The text still manages to convey its original message of discovery with complete fasination, and is a timeless classic.

Many evenings, after a grueling day in the office, John L. Stephens transported me to another place and time with his excellent gift for writing, eye for detail and sense of humor that frequently had me waking my poor spouse with irrepressible laughter. As an author, explorer and humorist with the subtlest of wits, I place Stephens in the ranks with Mark Twain, and that is the ultimate compliment.

An IndianaJones kind of antiquarian (archeologist) is off to Central America toseek lost cities in the jungle. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is in a quandary because its newly appointed minister (ambassador) to the Republic of Central America has suddenly died. So, they offer the job to the archeologist - hey, he's already headed that way, right? - who accepts. Then, to make things even more complicated, it turns out that the Republic is in the throes of civil war, an historic upheaval which will determine the political divisions that are with us still, a century and a half later. Thus goes the basic story of &quot;Incidents.&quot; This particular edition is somewhat disappointing in that it has been abridged from the original, and most of the intricately detailed Catherwood drawings have been left out.

I was enthralled at the account of the author's extraordinary 1839 journey from Costa Rica to the Yucat&aacute;n&#8212;while civil war raged throughout Central America&#8212;in search of Mayan sites. The author's brilliance and erudition, his dry wit, his affectionate portrayals of locals met en route, his awe and respect for the advanced but ruined civilization he encountered, were enhanced by the meticulous illustrations of Frederick Catherwood.Volume 1 relates the first half of the journey; and, I must say, the lesser half. In its 400+ pages, Stephens and Catherwood explore exactly one Mayan site, Cop&aacute;n. The rest of the pages relate the journey by boat from the U.S. to Belize, onward to Guatemala, overland to the capital, various excursions and diversions, ending with Stephens crossing from Nicaragua to Honduras. A great deal of time is spent on a blow-by-blow account of the civil war which tore Central America, until then a unitary state, into warring fragments. While this would no doubt have fascinated Stephens's contemporary audience, the exhaustive detail may try the patience of all but scholars. Further, plans were underfoot to build a transoceanic canal through Nicaragua; and Stephens spends a great deal of time exploring the region and discussing the plan's feasibility. Up to Teddy Roosevelt's administration, Nicaragua and the Colombian isthmus (now Panama) were both in play as potential sites for such a canal, but we now know how it turned out, and the detail lavished on the losing proposition, again, might strain the lay reader's interest.I would recommend starting with Volume II of this book, and then reading Incidents of Travel in Yucatan. Both are fascinating accounts, chock full of one fascinating Mayan site after another, and offer the thrill of original discovery that Stephens and Catherwood shared during their groundbreaking expeditions."},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"For those interested in ancient Mesoamerica,Karl Ackerman has done an excellent job of editing the original two volume edition in oder to produce a single volume that preserves the essential information about Mesoamerica found in the original edition.He has also included many modern and historical photographs that add to the original Catherwood engravings and enhance the readers ability to view and enjoy the oringal text. He has also included valuable historical data about Stephens (absent in the original) that detail how Stephens insight into the function and purpose of the engravings has been shown to be more correct than those proposed by early investigators of these cultures.The tightening of the prose and the absence of trivia makes this book a joy to read and I highly reccomend it to all those like me who are fascinated by the great cultures that existed on the American continent long before the Europeans arrived.Larry Poulsen"},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"Stephens writes about what he sees and experiences, with humor, insight and self-effacement that make the books hard to put down. With his two colleagues - a doctor and a painter - he crisscrosses Yucatan, visiting remote villages and paying the unenthusiastic Maya locals to clear the sites of ruins that have been untouched since the conquista. Stephens, while an amateur archeological aficionado was one of the first to connect the buildings at Chichen to Toltecs and their structures at Mitla and Tula, thereby forever changing the field.There are priceless descriptions of local fiestas, village life, relationship between whites, mestizos and Indians, the role of haciendas and the (often beneficial) role of the Church and its hedonistic padres in Yucatecan life. The humorous episodes often include Indios who continue to amaze Stephens with their servility and docility. I was impressed by the courage and determination exhibited by the three adventurers who repeatedly braved bouts of malaria, accidents, exhausting heat, Indian snoring and swarms of garrapatas, fleas and \\"mosquetoes\\" to explore stuffy caves, chambers and ruins that were forgotten even by the local villagers. It may be difficult to envisage that ruins in Stephens' day were in many cases small hills covered by the jungle or chaparral, which had to be cleared by human hands. 'Human' in this context of course means 'Maya'. Stephens I believe was one of the first to connect the humble and servile Maya to the fierce and proud warriors who built those incredible ruins. Many a time he meditates within the pages of the 2 volumes on how the Indian culture and Maya's sense of self were altered by living under the white rule. He also wonders how could those fearless conquistadors morph into spoilt and entitled Mexican ruling class. The only institution which seemed to (somewhat) function was the Catholic church. Its priests - carousing with women, drinking and gambling - seemed to be the only ones to care about Indian welfare. The travelers befriended several 'padres' and received much help from them.It is a credit to Stephens that anyone who travels the region will be able to use it as a yardstick with which to relate to local life. Despite the tumultuous history which (one might expect) gives the Maya every right to resent white people, they have retained an extraordinary ability to greet strangers with an open heart and a smile. And a way of life which, while in some ways harsh, is still grounded within the poetry that are the Maya languages, customs and religion. In other words, these are excellent books which became the golden standard for de Plongeon, Morley, de Charnay and the Thompsons who followed S. into Yucatan and are credited with subsequent discoveries. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan","review":"Amazon does not sell the second volume of this Dover edition, not to be confused with 'Incidents of Travel in Yucatan', which is another interesting two-volume set by John L.

The six books in the series of which this is number 4 all tie together to tell one story. It is the story of Garion, how he meets his destiny (and yes it is preordained - all part of a prophecy that had been operating for thousands of years) and the people who help or hinder him along the way. The story moves along with a good helping of plot and a small helping of travelogue, which is my main complaint about Jordan. Each book leads to the next and you are left wanting to know what happens to the people. There is his grandfather, aunt, wife-to-be, and friends against a hostile god, monsters and followers culminating in a massive battle to determine the fate of the world. The whole series is diverse enough to hold your interest through all the books and still want to know more at the end.

This book follows them as they flee into Algaria with an ailing Belgarath. Garion learns more of his past and further prophecy is fulfilled. Future shocks await Garion, and Ce'Nedra as they learn more about his past. This book is filled with both adventure and tenderness as Garion learns that he has close relatives who are living. This is a book I would recommend to anyone who likes epic adventures on a grand scale. There is laughter and tears, adventure and even love. David Eddings has, in my opinion, taken the next step beyond Tolkien. His book has a faster pace and a lighter, happier feeling."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Eddings is not well thought of amongst the more literate groups of fantasy fans. Nevertheless, his stuff is just outright fun. His characters are amusing, his plots interesting (if, admittedly, rather conventional), and his writing competent. This ain't Literature-with-a-capital-L, but it's enjoyable mind candy. One caveat: Eddings has a propensity for writing the same story over and over. Thus, The Mallorean differs in no significant way from The Belgariad. His other series are also very similar. If you don't like re-reading books -- or if you just think these books aren't worth re-reading -- don't bother with the sequels; but do give the Belgariad a shot."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"This book has so many wonderfully funny parts - Ce'nedra jumping up &quot;OH, NO!&quot;, Relg's and Taiba's &quot;little theological discussions&quot;, &quot;This isn't going to work, Rhodar,&quot; Anheg turned to the rotund monarch in disgust, &quot;What are we going to call her? The Overlady of the West?&quot;, and so on. I memorized what is given of Ce'Nedra's first speech. I love these books! Breathe deep, seek peace.

I read The Elenium before this and was hooked from the start.What I like about this book is that it keeps you turning page after page to find out what the plot will be.Eddings is also a most excellent writer whose style is concise, humorous, and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Some people have told me that they don't like the Belgariad because it drags on too long, but I disagree. I think that Eddings gives each of the five books in the series it's own distinct flavor and character, and that makes the entire series sufficiently entertaining to be worth reading. &quot;Castle of Wizardry&quot;, the fourth book in the Belgariad, has less action than the rest of the series, but it makes up for that by having more humor. There's lots of hilarious conversations and clever descriptions that poke fun at characters. It's the comic high point of a series that already very much tongue-in-cheek, and a delightful way to burn through a few hours of your spare time."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Against all odds, Garion manages to be surprised at the fact that he is the heir to the long-vacant Rivan throne, and hence the one destined to duel the evil god Torak. He deals with this with reasonable equanimity, all things considered. Then he takes the two most interesting characters he can find (Belgarath and Silk) and heads off to get the duel over with.The womenfolk are left behind to rally the armies of the western kingdoms, which thankfully all have different colored uniforms and completely different, though complementary, military strengths. But the whole campaign is really a diversion, you know... the armies of the West marching against hopeless odds to divert attention from the one bearing the dangerous artifact to the heart of the land of darkness... say, haven't I read this story before?"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"I don't know what it is about David Eddings that keeps you glued to his books. Is it his plots? No, they tend to be overly complex, even if they are linear. Is it his narrative? While he is definitely entertaining, Mr. Eddings often drags the story out a bit too long (hence, two 5-part series). Maybe it's the dialogue? It is, after all, highly witty.No, what keeps me turning page after page are Mr. Eddings' characters. I don't recall ever having a fondness even remotely close to what I have with Garion, Belgarath, Pol, and Silk.That's why this book stands out as my favorite of any of his novels. This book best demonstrates the bravery, yet naivete of Garion while contrasting Ce'Nedra's strength against her fragility. It defines the true roles of their companions and sets up the confrontations and fates that await them. It goes beyond what most fantasy novelists write and gives us a truly fantastic epic.Read this book. Every page is worth it."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"The Belgariad as a whole is an entertaining piece of work. The stereotypical characters are fun to watch and listen to, and the plot doesn't tax your senses or raise the tension too high that you stop being entertained and actually start worrying about whether the heroes are going to make it or not. For those who haven't read the rest of the series yet, I'll recap quickly. It's the story of a young hero named Garion who has no idea he is the descendant of kings of old, whose destiny is to reclaim his ancient throne and kill the mad god Torak. He's aided in the quest principally by his Aunt Pol and his grandfather Belgarath. Other memorable companions include the wiley thief/merchant/spy Silk, the flightly princess Ce'Nedra, and the knight Mandorellen. Compared to the rest of the books in the series, Castle of Wizardry is a standout in this regard because this is where the lull in the story occurs. Readers that require it get some breathing room. This is the calm before the storm. As such, I don't find it to be as entertaining as the next book in the series. Nevertheless, you do get a lot of playful banter and relatively safe plot. The characters get to explore their own selves for a little bit, as opposed to being acted on by a whole lot of external forces in the previous books of the series. I like this book precisely because we learn more about the characters themselves. We find out the who and the why behind a prophecy that's thousands of years old. We get to follow the progress of a young kitchen scullion (Garion) who would be king of half the world, as he learns more about the extraordinary family of which he is the latest, and arguably the most important, member. We get to see old companions from previous books return. We get to see all the preparations being made for a titanic battle between the West and the East, and the struggle of a young hero to find a way out of all the bloodshed to come. Though it doesn't try to reach the level of literature with a capital L, it does obliquely ask some interesting questions. The question of how a mortal man can kill an immortal God is an intriguing one, and Castle of Wizardry ends on a rather high point by asking the question but not providing any hint of an answer. Overall I liked Castle of Wizardy. I think it's the best of the series behind the final book, Enchanter's End Game. Sure it's not high literature, but it's great &quot;safe&quot; reading for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"I've read all the books in the Belgaraid seris but this one's my favourite!! I was reading the other reviews and I just can't understand how people could not like the book!! But then I'm only a teenager whilst others are adults so my bottom line is: this book is great for younger people because from an adult's point of view the book might be too immature and boring."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"It is in the nature of David Eddings that, no sooner does the plot head for its climax, but he starts to slow down. I think there is something in him that does not love endings. So now that Garion, Belgarath, and Polgara have regained the Orb you would expect they would quickly go on the attack. No such chance. Eddings has grand plans, and we are going to get every detail.Belgarath is literally comatose from his battle with Ctuchik. Getting him to safety and retrieving C'Nedra are the big priorities, since it is time for Garion to return to Riva and accept the throne. And it is time for C'Nedra to present herself in that same throne room as the Tolnedran bride for the Rivan King. Thus much of the first half of Castle of Wizardry is spent on various domestic scenes where either Garion is bewailing his new responsibilities or C'Nedra is having fits about marrying a kitchen boy from Sendaria. This is comic relief before the tough get going, and there are many wry moments.Then suddenly Garion realizes that the real game is deadly and that many lives could be lost before his final meeting with Torak. Enlisting Belgarath and Silk, Garion decides to skip the battles in between and head directly for the final confrontation, jilting C'Nedra and leaving Polgara in a spectacular rage in the process. Now the story splits in two as Garion travels through Drasnia on the was to Torak's resting place and C'Nedra begins to rally the armies of the West in order to divide the attention of the Angaraks.This volume contains one of the most touching story arcs in this epic. Garion, Belgarath, and Silk find themselves caught by Vordai, witch of the Drasnian swamps. She forces Belgarath into a surprising bargain, one that beautifully displays Eddings ability to write something else besides light, sarcastic prose. In a sense, this episode makes the wait worth it.As characters both Garion and C'Nedra do a lot of growing up in this volume. Although Garion will always be a bit bewildered and C'Nedra will never be 'reasonable.' But the requirements of the plot will put both of them and their relationship to the test.I enjoyed this book, but it is very much over-written. Eddings frequently puts the plot on hold for side stories and long conversations. Many of these are interesting, or at least funny, but there are times when you just which something would actually happen. Eddings will never really break this writing habit, though it is sometimes mitigated. As such, Castle of Wizardy may displease the impatient."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Garion, Belgarath, and group have just managed to retrieve the Orb of Aldur, and Chutchik managed to annihilate himself, and that's where this book continues.It starts off decently, as the group has to escape from Cthol Murgos with the Orb, and the odd little child Errand. Of course, half of the Murgos and most of the Grolims are on their tail. Sadly, after this exciting escape, the book starts to get a little boring.Garion's destiny, as if it was ever in doubt, it finalized, along with Ce'Nedras. Things move along rather slowly for most of the rest of the book - even as Garion, Silk, and Belgarath sneak away to face Torak. The book never really reaches any sort of climax at the end like the previous three did, sort of simply building up for the fifth book.It's good, like the entire series is, but seems to serve little more than advancing the story, instead of really being exciting to read."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Here we have the fourth book of David Eddings' Belgariad. This book has many things going for it: action, comedy, romance, and surprise. Guess what it doesn't have? A castle of wizardry.Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall any such place. There is a castle. And a few folks who know something of sorcery stop by there for a while. But with that logic, they could also call this book: \\"Boat of Wizardry\\", \\"Swamp of Wizardry\\", or even \\"Horse of Wizardry\\". And who wouldn't want to read a book called \\"Horse of Wizardry\\"?Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let's move to the story. The knock on this book is that nothing much happens and thus this installment needlessly delays the climax.I don't agree. There's not as much action as the other books, but some critical things do happen regarding Garion and Ce'Nedra. Don't look for much from Barak or Mandorallen in this book. They're around but hardly do anything significant. Polgara and Belgarath have plenty to do and their banter is top notch as usual. Silk is more prominent than in past books and we get a brief glimpse into his back-story.And I was surprised that I enjoyed chapters with Ce'Nedra in it. In previous books, her character was somewhere between annoying and pain-inducingly annoying. In this book, she is more often than not one of the best sources of comedy. I laughed quite a bit.This is a decent book, but I only give it three stars simply because nothing about this installment is extraordinary. The few twists in the story are fairly predictable, and with little action, the meat of this book is just dialogue. Fortunately for us, this plays to the greatest strength of David Eddings."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Mild Spoilers aheadIn my review for Pawn of Prophecy I said that the Belgariad/Malloreon cycle is, in form at least, like a big Fantasy sitcom. This is most evident in this novel, where the episodic nature of the Belgariad is most evident. Extending that metaphor a bit, you discover that it's not really a fantasy sitcom (in book form of course) it's more a sitcom about an extended family set in a fantasy environment with fantasy tropes. There are similarities to The Princess Bride here, with that book essentially being a love story set in a fantasy setting and also very comedic.The practical upshot of all that is that your average fantasy fan expects the action to intensify at the beginning of this book, but it doesn't because that's not the main issue here. There are other things happening here, the story, in the course of this book, goes from being a slightly prototypical, straightforward quest story to being much more geopolitical, a process that is going on in the background through all the little episodes.There are a lot of little episodes too, this book is full to brimming with moments of pure Eddings wit. Most writers would love to have ONE such moment. Eddings has many, Garion and Adara, Barak and Meril, Polgara's worry over her father's possible psychic injury and the inability of his family to talk to him about it, C'Nedra's fear of public speaking, Lelldoren's story about his misadventures in Arrendia and most of all, Garion's fear for a people he has suddenly become the ruler of. For those of you who think the story should pick up here, think about this, without those episodic moments, we would not believe as audience that he would pick up a sword and head off to kill a God if we didn't understand his connections to the people around him.I think of all my reviews for these books as one big megareview (I'm writing these as I reread the series) and as such I can say this, the resonances that are set up in the first book, the many rulers and heroes and other characters you meet in book two (and three) and the explanation of who the \\"dry voice\\" in Garion's mind is in book three finally meet in this one. Here they finally become a tapestry instead of just seperate story threads. It is from these relationships that the characters will draw strength in the next book of the series, which is more the big climactic action piece.It is also worthy of note here that my personal favorite moment in all the Belgariad happens in this book when Garion returns to Faldor's Farm and sees his first love and realizes that that farm life just doesn't fit him anymore. There are few fantasy moments that acheive that level of emotion and can still make you laugh 2 pages later.Onward to Cthol Mishrak!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Castle of Wizardry is about a boy named Garion.

It caused a splitting in fate-everybody and everything had two completely opposite destinies which could be fulfilled. Over millions of years, two opposite prophecies were formed, each predicting a certain fate for the world. Through the years they moved closer and closer together. Finally, the Child of Light and the Child of Dark, the instruments of the prophecies, were almost ready to face each other in a battle to the death. The winner would determine the fate of the world.Castle of Wizardry follows the story of a boy called Garion, the Child of Light. It starts as he runs from the city of Rak Cthol where he and his companions reclaimed the Orb of Aldur, an ancient magical stone. The Orb had been stolen by a thief so that he could use it to awaken his evil god Torak from his sleep. After recovering the Orb, Garion and his companions traveled to Riva where shocking events occurred. Nothing could have possibly prepared him for the revelations which explain his past and reveal his future.This wasn't really a bad book. I've written reviews for the first three, and I said pretty much the same things in each of them: the plot's amazing, as are the characters, but the quality of writing isn't anything special. I really won't change any of what I said for this one.Really, the quality of the writing is the only problem. I think that there are a few parts which could have been worked on and would have made the book a whole lot better. It's sort of like a first draft. You get the idea put down, have some detail, all of that, but you still have to go over it, make it sound better, make more sense, add some detail, add some parts, take some out. I think that Eddings really didn't put as much effort into the final copy as he really could. As a result, you end up reading something which has some really good ideas, a really good plot, but you're occasionally skeptical of the writing quality. That's the only problem I can see in the book. Other than that, I would say that this is very exciting, and very good.Even though the writing isn't all that great, I'd still recommend it. The plot and characters just about make up for the writing, so overall this is a pretty good book..."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"David Eddings hit the Jackpot with his 5 book fantasy series &quot;The Belgariad&quot; and Book Four &quot;Castle of Wizardry&quot; continues, in great style this easy-to-read fantastic romp through the Kingdoms of the West. &quot;Castle&quot; is the next installment in the story of Garion, a simple farmboy, thrust into the adventure of a lifetime, in search of a magical Orb. &quot;Castle&quot; begins just after the recovery of the Orb and the death of Ctuchik, follower of the Evil God Torak, but if you think the quest ends here, don't despair, there is still plenty of dark magic, corrupt priests and one very irate evil God to provide plenty of entertainment and excitement for Garion and his companions. And for those softer at heart, there's just a little bit of romance thrown in as well. So don't be shy, join Garion, Belgarath, Polgara, Ce'Nedra and all their friends on an epic adventure.

In &quot;Castle of Wizardry&quot; armies are raised, groups split up, the kingdoms of the west unite and Garion, Kheldar, and Belgarath head out for the Mallorean continent to greet Torak with the sword of Iron Grip.A very exciting book that sets up everything for the climax of book five, and instantly captures your imagination, time, and attention, and then won't let go until you've finished the book."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"This book was overal worth my time (o:I really loved the fantasy and story line, but the travel was tedious and it took a while to get the point out.Definately worth reading though, the series is great and i cant wait to start on the next series.Please email me if you wanna talk about fantasy books in general (o:-Joe"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"This book is my favorite book of my favorite series.

The consistency with which Eddings develops his characters is amazing and fun to read. A good story for adults, and teens.

Not as good, perhaps, as a few other fantasy series I've read, but good nonetheless. David Eddings is a refreshing writer who does not fill up his books with swears and unnecessary sexual and nude scenes like so many other fantasy writers do these days. His books are very funny at times, and some of his characters are really well-developed. Others aren't quite so good, but it doesn't matter so much if you are just reading for entertainment. Like another reviewer said, I wouldn't read these books if you were looking for something deep and very well thought out and put together.

However, Castle of Wizardry to me is what young CP should have aspired to do with his title character (Eragon). Eddings is masterful at creating challenges that advance as the lead character matures. In my opinion this is the finest of the series thus far.I also recommend Jason Rider's Tucker O'Doyle series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Castle of Wizardry it the fourth book in the Belgariad saga by David Eddings. This novel picks up right where book three, Magician's Gambit, ended. That being, Garion and the gang have just recovered the Orb and are seeking to get it back to Riva. There are some very good reviews on-line in regards to what happens in this book, so I would repeat what they have already said.In terms of plot line and story quality, this book is rather one dimensional at times. There are very few side stories and at times the plot drags rather slowly. Just when the reader expects the pace to quicker and the story to move along, Eddings for what ever reasons slows the plot way down and the plot seems to stall at least two times in this book and the reader is forced to trudge along to keep going. It almost seems as though Eddings had a 5 book contract and came up a book short so he had to add some \`fluff' here and there to fill some pages. That's not to say that some of the \`extra' material isn't worthwhile, it just makes some stuff feel forced and non-genuine in how the story is laid out. In the end scheme of things, the over riding purpose of this book is to set up for the fifth and final book in this saga and it does that job just fine.The characters in this book continue to develop well, most notably Garion and his transition from kitchen scullion to that of a powerful force in the world. I like that Garion has doubts and flaws and is unsure of himself. He is not the all-powerful character that can't be beat that seems to be in most books now. However, my one main complaint about these characters are they are so clich?d it's almost laughable at times. There are scenes where even before you turn the page you know character X will appear with a bit of wisdom that will cause character Y to think and change their plans. I understand it is hard to write new material with as much fantasy as there is, but you also don't have to be so laddened with the clich?s that it takes away from the book either.With all that said, I did enjoy this book. I think the Belgariad is a good way to introduce people to the fantasy genre as there seems to be something in it for everyone. People who have read a great deal of fantasy may be a little put off by this, but if they look for the under lying story and read it for what it is I believe they too will enjoy this book. All in all I would probably recommend this book to people as there is some enjoyment to be found within its pages. I know I for one will finish off the saga, if for better reason than to see how it concludes."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Now Garion must reach Riva before it is too late.

Garion and his friends flee Cthol Murgos, where they killed the magician Ctuchik and recovered the stone of Aldur. The first half of the book tells the story of how they travel back to the western kingdoms, where Garion finally learns of the obligations his heritage brings. He has to make a very difficult decision regarding how to continue the fight against their enemy, the Angarak god Torak. He finnaly embarks on a journey to fight Torak, together with Belgarath and Silk. He leaves Ce'Nedra, Polgara and the rest of their friends behind to raise an army from all the western kingdoms to stop the invasion of the Murgo and Malloreon forces.This is the sequel to 'Magician's Gambit', and fourth in the amazing series of five books known as 'the Belgariad'. The series is later followed by another five in 'the Malloreon'. The story is the classic fight between the Evil which seeks to rule the world, and the Good which wants to save it, but what really makes the book so great is the characters. They are all very distinct from each other, with their own personality and desires. Eddings manages to keep them all separate, so that they are not mixed together in a faceless group. Instead they each have their part to play in the quest to save the world.I have read the entire series at least 20 times by now, and it remains my favorite fantasy. It is lighter than 'The Wheel of Time' series by Robert Jordan, which makes it suitable for younger readers as well, but it is great for anyone from around 12 to 112. I think many, like me, read this series as their first fantasy, and it is a great start to get interested in the world of magic and swordfights.

I even re-read them once every couple years just to see \\"old friends\\"."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Like many I know who have read this series, I too am a multiple reader, i.e. I have read them several times. This forth book continues the story and actually does it quite well even though it is a \\"transition\\" book,i.e., a book that sort of gathers loose ends and sets up the rest of the story. The first half is excellent but the second half rather drags a bit. But that is okay as it sets us up for the next. As a side note, I recently was unlucky enough to have an extended illness with much time on my hands. I read this series again, along with The Malloreon. I actually took a pen and started cross-referencing the pages of the ten books involved. I am now up to 233 errors/contradictions in these books. (yes, I know, I need a life). I do not mean this in a particular critical way though...the errors and contradictions only add to the charm of these classics. Recommend them highly to anyone wanting just a simple good read which is simply fun."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Simply great! The action really becomes intense in this book and everything starts to wind down to the final conclusion!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"The quest for the orb's climatic finish finally occurs in this book. Garion and everyone else in the group finally battle for the orb. In a dramatic battle, the orb is taken, and all seems well. This is the first half of the book, and it was a dousy.The second half of the book, however, is dull and tedious. No real adventure occurs. It's merely a read about the management and ruling of the world, and about the princess's feelings. Nothing more than that. The series takes a dramatic turn downhill after the orb is taken, and it is by far the worst part of the series. It's tedious and dull at this point.Edding has the usual stuff going for him - his language - the characters - the development of the prophecy - and the characters. The arguments between the slave women and the Ulgo are hilarious and witty. Though probably the worst book in the series, it is still not too bad."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I mean- I read all night long. When I finally decided to get some sleep, at four-thirty in the morning, I was halfway through the book. Even as I read on, I found myself holding my breath, laughing out loud and even crying. This book is the perfect combination of all emotions. I look forward to finishing the 5th. My fiancee has already, and he has to catch himself not to give the ending away. My advice to you- BUY THE WHOLE SET!!! It is soooo worth it."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"I enjoyed this book, this series, and has become one of my favourites. It is is light or heavy read depending on how much you want to get out of it. His characters have believable personalities, especially the ones who have lived thousands of years. Belgarath and Beldin have enough sceptisism and hope in their characters to make them truely lovable. The story itself is full of twist that kept me coming back. The only disapointment was Errand/Eriond, I guessed his fate before the end, but still wasn't to big of a disapointment, it finished so well. Eddings will be hard pressed to dupicate the sucess of this series. I hope he writes more with these characters. Did I detect a bit of sarcasism ? Mr. Eddings Thank you."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"The entire Belgariad series was excellent as was its sequel, The Mallorean, and its pre/sequel, Belgarath the Sorccerer. Eddings paints stunning mental images of the characters, giving them their own personal idioms and idiosynchracies, as well as letting them evolve, change, and adapt. His ability to write such long epics is elite. You are quickly enthralled in the stories, and just when you think the plot could end in Book 3, here comes Book 4 with a new unexpected twist. As was the case with Castle of Wizardry. It was another shining example of fantasy literature that can stand on its own, but will leave you needing to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"First, everyone is a critic, few get paid to do so.Any work has rave reviews and negative reviews. Take a chance and read it for yourself to be the final judge.Well, Unlike most reviews, I'm not going to 'book report' it and summize what happened... The climax of the entire Belgariad is steadily building, and the book is well written, setting fourth the final book and the fate of the universe.A+"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"David Eddings is a wonderful author. He was one of the first authors I ever read I first got into Fantasy, and he got me hooked for life!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Belgarath has destroyed his rival Ctuchik and now the company of companions have the Orb of Aldur. The company will travel to the Isle of the Winds where the orb will eventualy be fitted into a sword. Garion now becomes horrificly aware that he will have to face the mad god Torak in a one on one battle even though he is largely unsure of how to use his sorcerous powers.The Group is also joined by a former Murgo slave named Ariana, a temptress who delights in teasing the fanatically religous Relg.Over the four books Eddings has slowly and deftly built up the tension to the final book and the ultimate showdown between Garion and Torak. Eddings brilliance in character development shines again with the introduction of the Ariana character and her contatant tormenting of Relg. Eddings also builds the stress on Garion especially as he leads into the climax."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Although I like fantasy a lot, I don't have enough free time to read much of it. But I've read this series twice, and it remains one of my favorite works of fiction. I agree with other reviews that cite its awesome character development and witty dialogue as its strong points.The one detraction is the intra-cultural homogeneity. Such cultural stereotyping is not in vogue in the PC era, but in truth most societies do stress certain values. Eddings takes this perspective farther than I would prefer, but I think that the book is so entertaining that this weakness does not affect its overall credibility and readability. (Heck, the world has sorcery -- a little suspension of disbelief is in order!!!)Definitely read this book if you want to escape into a world of adventure, or if you merely want a good laugh. You can easily relate to the characters despite their larger-than-life abilities, which grants this series a personal touch that other fantasy novels lack. By the way, if I were a 7,000 year-old sorceror I would probably take to the bottle too, thank you very much.Magician's Gambit got me hooked, but Castle of Wizardry is probably the high point of Eddings's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Hands down the very best book I have ever read. The Belgariad series had me on the edge of my seat the entire time that I was read it. I have read the entire series at least a half a dozen times in the last year. Davie Edding is the finest writer I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"This book is my favorite book of my favorite series. I cried, literally at certain parts and was rolling on the floor laughing at others. No book could be as great as this :)"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"The first half of the book promised to be the best in the series so far, but once they reached the mysterious orb, the book seemed to climax and then meander to the end. (Which by the way, was hardly an end, but more a chapter break.) This time out it's really Garion's story for the first half, and Ce'Nedra's for the second, and as interesting as she's become, the politics and posturing to set up the final act dragged me down a bit. Hopefully the last book will finish with a bang and not a whimper."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Eddings starts to go downhill with this 4th volume of the Belgariad, primarily because the more the story expands, the more problems creep up. Always conventional, although fun, Eddings should've been able to keep material this simplistic from having so many logical gaps. Still, lots of clever dialogue (sometimes this is all that Eddings has going for him) and more adventures with his well-loved characters make Castle of Wizardry a good (if brain-dead) read."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Eddings certainly knows how to write an amusing, readable story. He has a fairly good sense of humor, the ability to keep numerous plot threads going without seeming confusing, and characters who are fairly likable.The flaws in his work are more basic. The series suffers from a bad case of &quot;Star Trek Worldbuilding&quot;: each country has a single personality. All the Tolnedrans are crazy about money. All the Sendarans are practical. All the Arends are brave and stupid. All the Mimbrates are romantic. With a few exceptions, there is almost no good worldbuilding.The characters, also, are not very good. They seem to have no idea that they are inhabiting a Heroic Fantasy novel. Come on, now: how many of you REALLY think that a ten thousand year old Noble Sorceror would find much attraction in getting drunk?Overall, Edding's stuff is sort of like the old epic &quot;cast of thousands&quot; movies which are fun to watch even if they're not very good simply because they've got huge casts and fancy costumes and lavish scenery. Castle of Wizardry is good for speed-reading on a hot summer day. But don't look to it for depth."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"As I said in my title &quot;The Castle of Wizzardry&quot; is the best book I have ever read (and that is saying something). It immediately starts off with the characters running for there lives, and continues to be so till about the middle. Then we come to the romantic part of the book which is just absolutely hillarious. Then my favorite part is the end, which is (with out a doubt) thrilling. I highly recommed this book, it is just so good. I have read at least a thousand books in my lifetime and I have never read a book this good. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"I love this series of books. I have read them many, many, many times and I am still reading them. I recommend them to everyone. Very humorous characters. If you are confused about the people read The Rivan Codex, in it David Eddings explains about how he based the characters. Anyway, I LOVE these books. GET THEM! GET THEM! GET THEM!"},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"I found that reading book four of the Belgariad that the story really grew on me. What started off as a simple story of adventure turned into something far more, and was a very enjoyable read.Story/StructureThe story still followed the very linear plot point procession. Characters go here, to here, to here and then to here, and finally to here. But what made this book enjoyable for me was the the switching of the POV character. About three quarters of the way into the book, after Belgarath, Garion and Silk left Riva, the POV Changed from Garion to Ce'Nedra, with Ce'Nedra finishing off the book.One of the things about this book I liked was that it went more into the background of Belgarath and his wife. You also get to learn a few things about Garions history and his purpose in the events to come and the terrible burden that was laid on his shoulders.While Eddings does a lot of telling intead of showing, I found this to be a refreshing change of pace. He could have easily gone into great detail about the events going on, including all of Ce'Nedra's speeches towards the end. Not only that, the telling cut down the chaff with Garion as he took to the throne of Riva and Overlord of the west. Typically telling is frowned on by writers, but here this works. It keeps the story moving forward without bogging it down.CharactersThe characters don't change much in this book. However, Garion and Ce'Nedra do. They grow up from being teenagers to being adults with tremendous responsibilities. Ce'Nedra espcially. She takes to the role of Rivan Queen very well.Outside of that the rest of the other characters haven't changed much and their personal stories sometimes comes to the for-front.DrawbacksThere was one minor annoyance in this book. The Necklace that Polgara gave Ce'Nedra. A plot device for the character to get information she otherwise wouldn't have gotten. There could have been other ways for this to happen, but they either didn't occur to the author or he felt this was the best way to get to the point and get Ce'Nedra to be where she was needing to be.OverallI enjoyed this book a lot. I gave it four stars because I only reserve five stars for truely outstanding books. But it is a very high four star rating. I found myself lauging a lot in this book because of some of the things Ce'Nedra does. I also liked Polgara more in this book, espcially reading about her \\"anger fit\\".As I said in my previous reviews these books are simply pure adventure and good vs. evil story. If this is what you are looking for then this series is for you.SRMSteve's Reviews: Honest reviews from an honest guy."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"In the fourth book of the Belgariad, The Castle of Wizardry, all the set up from the series so far finally come to fruition and the stage is set for the final book. Picking up where the story left off Garion finds himself leading the small group as Belgarath is out of it after the last show down and Polgara is maintaining a shield to protect Errand. What follows is Garion not just making the journey into adult hood but also stepping up into a position of responsibility and authority. Garion finally grows up and it is wonderful to see.The middle of the book does drag a bit as it gets bogged down in some very necessary but at least mostly peaceful politics. Stick with it to the last third and you will be rewarded.This book features a major plot twist to set up the fifth and final book, and I won't spoil it for you except to say that Garion is not the only one that does some major growing up, Ce'Nedra does as well. And, finally, we see some sparks start to really fly between our two annoying love birds.We also finally get to journey through Drasnia and of course see the prince, Silk, in his element. The ending will leave you begging for the final book in the series.I listened to this entire series on audio book and I just have to say that the reader for this series, Cameron Beierle, is phenomenal. Not only does he have a different, unique, and distinct voice for each of the characters but each kingdom has its own unique accent. The moment you hear him start to speak a line of dialogue you can tell what kingdom they are from immediately. He is an excellent reader and I can't recommend his audio books enough."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Just when I thought things were going to comet to some sort of conclusion.. David Eddings throws me for a spin with the ending of this book.But I get ahead of myself -In Castle of Wizardry Belgarion finally comes into his own - sort of. The prophecy peaks, things we, as readers, have known since the first and second book are revealed (and the characters are surprised by them? Really?). I suppose it would have helped, also, to have the prophecy revealed at the start of each book so we could see the pieces coming together as well - but that isn't how it's to be, so we really don't know just how explicit it is.This book and The Magician's Gambit suffer a bit from \\"middle-child syndrome\\", all things said. It's obvious that the story is hurtling toward a grand finish, but first we have to get through all of the revelations and traveling - and there is a LOT of traveling. That said, I'm looking forward to seeing what the end brings and have thoroughly enjoyed a weekend completely absorbed in this world created by David Eddings."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"When I say intermediate, I mean it as an intermediate stage between two quests: one to reclaim the Orb, and the next quest for Garion to fulfill his destiny. I've been re-reading the Belgariad for the first time in 20 years, and was surprised at how strong this book was upon re-read. One can tell how Eddings has matured as a writer from Magician's Gambit to Castle of Wizardry. An example of this is when Garion creates the flower for his cousin, Adara-the reader can sense the quiet intensity of this scene as the flower is left behind while they ride away. This is the first example of such a scene in the Belgariad (although there are other examples).This book comes across as the reflective one of this series. Garion has a homecoming at Faldor's Farm, where he makes peace with his past (Zubrette), and forces himself to move on. It's a poignant scene, and the reader can feel how hard it was for Garion to get the closure he needed at that place.While the revelation of Garion as the Rivan King may not come across as too surprising, the reactions surrounding him are quite humorous, especially Ce'Nedra's \\"OH NO!\\". While Ce'Nedra may come across as a spoiled, whiny princess (which she is), Eddings does a fine job of displaying how petulant she can be when being forced into circumstances. The reader may not like how the character behaves, but the last section of the book (The Rivan Queen) does a good job of displaying Ce'Nedra growing up in the face of the coming war.The Drasnia sequence was intense and taut for two scenes in particular. The first is the scene at the witch Vorhai's house. Eddings does a great job of converging emotional, philosophical and physical issues all in this scene. The questions of should nature be altered to our liking juxtaposes with a man's ability being put to the test are front and center in this scene. The second scene is in Boktor, where Silk's facade crumbles in the meeting with his mother and Queen Porenn. It's a powerful scene because Silk's bluff bravado has constantly served as a buffer against any danger, and it's frightful for Garion to see Silk exposed and raw in this scene. Great writing in this scene.While this book can be viewed as a staging book within the Belgariad, it serves a deeper purpose for the characters to face their fears and resolve to move on in spite of those fears. Castle of Wizardry is a well-balanced book, and arguably the finest book in the Belgariad."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"This is the fourth book in the Belgariad (after Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery and Magician's Gambit, and before Enchanter's End Game).After Ctuchik accidentally destroyed himself in Rak Cthol, the rock pinnacle upon which the city is built has started crumbling on itself and our heroes have to flee through the caves, taking the small boy Errand and the Marag slave woman Taiba with them.Back on solid ground, they make for Algaria where Hettar is waiting with reinforcements. For that they have to cross the Eastern Escarpment, go down its deep ravines, and the entire Murgo nation is now pursuing them. After his ordeal in Rak Cthol, and protecting his crew from rocks thrown at them for several days, Belgarath collapses.Yet there is no time to lose, as all protagonists must now converge to the island of Riva, to be there before Erastide in order to fulfill the Prophecy. There both Garion and Ce'Nedra will finally understand their role and embrace their heritage.But when Garion touches the Orb, the slumbering evil god Torak awakes, and the Prophecy says that Garion is the only one who can confront him, alone. He has no choice but to secretly leave, with just Silk and a recovering Belgarath as company. Meanwhile, Ce' Nedra eavesdrops on the Alorn Kings' discussions and realizes she's the only one who can unite the armies of the West in the oncoming war with the invading Angaraks.There isn't much to say about this volume which would differ from the previous ones, but it was nice to see some loose ends finally tied up. I enjoyed the flight through the caves of Rak Cthol and the meeting in boggy Sendaria with Vordai and her cute otter-like creatures, the Fenlings. I am now looking forward to reading what lies in store for Garion in the final volume, and also to seeing which hints will be dropped about the sequel, the Malloreon."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Once again I wish for a \\"half-star\\" rating, as this deserves a 3 1/2. I love the series, but this was the weakest of the five books in my opinion. There were interesting parts, and the dialogue, the sense of humor and even some of the twists and events are really enjoyable. I like the interaction between the kings as well, which is quite interesting.I will say that if there were an area of criticism for Eddings it is in the lack of variety of some of the people. I have heard others call it his \\"Star-Trek Worldbuilding\\". All Alorns are \\"this way\\" all Mimbrates are \\"this way\\". A little more depth in this area would have made this a masterful series and book.Even without it though this is a series that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"For people who enjoy reading for the purpose of getting into the story. The books written by David Eddings' are for people who get attached to characters and love to immerse themselves in reading. To me his books are like coming home for a visit.If you want to read simply to get to the finish line---Eddings is not for you."},{"Title":"The Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad Ser., Bk. 4)","review":"Eddings gets better and better as we follow the journey of young Garion toward his battle with Torak. In \\"Castle or Wizardry\\" our young hero reaches the end of the quest for the Orb of Aldur only to discover his greatest challenge lies ahead. He will be put in a position so far beyond his humble beginnings that his mind will reel. In the meantime the company of heroes we've followed through the first three books face very different challenges in the days leading to war with the powers of the East. The most daunting task is set for Ce'Nedra in a twist you may not see coming. Mysteries are revealed and new adventures begun. This is a great addition to an epic that will remain a favorite for a long time to come."},{"Title":"How to Be a Successful Teenager: 18 Secrets Every Teen Must Know to Succeed","review":"It has been my privilege to work with teenagers since 1971, which adds up to 34 years, if my calculations don't fail me!

Here is a book where someone just tells the truth. And tells it like it is. And the author meticulously sites all his sources for example the one about \\"AIDS being able to pass even thru microscopic holes in condoms\\". Or his claim about the fact that when \\"800 sexologists were asked at a conference if they'd trust condoms to protect them from AIDS, not a single one raised their hand.\\"The fact that some people find the truths in this book offensive is very telling and very dangerous.

Outright, blatant LIES over which I am surprised that no one pursued litigation against Mr. Jones. One laughable example is where the author stated that Hustler magazine ran an article that gave detailed instructions on how to mutilate children; another lie was that the HIV virus can pass through a condom; and there was yet another ludicrous allegation that John Lennon was a servant of Satan. The book also states that homosexuals can be cured, and that listening to Ozzy Osbourne's music and playing Dungeons and Dragons invites demons into one's body.I think that making a teenager read a book filled with this kind of disinformation borders on child abuse."},{"Title":"How to Be a Successful Teenager: 18 Secrets Every Teen Must Know to Succeed","review":"Oh boy, where to start?Parents - do you love your children?
